[PREFACE]  
  
[This Pali Poem "Pabanda Siromani" a history of the Buddha was composed by us at the  
request of the late Mr.M.A. Fernando, a highly respected gentleman, who lived at "Meth  
Medura" in Moratuwa. It comprises the Buddha's history from His meeting with Dipankara  
Buddha to His Parinibbana.]  
  
[The life of the Buddha, His many excellences, and His great personality has not been fully  
described in one particular place in the text and the Commentaries of the Dhamma. Hence  
he who wishes to study the Buddha's life has to read through the Tripitakas and though a  
very few Pali scholars might find the time to do so, the average persom would find it a  
difficult task.]   
[Consequently the collection in one composition of all that has been said of the Buddha in  
the various texts and commentaries is valuable not only to Buddhists but also to other  
religionists who seek for information about the founders of religions.]  
  
[Though prose would be more convenient for a book of this nature, yet we decided to write  
this book in poetry because of the greater keenness of both the East and the West in the  
study of poetry and because of the paucity of Pali Poems, the few existing ones being only  
"Kandakavyas" or poems interspersed with prose.]  
  
[Many are the prose works in Pali on Grammar, Vinaya and Abidhamma, but the only  
poems worth trudy are the "Dathawansa" written about 800 years ago by Bhikku  
Dharmakirti of Ceylon, the"Jinalankaraya" written about 700 years ago by Bhikku  
Buddharakhita of Ceylon, the "Pajjamadhu" about 500 years ago by Bhikku Buddhappiya,  
the "Samantakuta Warnana" by Bhikku Wedeha and "The Hatthawanagalla Vihara Wansa"  
by an anonynons author about the same time as the "Pajjamadhu," and in later times the  
"Paramisataaka" by Bhikku Anuruddha, the "Jinacarita" by Bhikku Medankara and less than  
a century the "Jinacarita" by Bhikku Medankara and less than a century ago the  
"Sasanawansadipa" by Wimalasara, Nayaka Thero of Welitara.]  
  
  
[SL Page -ii] [\x  /]       
  
[All these poems are Khandakavyas and a Khandakavya compared with a Mahakavya] [a  
purely work] [seems but a pencil sketch of a great artist, whereas the latter in a most  
esquisite life-like painting in true colours by a master artist.]  
  
[These poems, great as they are in Pali, stand no comparison with such Sanskrit poems as  
the "Raghuwansa," "Kumarasambhawa," "Sisupalawadha," "Bhattikavya" and the  
"Kiratarjuniya," The Sinhalese peoms "Sasada," "Muwadevda," "Kavsilumina" and the  
"Kavyasekere" should be held superior to these Pali poems as the former have been  
moddelled on Sanskrit poems.]  
  
[Pali poems hold an inferior position because in them the story has been delineated like  
drawing in outline and is not adorned by poetic art and they serve more to give instruction  
than to souse the pleasure and delight of man. The authors of these poems were  
undoubtedly capaabsle, if they wished, of producing literary works in no way inferior to  
Sanskrit poems.]  
  
[Hundreds are the great poems in Sanskrit, but the only two that take the Buddha as their  
theme are the "Padyacudamani" by the great teacher Buddhagosa and the "Buddhacarita" by  
the Brahman Teacher, Asaaghosa. Yet these do not treat suffciently of the Dhamma.]  
  
[Even among the aforesaid Pali poems, though the "Jinacarita," "Samantajutawarnana,"  
"Dathawansa" and the "Sasanawansadipa" in their introduction mention the life of the  
Buddha, none of them has a complete account of the Buddha's life. The "Jinalankara," which  
contains a thorough description of the Buddha's qualities,does not give His life-history. A  
few Sinhalese, Burmese and Siamese prose works and the "Light of Asia" by Edvin Arnold  
contain descriptive accounts of the life of the Buddha.]  
  
[Except the "Kavyasekara" by Sangaraja Sri Rahula who lived about 500 years ago at  
Totagamuwa, none of the other works that deal with the Buddha][s life-history are poetic as  
wll as instructive of the Dhamma.]  
  
  
[SL Page iii] [\x /]       
  
[With all due respect and veneration to the great masters of literary art that have produced  
these poems, we commend this effort of ours the "Pabanda Siromani" or the "Jinawansadipa"  
as a work posessing both those attributes.]

difficult metrical arrangements as the "Slesa" and the "Yamaka" and also expounds such  
deep sections of the Dhamma as the "Patticea Samuppada.]"  
  
[We also express our deepest feeling of gratitude to all our teachers in this country and in  
Burma and in particular to Maha Thero W. Sanghananda of "Kshertrarama," Laxapatiya,  
Moratuwa.]  
  
[We also offer the merits gained by this effort of ours to our mother]la [the late  
Ponnahannedige Anjela Dias and our father, the late Merennage Kalistoru Fernando of  
Moratuwa, generally known as Puran Appu Wedarala] [Native Doctor] [and also to the late  
respected Merennage Arnolis Fernando of Meth Medura of Moratuwa, at whose request the  
work was undertaken and who helped us in the printing of the book and also to his son  
James Alfred Fernando, who, on the death of his father, continued the good work begun by  
him.]  
  
[This preface in English was also added because we expect this book to go to the hands of  
European and Indian Scholars through whom the knowledge of the Buddha may spread  
through the world.]
