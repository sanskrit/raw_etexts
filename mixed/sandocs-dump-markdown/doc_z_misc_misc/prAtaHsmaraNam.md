 प्रातःस्मरणम्   
  
The Pratasmaranam consists of some verses that are to be recited in  
the morning soon after waking up from the bed. प्रातः = at dawn, and  
स्मरणम् = remembering. They may be recited sitting in the bed itself  
before getting out of it. They are an aid to remembering many venerable  
people and auspecious things in the creation, and through them the Lord.  
There are many versions of this poem containing  less number of verses  
or more. One well known version is that of Sri Sankaracharya and this  
consists of just four verses. These verses are highly significant as  
they contain thoughts about the godhead residing within us. These four  
can be easily memorised and are a pleasure to recite if one knows the  
meaning. The text of the verses is given below to help those who are  
interested in reciting them. Then each verse is given with its meaning.  
They are also followed by some comments.

The Pratasmaranam is a stotram स्तोत्रम् or hymn. A stotram is  
defined as गुण सङ्कीर्तनम् । (VS) or stating the attributes. The  
Pratasmaranam may be taken as   extolling the glory विभूतिः of the  
Lord.  The glory that is extolled is His omnipresence: that He is every  
where and as every thing. The Upanishad says this clearly:  that whatever  
is seen or heard of in this universe is permeated by the Lord, in and out.  
%begin shloka  
  
यच्च किञ्चित्जगत्यस्मिन् दृश्यते श्रूयतेऽपि वा ।  
अन्तर्बहिश्च तत् सर्वं व्याप्य नारायणः स्थितः ॥ (Taittariyaranyaka, 10-II-4-6)  
%end shloka  
More on this subject is discussed later on in this article.  THE MORNING  
TIME:- The morning time, just before the sun rise and the evening  
time just before the sunset are recommended for prayer  because the  
mind is calm and fresh at these times. So, they are ideal for prayer  
and meditation. The practice of meditating and praying at these times  
have been in vogue since time immemorial. The vedas say that one should  
meditate on the Sun as the Supreme Being at both these times . Doing so,  
one will be blessed with all good things in life and attain liberation..  %begin shloka  
  
उद्यन्तमस्तं यन्तमादित्यमभिध्यायन्, कुर्वन्,  
ब्राह्मणो विद्वान्सकलं भद्रमश्नुते  
असावादित्यो ब्रह्मेति, ब्रह्मैव सन्-ब्रह्माप्येति, य एवं वेद ।  
%end shloka  
Our scriptures also say that one should use this time only for meditating  
on the Lord  and add that one who does not, but sleeps at this time,  
that sleep eats into his stock of punyam (result of doing good deeds).  
ब्राह्मे मुहूर्ते या निद्रा सा पुण्यक्षयकारिणी । In addition to losing  
punyam the person incurs sin. This is said by Bharata in Ramayana. He  
states that he who had any part in making Rama abdicate the kingdom and  
go to the forests should incur the sin of a person who sleeps at either  
of the junctions (of the day and night). Valmiki Ramayana (2-75-44).  %begin shloka  
  
उभे सन्ध्ये शयानस्य यत् पापं परिकल्पते । तच्च  
पापं भवेत् तस्य यस्यार्योऽनुमतो गतः ॥  
%end shloka  
Later on, when Bharata met Rama at Chitrakoot, Rama enquired about the welfare  
of his father and others. He then gave instructions in judicature. One of the  
questions he put to Bharata was ᳚I hope you do not fall a prey to excess  
of sleep and wake up early in the morning.᳚  कच्चिन्निद्रावशं नैषि  
कच्चित् कालेऽवबुध्यसे । (2-100-17).  
  
The junction of the day and night, (i.e) the time of sun rise and the sun  
set (the twilight hour) is known as सन्ध्या (sandhya). There are two  
sandhyas ; the morning one and the evening one. They are known as the  
the प्रातः सन्ध्या and the सायं सन्ध्या. We have to dedicate  
the sandhya time for prayers only and not for any other activity like  
eating and, much less for sleeping.  
ब्राह्मे मुहूर्ते उत्थाय चिन्तयेदात्मनो हितम् ।  
गुरुं विष्णुं नमस्कृत्य मातरं पितरं तथा ।  
  
One should wake up before sunrise and think of his own welfare. He  
should salute his guru, Lord Vishnu, mother and father.  We may recall  
that Rama and LakShmana accompanied the sage Viswamitra to the forests  
and rested for the night on the bank of the Sarayu river. Just when the  
day was about to break, the sage woke them up saying that the twilight  
सन्ध्या has set in and it is time for prayer.  %begin shloka  
  
कौसल्या सुप्रजा राम पूर्वा सन्ध्या प्रवर्तते ।  
उत्तिष्ठ नरशार्दूल कर्तव्यं दैवमान्हिकम् ॥  
%end shloka  
This verse is from Ramayana (1-23-2) and is very popular. It is recited  
as part of the Suprabhatam.  We learn that Sri Krishna too used to get  
up very early in the morning and meditate on the Supreme Being.  Then,  
He had bath and performed sandhya vandanam. He silently chanted the  
Gayatri mantra.  BH(10-70-4,6).  %begin shloka  
  
ब्राह्मे मुहूर्त उत्थाय वार्युपस्पृश्य माधवः ।  
दध्यौ प्रसन्न करण आत्मानं तमसः परम् ॥  
  
अथाप्लुतोऽम्भस्यमले यथाविधि क्रियाकलापं परिधाय वाससी ।  
चकार सन्ध्योपगमादि सत्तमो हुतानलो ब्रह्म जजाप वाग्यतः ॥  
  
%एन्द् श्लोक  
 These facts establish the importance of praying at the  
sandhya times.  Why should we recite such verses as the first thing  
in the morning instead of going about our routine morning ablution?  
If we study our life we will find that it was not all smooth, but it  
had some stretches of happiness and also of sorrow. What is happiness  
and gives us joy and what is sorrow and causes pain and grief depends  
on time, place and circumstances. Thus there is no uniform definition  
of joy and sorrow.  But our aim is to avoid sorrow in any form as  
much as possible and have happiness and happiness only.  The question  
is whether such a condition is possible? It seems to be a dream like  
situation. Though the condition appears to be fanciful and impractical  
to achieve, our scriptures assert that such a life which is full of pure,  
unalloyed joy is achievable. The way to achieve to attain such a life is  
through devotion or bhakti. Sorrow is the result of the doing (prohibited)  
sinful actions and failing to do prescribed duties we have committed in  
this and earlier human births. Sage Yagnavalkya says this: %begin shloka  
  
विहितस्याननुष्ठानात् निन्दितस्य च सेवनात् ।  
अनिग्रहाच्चेन्द्रियाणां नरः पतनमृच्छति ॥  
%end shloka  
The big bundle of sins we  
have accumulated in so many births is to be expended by experiences in  
the form of sorrow and pain by us. Sorrow afflicts the mind and pain  
affects the body. Since the stock of sins is huge, this one birth may  
not suffice to work it out. So one has to go through painful experiences  
in this birth and  in addition, one may have to be born again and again  
many times to clear off the debt. The way out of this dreadful situation  
is to resort to bhakti. In the introduction to Shri Vishnusahasranamam  
the king Yudhishtira asks Bhishma the easiest way for one to get rid  
of sorrows and attain happiness. Bhishma replies that the way is to  
chant the glories of the Lord.  %begin shloka  
  
अनादिनिधनं विष्णुं सर्वलोकमहेश्वरम् ।  
लोकाध्यक्षं स्तुवन्नित्यं सर्वदुःखादिगो भवेत् ।  
%end shloka  
So, the Lord has the names पुण्यः - स्मृतिमात्रेण  
कल्मषाणि क्षपयतीति पुण्यः । VS(687).  He removes the sins of those  
who just think of Him.  and हरिः - स्मृतिमात्रेण पुंसां पापं  
संसारं वा हरतीति हरिः । VS(359) and SS(542).  पापनाशकरः -  
लौकिकवैदिकनामभिः कीर्तितः, तथा लौकिकवैदिकैः स्तोत्रैः स्तुतः,  
तथा पञ्चाक्षरादिभिर्जप्तः पूजितश्च उमासहायत्वादिरूपेण स्मृतो  
ध्यानेन वा पापनाशकरः । SS(355). He destroys the sins of those  
who repeat His holy names or chant hymns or chant mantras such as the  
panchakShara.  
  
As children, we were taught to worship God in pictures and idols in the  
home and in temples. This is necessary to get the mind fixed on the  
Lord. This form of worship is relevant to the beginners and also all  
through the life and is very important. One cannot view this as mere  
idol worship.  In addition, we also listened to stories from puranas. We  
were told that God created the world.  He first created Brahma who  
then created the world. He resides in places like Vaikunta and Kailas;  
but will come to rescue His devotees as He did in the case of Prahlada  
and Gajendra. Listening to such stories made us know more about God  
and His qualities. In this way listening draws our minds to Him and  
sows the seeds of bhakti or devotion. It is said that bhakti wells up  
in the heart of one who listens to the exposition of sacrd texts like  
Bhagavatam. Such devotion dispels grief and fear.BH(1-7-7) %begin shloka  
  
यस्यां वै श्रूयमाणायां कृष्णे परमपूरुषे ।  
भक्तिरुत्पद्यते पुंसां शोकमोहभयापहा ॥  
%end shloka  
Please note the usage of  
the word भक्तिरुत्पद्यते meaning that devotion springs up in the  
hearts of people.  This implies that devotion sprouts up in the hearts  
even where the seeds are absent earlier. Such is the glory of listening  
to the holy texts.  Because of this fact chanting and listening to the  
glories of the Lord is highly recommended. The many hymns available to  
us are of great help to us in this matter. They elaborately describe the  
glorious attributes of the Lord.  Since one has his own duties to perform  
throughout the day our tradition has introduced the practice of prayers  
at different times of the day, like the Pratasmaranam right from the  
time one wakes up in the morning till one retires to bed. This helps us  
to keep remembering the Lord. Our minds will not stray away from Him and  
so will remain pure and calm. Just as we take food at regular intervals  
to remain healthy and ward of pangs of hunger, similarly by indulging  
in small doses of bhakti at regular intervals in between our activities  
we can mitigate the adverse effects  of past karma. This will cushion  
our journey through life.  GOD'S NATURE:- If we want to think more of  
God we would like to know more of His form and nature. The question,  
then, is what is His form and nature?  Is His nature the ones stated  
above, namely those available in the idols and pictures and available  
in Vaikunta and Kailasa?  The answer to this is discussed in detail in  
chapters 7 to 11 of Bhagavat Gita.  God has two aspects. In His higher  
nature He is without form or any other attributes. He is therefore known  
as निर्गुणः । VS(840).  
  
ISHVARA:-  In His other aspect He is known as Ishvara and is accompanied  
by His power of maya.  As Ishwara He is the cause of the universe. This is  
the topic of discussion in this article.The universe which is the effect  
or product is born or made of Him - the cause. It is like saying the  
ornaments are made of gold - the cause. One may say that that to make the  
ornaments out of gold we require two causes - a goldsmith to fashion the  
ornaments. Thus we have the gold - the material cause and the goldsmith -  
the intelligent cause (the one who provides the expertise necesassary to  
make the ornament using the gold).  But in the case of the universe God  
is both the material and the efficient cause. He is known as कारणम् -  
उपादानं निमित्तं च कारणम् । VS(379). He does not need the help of  
any external agency in this process.  We have the example of the humble  
spider which is able to spin the thread from its mouth and withdraw it  
back into itself without any external help.  यथोर्णनाभिः सृजते  
गृण्हते च ।  . MU (1-1-7) We may ask one question here. When we  
say that an ornament, say bangle, is made of gold - the cause, what is  
᳚bangle᳚? Is it something different from the gold?  The answer is ᳚No᳚. We  
can say that gold is bangle.  This is because of the fact that what we  
call ᳚bangle᳚ is only the name given to a particular form of gold. If  
we take the gold away from the ᳚bangle᳚ by melting it, we will be left  
with gold and no ᳚bangle᳚.  Such a thing that seems to exist, but does  
not indeed exist separately is called मिथ्या or unreal. We have the  
familiar example of the mirage. In these ᳚mithya᳚ cases we should note  
that gold only is seen as bangle and sand as water. Vedanta texts give  
the example of one seeing a ᳚snake᳚ in a rope and getting frightened at  
the ᳚snake᳚. Thus the mithya objects can produce effects: but they do  
not exist. Things like the rope or gold that support the appearance of  
mithya objects like the snake and ornaments are known as अधिष्ठानम्  
। or substratum. For this reason, God, who is the substratum of the  
mithya universe  has the name अधिष्ठानम् - अधितिष्ठन्ति भूतानि  
उपाधानकारणत्वेन ब्रह्मेति अधिष्ठानम्,  
᳚मत्स्थानि सर्वभूतानि᳚ (गीता ९-४) इति भगवत्वचनात् ।  
 VS(324). This is said more explicitly by the name  
 मिथ्याजगदधिष्ठाना - मिथ्यारूपस्य जगतोऽधिष्ठानं  
भानाधिकरणं रजतस्येव शुक्तिः । LS(734).  
She (Lalitha) is the support of the unreal world, like the shell of  
silver.  A shell shines like silver in the sun light and one may indeed  
mistake it for silver. Thus the real shell supports the appearance of  
the unreal silver.  We said that God is the cause of the universe. This  
means that God is only seen as the universe, just as gold is seen as  
bangle. Thus the Lord has the name:- विश्वम् -  
कार्यरूप जगतः कारणत्वेन विश्वं इत्युच्यते ब्रह्म ।  
He being the cause is seen as the product universe. VS(1).  
  
The ornaments are many and different, but the gold is one and the same.  
Gold permeates the ornaments and gives them substance. So also, the whole  
world made up of numerous objects is permeated by the Lord. He gives them  
substance Every object is in Him but He is not in them. This is because the  
objects are only mithya and have no existance apart from the cause - the  
Lord  Krishna says this clearly.  BG(9-4).  %begin shloka  
  
मया ततमिदं सर्वं जग-दव्यक्त-मूर्तिना ।  
मत्स्थानि सर्वभूतानि न चाहं तेष्ववस्थितः ॥  
%end shloka  
  
The fact that the universe is the form of God implies that all objects  
or products with names and forms, from Brahma the creator to an  
insignificant insect, are all His forms only. This is expressed in His  
name विश्वरूपी - विश्वानि सर्वाणि चेतनाचेतनात्मकानि रूपाणि अस्य  
सन्तीति विश्वरूपी He has the forms of all the animate and inanimate  
objects in the universe. SS(75). Arjuna, with the grace of Krishna,  
sees this form. The description of this form and Arjuna's reaction to  
this is described in BG-Ch11.  But as is the case with the rope snake,  
the objects in the world make us believe they are real. We see the cause  
and the product as separate things.  We are beguiled by the forms of the  
ornaments to such an extent that we overlook the content - gold. In like  
fashion, we are so thoroughly lost in the world of names and forms that  
we miss the Lord who is really the substance behind them. This makes us  
see multiplicity. We see individuals as separate entities and as different  
from us. From this arises a veriety of emotions such as, likes, dislikes,  
jealousy, hatred etc.  These feelings affect us. We express love for some,  
dislike for some and so on.  We love some items - like wealth, very much  
because we feel they have some special qualities in them and work very  
hard to get them.  We love our family more than other's family. These  
actions lead to conflict and strife. The result is sorrow.  
  
BENEFITS OF THE NEW UNDERSTANDING: But when we are understand that what  
all we see is His forms only our outlook changes totally. We do not  
notice differences among them, but see only the substance God.  We cannot  
hate any thing because every thing is divine. We can have only love for  
all beings. Further, love takes a special meaning and is replaced by  
devotion. This idea is impressed in our minds even as we are young by  
teaching us to respect our mother, father, acharya and the elders who  
may visit our house as God. The Taittariyopanishad (1-11) instucts us  
in this matter.  मातृ देवो भव । पितृ देवो भव । आचार्य देवो  
भव । अतिथि देवो भव । We wer asked to worship our text books  
as Sarasvathi, the Goddess of learning. Every thing in the creation,  
be it animate  or inanimate becomes an object of worship, since it is  
His form only. Thus we have the custom of worshipping trees, rivers,  
cows, etc., since we see divinity in them.  
  
The great devotee Prahlada had this vision. He said that because the Lord is  
every where and in the form of every thing it becomes very easy to  
worship Him. BH(7-6-27).  %begin shloka  
  
न ह्यच्युतं प्रीणयतो बह्वायासोऽसुरात्मजाः ।  
आत्मत्वात् सर्वभूतानां सिद्धत्वा-दिह सर्वतः ॥  
%end shloka  
The seers of ancient India had this wonderful vision. The famous vedic hymn  
Sri Rudram salutes the Supreme Being as Lord Rudra not by names as in a  
Sahasranama but as being resident in various objects and beings.  It salutes  
Rudra as being dogs, the lowly outcastes, the cheat, the robber, the trees,  
the sand dunes and so on.  Thus there can  
be nothing bad in the creation but the Lord only and so they all deserve  
our respect.  Saint Ramakrishna Paramahamsa had such a vision. When some  
prostitutes were introduced into the room to test his character, he rose  
and prostrated to them as he saw them as the images of Devi only.  
  
Since everything is divine, we cannot destroy or pollute the environment  
because it will amount to showing disrespect to the Lord. Naturally, this is  
a very high stage in spiritual progress. Rarely one will find people  
who have got such a vision. However we have to understand this fact clearly,  
take it seriously and try to develop such a vision. But if we fail to do so  
and confine our worship of God to images and pictures in our houses and  
temples, we will  stagnate. Lord, in His incarnation as Kapila,  
says this. BH(3-30-21 to 27).  
Some select verses are given below.  %begin shloka  
  
अहं सर्वेषु भूतेषु भूतात्मावस्थितः सदा ।  
तमवज्ञाय मां मर्त्यः कुरुतेऽर्चाविडम्बनम् ॥ २१।  
यो मां सर्वेषु भूतेषु सन्तमात्मानमीश्वरम् ।  
हित्वार्चां भजते मौढ्याद्भस्मन्येव जुहोति सः ॥ २२।  
%end shloka  
The Lord says that He resides in all beings as their inner  
soul. Disregarding this fact, people make a show of worshipping Me  
through images.If one disregards My prescence in all, but ignorantly  
offers worship only to images, such worship is wasteful as the sacrificial  
offferings poured into ashes.  The worship of God in pictures and images  
is important. It should continue as this is the stepping stone to higher  
forms of worship.  But we should not forget the fact that God is present  
not only in images but also as all things.  
  
When we understanding the fact that God is in every thing and every where, we  
find that we can never be alone at any time, but are always surrounded by Him.  
Krishna makes this very clear. BG(6-30).  %begin shloka  
  
यो मां पश्यति सर्वत्र सर्वं च मयि पश्यति ।  
तस्याहं न प्रणश्यामि स च मे न प्रणश्यति ॥  
%end shloka  
A bird flying in the air is surrounded by air in all directions. Similarly  
we are surrounded by the Lord who is all pervading. He is before,  
behind, to the right, to the left, below and above - manifests Himself  
in all forms.  %begin shloka  
  
ब्रह्मैवेदममृतं पुरस्ताद्ब्रह्म पश्चाद्ब्रह्म दक्षिणतश्चोत्तरेण ।  
अधश्चोर्ध्वं च प्रसृतं ब्रह्मैवेदं विश्वमिदं वरिष्ठम् ॥  
MU (2-2-11).  
%end shloka  
Because of this reason, we have His company at all times and so we should  
feel immensely secure .  
  
Though we hear that every thing in the creation is divine, but because  
our minds are not pure, but are coloured with likes and dislikes we feel  
some things are pure and holy and some are ᳚dirty᳚ or ᳚lowly᳚.  So we  
are not able to see see Him in such objects. We want a way out of this  
awkward situation. Arjuna too, who had love towards some and hatred for  
some, had the same problem and puts the question to Krishna. He asked  
Him in which forms He can be meditated upon or worshipped. BG(10-17).  %begin shloka  
  
कथं विद्यामहं योगिंस्त्वां सदा परिचिन्तयन् ।  
केषु केषु च भावेषु चिन्त्योऽसि भगवन्मया ॥  
%end shloka  
Krishna understands Arjuna's predicament and gives a list of items in  
which He may be worshipped or meditaed upon. But He makes a significant  
observation. He says that the list is not exhaustive but whatever there is  
that has some special glory or strength etc., is part of His manifestation  
only. BG(11-41).  %begin shloka

Uddhava, the friend of Krishna, puts the same question to Krishna  
and Krishna gives a list of items (BH 11- Chapter 16) in which He  
may be meditated upon. He concludes with a similar statement saying  
᳚Wherever there is power, beauty, fame, prosperity, modesty, sacrifice,  
agreeableness, luck, strength, fortitude or knowledge, there am I  
manifested. BH(11-16-40).  %begin shloka

From this we understand that any special quality or glory, like beauty,  
strength, talent etc.,  we observe any where or in any one, really  
belongs to God only. Because of this reason, whenever we think of an  
item or person with some special quality or greatness we should realise  
that we are thinking of a repository of His glory only.  The hymn  
Pratasmaranam mentions a list of  such items that have some special  
glory. These includes a wide assortment including rivers, mountains,  
kings, sages etc..The greatness we observe in them really belongs to  
Him only and so we  marvel at His glory and feel humble. Therefore by  
the remembrance of these items we learn to remember the Lord as being  
inherent in every thing. We can no more ask as to how to see God,  
because we are seeing Him all the time. It is said that once some one  
told Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi that he wants to see God and requested  
Bhagavan to help him. Bhagavan said that he cannot help the visitor in  
this task since what he is seeing is God only.  
  
Accepting these facts takes us one step higher than worshipping Him in  
idols and images. With this kind of thinking permeating our mind, we  
can go out and face our day with confidence.It can only be auspecious.  
A popular verse says this and asks how can one who has made his heart  
as the abode of the Lord face failure?  %begin shloka

Let us now proceed to the stotram proper. The translations given are  
not exact, but will help to understand the meaning of the verses. Some  
comments are also provided. The comments are confined to some items  
only since many of the names and items mentioned in the stotra will be  
familiar to all.  %begin shloka  
  
कराग्रे वसते लक्ष्मीः करमध्ये सरस्वती ।  
करमूले तु गौरी च प्रभाते करदर्शनम्  ॥ १॥  
%end shloka  
Meaning:- Laksmi ( the goddess of wealth) resides in the upper part  
of hands, Sarasvati (the goddess of learning) resides in the middle,  
and Gauri (the goddess of valour) in the lower part. Therefore, every  
morning one should respectfully have a look at one's hands.  
  
Notes:- We have five ᳚organs of action᳚ -  पञ्च कर्मेन्द्रियाणि ।  
These are speech, the hands, the legs, the anus and the  
genitals. वाक्-पाणि-पाद-पायूपस्थानीति पञ्च कर्मेन्द्रियाणि ।  
(Tattva Bodah).  The ᳚organs᳚ are not the physical ones but the power  
behind them. Thus one may have his leg in tact, but may be unable to  
move it about because of some disease and the power is gone. This power  
resident in the organ is derived from the Lord only. This is said in  
the scriptures.  %begin shloka

He salutes the Lord saying that He had entered into him through His  
intelligent power and roused his dormant power of speech. Being the  
Lord of all powers, He had also kindled to activity also all his other  
organs.  Though He is the Lord of all powers, He weilds it through  
various deities. This is like saying that the President is the head of  
the country, but he exercises the power through many officers. It is so  
with the powers resident in the organs of the body. The power in an organ  
is called the presiding deity or अधिष्ठाता देवता । Each of the  
organs have its own presiding deity. Even though all these organs are  
all equally important for leading an active and happy life, the hands  
are considered ᳚more equal᳚ than the other organs. They are needed for  
performing the obligatory duties known as the five great yagnas पञ्च  
महा यज्ञानि ।.  They include worship of God, the manes, the rishis,  
the guests and the animals and plants.  Because of this reason, the deity  
presiding over the hands is Indra. Indra in this case means the Supreme  
Being. तस्मादिदन्द्रो नामेदन्द्रो ह वै नाम तमिदन्द्रं सन्तमिन्द्र  
इत्याचक्षते परोक्षेण । (Aitareyopanishad 1-14).  He is the One who  
sees all. He helps us to use the hands and do the enjoined duties. He  
is on the other side accepting them and blesses us with the fruits of  
these actions. Thus, by discharging our duties we can achieve all the  
goals of life known as पुरुषार्थाः । So, the vedic hymn Sri Rudram  
says the hands are greatly blessed, in fact more blessed than the other  
organs. The reason is simple.  It has the fortune to come into contact  
with the auspecious body of the Lord (in the form of idols) during His  
worship. He is called the universal physician. By worshipping Him one  
may get rid of his sorrows and achieve all the goals of life including  
the most prized one - salvation (mokSha) itself.  %begin shloka

The benefits one may get from the worship of the Lord include knowledge,  
wealth, stamina etc. These are very essential for living happily and  
to do our duties, both secular and religious. These are got by the  
blessings of the Goddesses LakShmi, Sarasvathi and Gauri - who are all  
the Lord's manifestations only.  So all the Devis also said to reside  
in the hands. Thus, by looking at the hands we get to remember the Lord;  
and this in turn is equivalent to looking at the three Devis. Here too, we  
should remember that the ᳚Devis᳚ are one only. Thus we find the the names  
LakShmi, Sarasvathi and Gauri in the 1008 names of LakShmi.  %begin shloka

Meaning:- O Devi! You are wearing the ocean as a clothing on your body.  
The mountains are your breasts!  O Consort of Visnu! I salute you and beg  
your pardon for having to set foot on your body for my routine activities.  
  
Notes: - This verse is addressed to the goddess of earth, called Bhu  
Devi. She sustains all life on this earth and is verily the mother of  
all living beings, including the plants and animals. Like the saree worn  
by a lady, the oceans cover most of the Goddess Earth. Like the milk  
flowing from the breasts of a mother provides nourishment to her child,  
the waters flowing down the mountains provide nourihment to the land and  
the people. Her glory is sung by the vedic hymn भू सूक्तम् and by many  
poets.  Acharya Vedanta Desika's poem Bhustuti is very popular  In one of  
the verses he says that the Bhu Devi is very close to the Lord. This is  
evident from the fact that when we start reciting the Gayatri mantra the  
word भूः which represnts Bhu Devi immediately follows ॐ which  
represents the Lord.  त्वं व्याहृतिः प्रथमतः प्रणवः प्रियस्ते  
संवेदयत्यखिल मन्त्र गणास्तमेव । In  fact the Lord Himself  
is in the form of the earth . भूः . VS(437, 942) and मेदिनीरूपी  
- मेदिनी पृथिवी रूपं - स्वरूपं अस्य अस्तीति मेदिनीरूपी । ᳚यो  
वै रुद्रस्स भगवान् या च भूस्तस्मै नमो नमः᳚ इति श्रुतिः ॥  
SS(360). So, it is natural that we should hesitate to put our feet on  
Her. But we cannot avoid doing so also.  So we request Her to pardon  
our act. She being the embodiment of forbearance will, we may be sure,  
tolerate and allow it. The following verse is also in praise of Bhu Devi.  %begin shloka  
  
नमोऽस्तु प्रियदत्तायै तुभ्यं देवि वसुन्धरे ।

Meaning:- O Devi! I salute you and beg your pardon for having to set  
foot on your body for my routine activities.  You are the giver of all  
that is dear to us. You are the mother and repository of all wealth.  
  
Notes:- Earth is called the mother as She bears all like a fond mother  
bearing her child in her lap. In addition She sustains all living beings  
by giving food items in many forms like grains, fruits etc., besides water  
in abundance.  These are most needed by all and so dear to us. वसुः  
= wealth, riches. The mother who gave birth to us may not be with us till  
our end and look after us, but may leave us any day before it. But the  
mother Earth bears and sustains us all through our life. Further, we may,  
without being aware of Her greatness, treat Her lightly.  She bears all  
the abuses patiently and so is the very embodiment of patience. Narada  
describes Rama as the counterpart of Mother Earth in forbearance. क्षमया  
पृथिवीसमः । Ramayana (1-1-18).  The question is, how the earth  
which itself is suspended in space is able to bear all beings and also  
make plants grow? The Lord says that it is He who is behind the earth  
and provides the necessary support. BG((15-13).  %begin shloka

Notes:- It was pointed out earlier that every thing in the universe that  
has a name or form is His manifestation only. Because of this reason,  
He is known as बहुरूपः - ब्रह्मादि स्थावरान्तकारेण बहुरूपः ।   
SS(393). Every object right from Brahma - the creator to a plant is His  
form only. The Kaivalyopanishad says that He is Brahma, Shiva, Indra,  
the immovable, the supreme, the Self luminous.  He is Vishnu, Prana,  
the Time, the Fire and the Moon.  %begin shloka

The famous hymn Siva Mahimna Stotram (26) says that those people who  
consider themselves to be wise hold the opinion that the Lord is the  
Sun, the Moon, the Fire, the Air, the Water, the Space, the Earth and  
the Self. But all these  opinions are only limiting the Lord. The poet  
exclaims that one does not know His real nature as He is all pervading.  %begin shloka

Hindu Prosody); the Seven Svaras (tones) (i.e. Shadja, Rsabha, Gandhara,  
Madhyam, Panchama, Dhaivata and Nisada); and the seven nether-worlds  
(Atala, Vitala, Sutala, Talatala, Rasatala, Mahatala and Patala) ---may  
all these make the morning auspicious for me !  
  
Notes:- The four sages Sanatkumara etc., are said to be born of the mind  
of Brahma in the very beginnig of creation.  They were not interested  
in taking to the life of a householder.So, they took to a life of  
renunciation. They were great devotees and jnanis. They, being the  
first born, are senior to all, but they remain ever youthful. They  
move around the worlds unhindered teaching people about devotion  
and wisdom. Being great devotees they keep uttering the name of  
the Lord. हरिः शरणमेवं हि नित्यं तेषां मुखे वचः ।  
(Sri Bhagavata mahatmyam.(2-48). We know that sage Narada was the  
guru of great devotees like Prahlada, Dhruva and sages like Vyasa and  
Valmiki. But, it seems, that the great Narada himself felt unhappy  
and missing a feeling of fulfilment. He approached Sanatkumara who  
taught him the famous Bhuma Vidya. It is said Sanatkumara is the  
incarnation of Lord Skanda. तँ स्कन्द इत्याचक्षते तँ स्कन्द

(mentioned in an earlier verse) was born to him. He was the embodiment  
of nectar. Brahma appointed him as the chief of brahmins, herbs,  
plants and of the stars. विप्रौषध्युडुगणानां ब्रह्मणा कल्पितः  
पतिः ।BH(9-14-3).  This verse mentions the higher worlds (above our  
world). The world we reside in is the Bhu loka (भूः).  The previous  
verse mentioned the seven nether worlds (below ouworld). One reaches  
these worlds as a result of his deeds. By doing more of good than evil  
acts one earns more merit or punyam and goes to the higher worlds.  
Similarly by indulging in prohibited acts , one earns papam and goes to  
the nether regions.BG(15-18).  %begin shloka

are the birth place of many rivers. They also have many holy places  
located in them. Great rivers like the Ganga, Sindhu are born in the  
Himalaya mountain. Holy places like Amarnath, Badrinath, Kedarnath,  
Rishikesh and mount Kailas - the abode of Lord Siva, are located in  
the Himalaya mountain. So it very holy and is देवतात्मा. Kalidasa  
uses the term in the opening verse in his classic Kumarasambhava to  
describe the Himalaya. अस्त्युत्तरस्यां दिशि देवतात्मा हिमालयो नाम  
नगाधिराजः । He describes the glory of the Himalaya in several verses  
that follow the opening verse.  Similarly the Vindhyachala is reputed to  
be the abode of Devi Lalitha. She has the name विन्ध्याचलनिवासिनी -

Meaning:-Raja Nala, the truthful Yudhisthira, Janaka the king of Videha,  
and Janardana (i. e.) Lord Krishna -the very utterance of these names  
sanctifies the tongue.  
  
Notes:- In this and the preceeding verses the names of several great seers  
and kings are mentined. Some of them, like king Nala, Harischandra and  
Rama had gone through severe ordeals. But they  did not get despondent  
and swerve from the path of righteousness. For example,  when Rama was  
told that he would not be made the king but will have to go to the forest  
his countenance did not show any change, nor was he upset.  %begin shloka

Ramayana. (2-19-23). These men  were great, because they did not act  
according to their own likes and dislikes. But they did what they thought  
was proper. Such an act may produce results that are not pleasant but  
they were willing to accept it as God's gift. What is proper and not  
is given in the shastras.What the shastras say is dharma. The shastras  
are given out by the Lord. The Lord's words are supreme and are to be  
followed implicitly without consideration of the results. The Lord had  
said the above clearly. BG(2-47).  %begin shloka  
  
कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन ।  
मा कर्मफलहेतुर्भू-र्मा ते सङ्गोऽस्त्वकर्मणि ॥  
These great men were confident that dharma will protect them and were  
convinced that one should not stray from the path of dharma under any  
circumstance. They surrendered to the God's will as expressed in the  
shastras. It is said in Mahabharata that dharma is eternal and so one  
should never give that up . On the other hand, joy and sorrow are not  
lasting. So, one should not give up dharma under any circumstance:    
from desire, fear, greed or even for the sake of one's life.  %begin shloka

Such people, Krishna says are wise (jnanis) and are qualified  to attain  
immortality (mokSha)  BG(2-15).  %begin shloka  
  
  
यं हि न व्यथयन्त्येते पुरुषं पुरुषर्षभ ।

The kings are known as rajarshis or royal sages.  Thus, Valmiki calls king  
Dasaratha as महर्षिकल्पो राजर्षिः । (1-6-20) rajarshi, as great as  
a maharshi.  So, showing respect to such persons is equivalent to showing  
respect to God. Even uttering their names  is as good as uttering the  
names of God and so is purifying as was seen earlier. Because of this  
reason, we will see that our puranas give in some places a long list of  
names of kings who were royal sages in the solar or lunar dynasty. The  
Brihadaranyopanishat gives a list of names of gurus who were jnanis and  
transmitted their knowledge to their desciples.  
  
Further, our scriptures say that those who praise, serve and worship  
the wise person (jnani) get the results of the meritorious actions  
(punyam) done by the wise man. Those who criticise, hate or cause  pain  
to the jnani get the results of sinful actions (papam) done by the wise  
man. (Tattva Bodha).  %begin shloka

In view of this, we, by mentioning the names of the great people listed  
in the above verses with reverence, stand to gain much because we will  
get a share of the punyam from their account.  
  
As an aside we may take a scene in Ramayana - the one wherein the  
queen Kausalya, mother of Rama blesses Rama before he departs to  
the forest. This is narrated in canto 25 of the Ayodhya Kanda. In  
her blessings she prays that  the seven rishis, Indra and the gods  
subordinate to him, the seasons, the moon god, Brihaspati, the seven  
principal mountains, the oceans etc., should protect Rama. Some verses  
forming the prayer are given below.  चकार माता रामस्य मङ्गलानि  
मनस्विनी ॥ १॥ The high minded mother Kausalya performed the rites  
conducive to the welfare of Rama (and said as follows).  %begin shloka

Kausalya prays to many divine beings and many other things (animate  
and inanimate) to protect Rama when he is in the forest. Those whom  
she prays to in the above verses include the following: the Sadhyas and  
the Viswedevas (two different classes of gods), the wind-gods, eminent  
rishis, the Cosmic Person, the creator, gods Pusha, Bhaga, Aryama,  
the guardians of the spheres headed by Indra, the deities presiding  
over the six seasons, the months, years, nights, days, and hours,  
the Vedas, the smriti texts, dharma, Lord Skanda, the moon god, sage  
Brihaspati, the seven rishis, sage Narada, siddhas, the four quarters  
along with their guardians, the seven principal mountains, the oceans,  
Varuna the king of the oceans, heaven, earth, the intervening region,  
the atmosphere, the animate and inanimate creation, the stars, the sun,  
planets along with their gods, deities presiding over the day and night,  
morning and evening twilights, deities presiding over the six seasons,  
the intercalary months and the years containing such months, divisions of  
time such as minutes and seconds, the rishis, the seven oceans, Dwipas  
(principal divisions of the globe), the four Vedas, the three spheres  
and the four quarters also.  What can be Kausalya's idea in praying to  
so many beings as listed above? If we read the above carefully we may  
notice that this prayer, sounds similar to the prayer contained in the  
Pratasmaranam.  Evidently  Kausalya was aware of the fact that God is  
present everywhere and in every thing. The sage Valmiki carefully uses  
the adjective मनस्विनी meaning ᳚wise᳚  or jnani to describe her  
in the first verse above. She knew the fact not only in theory but also  
from experience. This implies that she knew that Rama, while in forest,  
will always be surrounded by the Lord in one form or the other and so she  
prayed to such an omnipresent Lord to offer him protection. The prayer  
may be diferent but when we look at it from the right perspective appears  
sensible as emanating from a pious person.  %begin shloka

Meaning:- Any one who reads, remembers or hears this superior and  
purifying Pratasmaranam early in the morning every day, in that  
manner, will, by God's grace, have an auspecious day and be free from  
disturbing dreams.  Notes: This verse states the fruits of reciting  
or hearing the Pratasmaranam. फलम्  means fruit.  The stotram is  
said to be superior and purifying because it talks about the glory of  
the Lord.  It gives the benefits stated when it is read or heard with  
proper understanding of the meaning. So, it is said तद्वत् (i.e)  
in the proper manner.  Bad dreams are the results of latent tendencies,  
known as vasanas. Thinking of the Lord destroys these latent tendencies  
and the bad dreams that come up from them. So, the Lord has the name  
दुःस्वप्ननाशनः - भाविनोऽनर्थस्य सूचकान् दुःस्वप्नान् नाशयति  
ध्यातः, स्मृतः, कीर्तितः, पूजितश्चेति दुःस्वप्ननाशनः ।  
VS(926).  The verses in the Pratasmaranam help to keep alive the thought  
of the Lord all through the day and as a result there is no place for  
vasanas to hide in the mind and disturb our peace.
