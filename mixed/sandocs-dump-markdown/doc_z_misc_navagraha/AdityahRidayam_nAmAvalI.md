 आदित्यहृदयम् नामावली   
  
Commentary with Namavali :  by N.Balasubramanian bbalu at satyam.net.in  
INTRODUCTION  
Aditya Hridayam is a popular hymn. It appears in the Yuddhakandam in Valmiki's  
Ramayana. It is a prayer to Aditya. One meaning of `Aditya` is the sun. But,  
in this hymn `Aditya` is to be taken to signify the Supreme Being. `Hridayam`  
is known to mean the heart; but it also means secret. The prayer holds in  
itself the secret teachings of the upanishads about the Supreme Being. The  
various names of the Lord mentioned in the hymn are of great significance  
and so justify the name `hridayam`.  Given below are the 138 names of the  
Lord नामावलिः culled from the hymn.  They come handy for those who  
want to do prostrations to the Lord while uttering each name and those who  
want to do puja to the Lord. Those who want to do puja may invoke the Lord  
in a design (rangoli) or a picture or in a pot of water and perform archana  
after reciting each name. They are also suitable for reciting by those who,  
for some reason are not able to do any of the above or recite the hymn in full.  
  
(The following abbreviations are used in the comments given below. VS -  
Vishnu Sahasranamam with the commentary of Shri Sankaracharya. LS - Lalitha  
Sahasranamam)  
  
The Aditya Hridayam, as we all know, was taught by the sage Agastya to  
Shri Rama in the battle field. The battle with Ravana was fierce and  
long-drawn. Rama was tired and concerned at the fact that the end was not  
in sight.  At that time the sage appeared on the scene and taught Aditya  
Hridayam. He advised Shri Rama to worship Surya and repeat the verses three  
times. He said that by doing so the Lord will be pleased wirth his devotion  
and ensure victory in the battle  
  
        पूजयस्वैनमेकाग्रो देवदेवं जगत्पतिम् ।  एतत् त्रिगुणितं जप्त्वा  
        युद्धेषु विजयिष्यसि ।   
  
Before proceeding further, some questions may arise in the minds of the  
reader who has some familiarity with this hymn.  
  
1 - Who is Aditya? Is He the same as the sun we see rising and setting daily  
or some one different?  
  
2 - Why does the sage ask Shri Rama to recite the prayer three times?  
  
3 - And lastly, we know that Shri Rama was an avatar or incarnation of the  
Supreme Being. This being so, why should He be asked to pray to some one?  
  
The answer to these questions require some explanation. They are given below.  
  
THE LORD'S MANIFESTATIONS.   
  
The upanishads say that  the Supreme Being or the Lord (will be called as  
He here) is without any attributes including form.. But He manifests Himself  
in three forms for the benefit of His devotees.  
  
1 - In the gross form  स्थूल रूपेण .   
  
The eyes cannot see Him, because He is the power behind the eyes.  So, the  
kindly Lord makes Himself visible in the form of Aditya or the sun. Shri  
Rudram (7th and 8th Rik) says this.   
  
        असौ यस्ताम्रो अरुण उत बभ्रुः सुमङ्गलः ।  
        असौ योऽवसर्पति नीलग्रीवो विलोहितः।   
        उतैनं गोपा अदृशन्नदृशन्नुदहार्यः ।  
        उतैनं विश्वाभूतानि स दृष्टो मृडयाति नः॥   
  
This Sun who is copper colored when he rises, then slightly rosy-red, then  
golden-yellow, this highly auspicious and beneficient one is verily Rudra. The  
Lord Rudra with the blue throat who has assumed the form of the sun glows  
red while rising.  Him the cowherds behold and so the women carrying water;  
nay all the creatures. He who is thus beheld by all; may He bless us with  
happiness.  Since He resides in the skies He is known as विहायसगतिः -  
विहायसं गतिः आश्रयोऽस्येति विहायसगतिः।  (VS 876).  
  
The sun provides the world with warmth, light, rain etc. They give life to all  
in this planet and also sustain life.  So, the sun has the functions of Brahma  
the creator, Narayana the sustainer and Sankara the destroyer rolled into one.  
  
The following prayer recited during Sandhyavandanam says all this.   
  
        नमः सवित्रे जगदेक चक्षुषे जगत् प्रसूति स्थितिनाश हेतवे।  
        विरिञ्चि नारायण शङ्करात्मने।   
  
2 - In the subtle form सूक्ष्म रूपेण    
  
He is the inner being who bleses the sun and gives him his radiance. This  
is said in many places in the scriptural texts. Some such cases are cited  
here for reference.    
  
        आदित्यः - आदित्यमण्डलान्तःस्थो हिरण्मयः पुरुषः आदित्यः; यथादित्य एक  
        एवानेकेषु जलभाजनेषु अनेकवत् प्रतिभासते एवमनेकेषु शरीरेषु एक  
        एवात्मानेकवत् प्रतिभासत इति आदित्यसाध्र्म्याद्वा आदित्यः। VS (39).    
  
He is the Golden-hued Being resident in the solar disc. Or, just as one sun appears as many in many vessels containing water, so also the same Atma appears as many in many bodies. So, He is known as Aditya.    
  
ज्योतिरादित्यः - ज्योतिषि सवितृमण्डले स्थितो ज्योतिरादित्यः।  VS (564).    
  
He resides in the sun.   
  
        भानुमण्डलमध्यस्था - भानुमण्डलस्य सूर्यमण्डलस्य मध्ये तिष्ठतीति तथा।   
        सन्ध्यासमये देव्यास्तत्र ध्येयत्वात्। LS (275).   
  
She resides in the solar disc. She is to be meditated upon during the evening prayers.  
  
We meditate on Narayana who resides in the sun with the following prayer recited during our Sandhyavandanam.   
  
        ध्येयः सदा सवितृमण्डल-मध्यवर्ती नारायण  
        सरसिजासन-सन्निविष्टः।  केयूरवन् मकर-कुण्डलवान् किरीटी  
        हारी हिरण्मयवपुः धृत-शङ्खचक्रः॥   
  
Similarly we are advised to meditate upon Lord Siva along with Amba in the sun and get relieved from the cyclic births.   
  
        सौरमण्डल मध्यस्थं साम्बं संसारभेषजम्।  
        नीलग्रीवं विरूपाक्षं नमामि शिवमव्ययम्॥   
  
The Mundaka Upanishad makes a more detailed narration. (II-I-9 and 10).  तच्छुभ्रं ज्योतिषां ज्योतिस्तद्यदात्मविदो विदुः।  It is pure, and is the Light of lights which the knowers of the Self realise.  तमेव भान्तमनुभाति सर्वं तस्य भासा सर्वमिदं विभाति।  Everything shines according as He does so: by His light all this shines diversely. Shri Sankarchrya explaines in his commentary that the Supreme Being is naturally effulgent. All this - the universe constituted by sun etc., shines diversely. It is that very Brahman that illuminates and shines through the different manifested lights.  Shri Krishna says this specifically in His Bhagavad Gita. (15-12). He says that the light that resides in the sun and illuminates the whole world, that which is seen in the moon and fire are all His only.   
  
        यदादित्यगतं तेजो जगद्भासयतेऽखिलम्।  यच्चन्द्रमसि  
        यच्चग्नौ तत्तेजो विद्धि मामकम्॥   
  
3 - In the causal form कारण रूपेण    
  
as the Self residng in the heart of all beings.  He is known as   
  
        भूतात्मा - भूतानामात्मा अन्तर्यामीति भूतात्मा ।  
        एष त आत्मान्तर्याम्यमृतः  
              (बृ-उ ७.३-२२) इति श्रुतेः।  VS(8).   
                
        सर्वान्तर्यामिणी - सर्वेषामन्तःकरणनियामक इति ।  
        एष त आत्मान्तर्याम्यमृत॒ इत्यन्तर्यामिब्राह्मणात्।  LS(818).  
  
Shri Krishna says this clearly in the Gita. BG (10-20). He says that He is the Self residing in the heart of all beings.  He is the beginning, the middle and also the end.   
  
        अहमात्मा गुडाकेश सर्वभूताशयस्थितः।  अहमादिश्च मध्यं  
        च भूतानामन्त एव च॥   
  
The worship of Surya by chanting the verses thrice implies the worship of the Supreme Being in all the three forms - in the gross form as the Sun, the worship of Supreme Being in the  subtle form as the power behind the Sun and, in the causal form as the sentience resident in the heart of all beings as explained above. We may find in the list of names (namavali) that follows names that support the above explanation.  
  
After teaching the Aditya Hridayam the sage left the place and joined the gods (devas) who have assembled in the sky above the battle field to witness the war between Shri Rama and Ravana.   
  
        अस्मिन् क्षणे महाबाहो रावणं त्वं वधिष्यसि।  एवमुक्त्वा तदागस्त्यो  
        जगाम च यथागतम्॥   
  
Earlier Shri Rama was concerned as to how he can win the battle with Ravana as the events were not going his way.  But on hearing the advice from the sage Agastya, he regained his confidence and became cheerful. He chanted the Aditya Hridayam stotram as advised by the sage and got ready to face Ravana.   
  
        रावणं प्रेक्ष्य हृष्टात्मा युद्धाय समुपागतम्।  सर्वयत्नेन महता  
        वधे तस्य धृतोऽभवत्॥   
  
Surya Bhagavan was pleased by Shri Rama chanting the Aditya Hridayam properly with devotion.  He came down from His region and joined the group of gods who have assembled in the sky above the battle field to watch the events. He encouraged Shri Rama to go ahead and fight Ravana. He was sure that Rama will  kill Ravana and emerge victorious in the war.   
  
        अथ रविरवदन्निरीक्ष्य रामं मुदितमनाः परमं प्रहृष्यमाणः।  
        निशिचरपतिसङ्क्षयं विदित्वा सुरगणमध्यगतो वचस्त्वरेति॥   
  
Now, we take up the question No. (3) mentioned earlier. That is, Shri Ramayana says that Shri Rama was an incarnation of Shri Narayana or the Supreme Being. We find in the Valmiki Ramayana (Yuddha Kanda - chapter 120) that after Shri Rama won the battle with Ravana, the gods including Brahma, Rudra and others approached Shri Rama, praised him and said that he is none other than the Supreme Being Narayana.   
  
        भवान् नारायणो देवः श्रीमान् चक्रायुधो विभुः।   
          
This being so, is it appropriate for Shri Rama to worship the Sun god? Does it not imply that the Sun god is superior even to Shri Rama who is not different from the Supreme Being?  The answer to this question is as follows.  The Sun god mentioned in this Aditya Hridayam is not the solar disc but the Supreme Being rsiding in the sun.  This is said in the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (3-7-9)   
  
        यः आदित्ये तिष्ठन् आदित्यादन्तरः, यमादित्यो न वेद,  
        यस्यादित्यः शरीरम्, य आदित्यमन्तरो यमयति, एष त  
        आत्मान्तर्याम्यमृतः॥   
          
He who inhabits the sun, but is within it, whom the sun does not know, whose body is the sun, and who controls the sun from within, is the Internal Ruler, your own immortal self. This was said earlier also.  
  
That the Surya Bhagavan referred to here is the supreme Being only is amply made clear as He is called herein (name no. 109) as the Lord of Brahma, Isha or Siva and  Achyuta or Vishnu ब्रह्मेशानाच्युतेशाय नमः।    
  
How can the sun be the Lord of the three gods mentioned here? So, one has to conclude that the Aditya is only the Supreme Being. Shri Rama took on the role of a human being just to teach us the way to live, not just to destroy the demons. मर्त्यावतार-स्त्विह मर्त्यशिक्षणं रक्षोवधायैव न केवलं विभोः। BH(5-19-5) He wanted to show that when one is confronted with a seemingly difficult situation that appears to defy solution, he can overcome it by resorting to God. Shri Krishna gave  Arjuna the same advice on the KurukShetra battle field. He told Arjuna that he will overcome all difficulties by fixing his mind on Him the Lord.  Shri Krishna added a warning that if Arjuna failed to heed His advice,  and, if from egotism he thought he can manage the affairs himself, he will then be doomed to fail.. BG(18-58).   
  
        मच्चित्तः सर्वदुर्गाणि मत्प्रसादात्तरिष्यसि।  अथ  
        चेत्त्वमहङ्कारान्न श्रोष्यसि विनङ्क्ष्यसि॥   
  
This, then, is the lesson we learn from Aditya Hridayam. To repeat, we should turn to Lord when confronted with problems that threaten to overwhelm us. Now, given below are  the names नामावलिः of Lord Surya.
