 बृहत् पाराशर होरा शास्त्र ३४-४५  
  
  English translation  
From Aswi is supposed to be derived carriages for animals for transport,  
everything related to transport and transport department. The Puranas  
relate that the two Aswini Kumaras were born of mother Sanga and father  
Ravi. The mother held the solar semen in her nostrils, for otherwise  
she could not hold it, it is so strong. They are the twins of Sanga and  
therefore this NakShatra is supposed to produce twins, Mangal in this  
NakShatra - specially if the Lagna is in Kumbha and Mangal in bhatristhan  
indicates twin brother and sister for the native. Or if Ravi, Guru or  
Pitri Karaka or lord of the Bhava signifying father or son in a similar  
way is in this NakShatra then the father or any of the uncles or any of  
the children may be one of the twin. Hasta NakShatra: Spread from 10:    
to 23:20' Kanya. Deity Surya, Lord Budha, symbol - closed hand. The 12  
names of the sun are: (1) Arun, (2) Aditya, (3) Tapan, (4) Divakar, (5)  
Bhaskar, (6) Bhanu, (7) Martanda, (8) Mihir, (9) Ravi, (10) Bivakar,  
(11) Sahasramsu and (12) Surya. All the attributes of these names  
etymologically connotes are caused by this star. From the Surya we  
derive creativity and creation, and from creation we derive light,  
lustre, and strength. Surya is the prime cause of dominion, kingship,  
power of immunity and the light that dispels darkness. Budha is the cause  
of knowledge. If placed in this star he sheds light all around. Ravi  
with this NakShatra enhances the instinct of dominion and the capacity  
to rule over others. It brushes up human intelligence, making it more  
luminous and makes a man vibrant with life and light. The symbol is a  
closed hand or fist. It would follow that is signifies determination and  
clenched resolution. To keep everybody within one's grip, the possessive  
instinct follows from the nature of this star. The magician and the  
pick-pocket are also born under this star - variation from nobler  
attributes. Anthropomorphically it is the hand of Kalapurush. Bharani  
NakShatra: Devata Yama; birth star of Rahu. It extends from 13:20  
t o 26:40. Symbol: Orifice of the womb (oss-mouth), lord Mangal. It  
is possible to hav e an idea of the nature of Bharani NakShatra from  
the nature of Rahu, Mangal and Yama. To take Rahu first, 1. Rahu gives  
extravagant enjoyment of material pleasure and is later on the cause of  
sorrow, 2. Mangal gives courage, strength, exaltation and hope, 3. Yama  
purity, cleanliness, justice and integrity. The sense of restraint is also  
Yamas gift; he is the lord of Dharma, a stern disciplinarian, a ruthless  
expositor of truth, and a refuge for kings and law-abiding subjects. We  
should not always confine his interpretation to his being only the lord  
of death; he is the great judicature, the ultimate dispenser of reward  
and punishment. The story of Yama-Nachiketa is a particularly exposition  
of the hospitality of Yama, his sense of dharma and knowledge of it,  
his superb honesty and great integrity and other divine virtues. The  
NakShatra of which he is the devata (God) is also in consequence the  
giver of whatever is good, pure, truthful and honest. The etymological  
meaning of Bharani is what deserves to be cultivated and preserved  
that is dependence, servitors, retainers or anything by which living  
is earned, for example salary. Krithika NakShatra: This is the birth  
star of Chandra. Many constellations gather at the tail end of Krithika  
group. It extends from Mesa 26:40. The residuary 10: degree fall in  
Vrishabha. The Devata is Agni, Lord (Adhipati) is Mangal and Sukar. Agni  
is the great purifier, the great consumer of and the giver of light,  
heat and brightness. Agni causes the fire of life and the drive. It is  
also the spark of life. Without fire creation would not exist. Agni  
is at the base of creation and of the continuation of existence. It  
consumes everything. The fire of digestion in the human system and the  
external fire for cooking are only different manifestation of the same  
principle which is Agni. Agni is the symbol of brightness and brilliance,  
all weapons with fire-power. And other things of the same category come  
within the range of Krithika group. The fire is considered as purifier;  
for it burns away all that is wicked, dark and dull, also all that is low  
and sinful and inauspicious in the world. The dross thus blazed away,  
only effulgence and light remain. Fire gives the earth its activity  
and dynamic and revives it after the spells of cold that periodically  
inflict comatose condition of the earth. It is easy enough to deduce  
from fire the causal effect of the Krithika group. Mangal is the lord  
of that part of Krithika which is in Mesa Rashi and Mangal is like  
a mass of lightning in shining splendour. So, the Krithika in Mesa  
is devastatingly brilliant, the effulgence being closely associated  
with also an incendiary character. The Krithika of Vrishabha Rashi is  
brilliant but unlike the Krithika of Mesa, not incendiary. The lord  
of Vrishabha Rashi is brilliant but unlike the Krithika of Mesa, not  
incendiary. The Lord of Vrishabha Rashi is Sukra and Sukra stands for  
worship of beauty and for poetry and imagination. He is radiantly white  
like snow, the Kunda flower and the Utpal. He is also the encyclopedic  
expounder of all branches of learning. It follows that the Krithika of  
Vrishabha is brilliant but the brilliance does not burn, it is soft and  
sweet, and benign.The Krithika of Mesa Rashi is doubtless brilliant,  
it has plenty of heat which burns. The Krithika of Vrishabha has on  
the contrary a softened radiance, a wave of brightness that does not  
hurt. Anuradha NakShatra: Spread from 3:20' to 16᳚40' Vrscika Rashi. Lord  
is Mang al, Symbol - the same as that of Visakha. Visakha and Anuradha  
are complimentary to each other. From Anuradha is derived friendship,  
love, affection and other tender feature of a person's character. From  
Visakha is considered the ultimate objective while from Anuradha is  
indicated the action. The difference between Visakha and Anuradha  
is that while the Visakha-native forgets after success about benefits  
derived as also the persons who helped, the Anuradha-native retains soft  
feeling about them, he keeps his friendship intact and does not forget  
the benefits. The Anuradha-native's mind is always alive and receptive  
to all feelings and gestures of friendship and love. He is like the  
sentinel always a mounting guard over emotions, but lacking the hardness  
or toughness of the official sentinel. Rohini NakShatra: The word is  
derived from Rohan which means to rise or to bring into existence. It  
extends in the Vrishabha Rashi from 10 degree to 23:20. The lord of it is  
Sukra, the symbol a Cart drawn by Cows. The Devata is Brahma, the prime  
creator of all things living, from the meanest insect to Man, the beauty  
of the weird, the paragon of animals. Rohini- group therefore encompasses  
everything that comes within the range of creation--beasts, birds,  
animals etc. It would also connote the process of growing, begetting,  
birth, production etc, in brief production, birth and creation. Rising  
means process of ascending, that is to say the creative evolution, the  
cultivation and the improvement. Mythology describes Rohini the wife of  
Chandra. Of all the 27 Stars-all wives of Chandra-Rohini is said to have  
been fond of fine dress, cosmetics and decore and was the most beloved  
of Chandra. The Rohini (group) is, in the line with this, considered to  
be the cause of a taste for fine dress, perfume, and other articles of  
toilet. Creation continues to exist mainly on the basis of food; and  
Rohini is supposed to be the cause of food. The direct and immediate  
cause of food is Agni and Brahma the remote cause. From this point of  
view the God who gives food, that is Agni, is the spiritual principle of  
Rohini (group) NakShatra and because, Brahma the remote cause of food is  
also the Devata of Rohini; the range of influences of this group runs  
over the whole gamut of the visible and invisible animal world. Swati  
NakShatra: Spread from 6:40' to 20: Tula. Lord is Sukra, the deity is  
the Wind and because of this latter factor this causes the attributes  
of the Wind. Restlessness of disposition or physical restlessness,  
inability to stay still at any place comes from it; also fidgetiness  
and noise. It is self-assured and asserting. The winds (Murut) are the  
Lords of North-West. The 49 of them under the Paban, of all Gods he is  
the strongest and most obstinate. From these are derived the knowledge,  
the physical internal adjustments of the 5 Winds - Pan, Apan, Vyan,  
Udan and Saman. Also from this comes the storms and the whirl-wind,  
the concrete disturbance of the atmosphere, A person born under this  
star is good at buying and selling, his wealth and property come and go  
quite easily. He is an independent sort of man, always striving for more  
independence. Asceticism is yet another attribute of this star. diseases  
of the wind are to be treated in reference to this . The Wind is the great  
scavenger, it sweats the dross and purifies. The winowing of rice bears  
comparison to this. Mrigasira NakShatra: Mrigasira NakShatra extends from  
after 23:20 in Vrishabha Rashi up to 6:40 in Mithune. Presiding deity  
Chandra. Symbol-Antilope or Deer. The word Mriga represents forests,  
gardens, a search, a seeking to find, to roam about in the forests  
and a hunter, to seek, to blaze the trail, a guide and preceptor. An  
erotic affair, beauty of the countenance with particular emphasis on  
the radiant lustre of the face, because of Chandra. To seek as the  
primary characteristic of the star, to discover hidden treasures after  
the churning of the Sea, the Samudra Manthan of the Hindu Mythology,  
the mother, motherly conduct that is to say maternal instincts,  
self-sacrifice without hope of requital etc. Chandra is the lord of the  
mind, so all mental attitude, good or bad, sympathies and antipathies,  
patience and impatience, the fidgetiness and placidity, imagination,  
the gift of poetry, purity, sweetness and light, physical and mental  
aspects, all these come within this star and when things of sweetness  
and light of physic as also of the mind, both derivatives from Chandra,  
the horoscope of Rabindra Nath comes to mind. His Janma Lagna was Meen  
with Chandra there and Guru was in Karkata Rashi. Because of this yoga  
Rabindra Nath had something like physical translucence which was object  
of admiration all the world over, wherever people met. Also, at the same  
time his poetry enthralled the whole world. Chandra is a sub-Graha around  
the earth and that is why the influence of Chandra on all that happens  
in the earth is so paramount. And again that is why the influence of  
Chandra on both the body and mind is simultaneously so very great. Sukra  
and Chandra both are female grahas (planets) with difference that while  
Chandra is the Lord of motherhood, maternal instincts and all that,  
Sukra is the lord of feminine beauty, the structure of feminine form,  
the physical excellence of women and all that. In the former there is  
elegance and dignity of the feminine while in the latter, the physical  
beauty and the lure of feminine form which leads a male captive  
dominates. Chandra is the lord of marine products and of medicines;  
that it was from the sea that Chandra rose. And it is to Chandra that  
the influences and causalities have to be traced. Mrigasira NakShatra:    
Mrigasira NakShatra extends from after 23:20 in Vrishabha Rashi up to  
6:40 in Mithune. Presiding deity Chandra. Symbol-Antilope or Deer. The  
word Mriga represents forests, gardens, a search, a seeking to find,  
to roam about in the forests and a hunter, to seek, to blaze the trail,  
a guide and preceptor. An erotic affair, beauty of the countenance  
with particular emphasis on the radiant lustre of the face, because of

hidden treasures after the churning of the Sea, the Samudra Manthan of  
the Hindu Mythology, the mother, motherly conduct that is to say maternal  
instincts, self-sacrifice without hope of requital etc. Chandra is the  
lord of the mind, so all mental attitude, good or bad, sympathies and  
antipathies, patience and impatience, the fidgetiness and placidity,  
imagination, the gift of poetry, purity, sweetness and light, physical  
and mental aspects, all these come within this star and when things of  
sweetness and light of physic as also of the mind, both derivatives from  
Chandra, the horoscope of Rabindra Nath comes to mind. His Janma Lagna  
was Meen with Chandra there and Guru was in Karkata Rashi. Because of  
this yoga Rabindra Nath had something like physical translucence which  
was object of admiration all the world over, wherever people met. Also,  
at the same time his poetry enthralled the whole world. Chandra is a  
sub-Graha around the earth and that is why the influence of Chandra on  
all that happens in the earth is so paramount. And again that is why  
the influence of Chandra on both the body and mind is simultaneously  
so very great. Sukra and Chandra both are female grahas (planets)  
with difference that while Chandra is the Lord of motherhood, maternal  
instincts and all that, Sukra is the lord of feminine beauty, the  
structure of feminine form, the physical excellence of women and all  
that. In the former there is elegance and dignity of the feminine while  
in the latter, the physical beauty and the lure of feminine form which  
leads a male captive dominates. Chandra is the lord of marine products  
and of medicines; that it was from the sea that Chandra rose. And it is  
to Chandra that the influences and causalities have to be traced. Moola  
NakShatra: Spread from 0: to 13:20' Dhanu Rashi, Lord is Jupiter  
(Guru). Symbol - a bunch of roots tied together, deity 'Nirithi' or  
'AlakShmi'. It also means the 'opposite' or 'reverse'. Moola is not  
one of the good stars which is evident from this that the deity is  
AlakShmi i.e. God of ill luck. Moola signifies roots, that is to say,  
everything of basic nature, its motion is finite and limited. It does  
not go beyond its narrow orbit. Old servant, pedlar of seeds, physician  
administering herbal seed remedies - every such thing is determined  
from this star. The Moola native looks into scientific, literary,  
philosophic and other basic subjects. Mortgate and Mortgaged property are  
governed by this star and its horizon is not rural but urban. Uttarasarha  
NakShatra: Spread from 26:40' Dhanu to 10: of Makara. Lord is Guru and  
Sani. The derivatives from Uttarasarha are closely allied to those of  
Poorbasarha. The points of difference are as follows. Poorbasarha spreads  
out, it is concerned with extensiveness. Uttarasarha is introspective  
and penetrative and is concerned with intensiveness, the results of  
the latter being more permanent than the former (Poorbasarha). The  
deity who preserves this world and makes for its welfare is called  
ganadevata. There are ten ganadevatas Basu, Satya, Kratu, DakSha, Kala,  
Kama, Dhriti, Kuru, Pururaba, Madraba. All their attributes are in this  
star. The warrior, the wrestler, the painter, the artist, the magician,  
the well-dressed man, the happy and successful men are influenced by  
this star. A special characteristic of it is that it causes a person  
to be admired and socially applauded. Another characteristic of it is  
is that under the influence of this star the native falls in love with  
an unmarried girl. Vishma of the Mahabharata was one of the 8 Basus;  
so under this star one possesses self-control, restraint, endurance and  
firm character. There are special rituals for the worship of ganadevatas,  
which are more or less of specialised nature. The juice of Soma plant  
plays a part in yagna and worship.  
  
  
  
Chapter 34 Yoga Karakas 1. O Brahmin, thus I have told you about the  
effects derivable through Karakamsh. Now listen to the effects arising  
out of lordships of grahas over bhavas.  
  
2-7. Nature due to Lordships of Grahas: Benefics owning Kendras will  
not give benefic effects, while malefics owning Kendras will not remain  
inauspicious. The lord of a Kon will give auspicious results. The  
lord of Lagn is specially auspicious as Lagn is a Kendr as well as a  
Kon. Putr and Dharm Bhava are specially for wealth, while Yuvati and  
Karm Bhava are specially for happiness. Any grah owning Sahaj, Ari,  
or Labh Bhava will give evil effects. The effects due to the lords of  
Vyaya and Randhr Bhava will depend on their association. In each group,  
the significance will be in the ascending order. Randhr's lord is not  
auspicious as he owns the 12th from Dharm Bhava. If the lord of Randhr  
Bhava simultaneously owns Sahaj, Yuvati, or Labh Bhava, he will prove  
specifically harmful, while his simultaneous ownership of a Kon will  
bestow auspicious effects. The grah owning a predominant Bhava will stall  
the effects due to another owning a less significant bhava and will give  
his own results. Randhr's lordship of Surya and Chandr is not evil.  
  
8-10. Natural Benefics and Natural Malefics: Guru and Shukr are  
benefics, while Chandr is mediocre in benefice and Buddh is neutral  
(i.e. a benefic when associated with a benefic and a malefic when related  
to a malefic). Malefics are Surya, Shani, and Mangal. Full Chandr, Buddh,  
Guru and Shukr are stronger in the ascending order. Weak Chandr, Surya,  
Shani, and Mangal are stronger (in malefic disposition) in the ascending  
order. In revealing maleficence due to rulership of Kendras, Chandr,  
Buddh, Guru, and Shukr are significant in the ascending order.  
  
11-12. Lordships of Kendras and Konas: If there be an exchange between  
an lord of a Kendr and a lord of a Kon, or if a lord of a Kendr is yuti  
with a lord of a Kon in a Kendr or in a Kon, or if a lord of a Kon is in  
a Kendr or vice versa, or if there happens to be a full drishti between  
a lord of a Kendr and a lord of a Kon, they cause a Yog. One born in  
such a Yog will become a king and be famous.  
  
13. If one and the same grah gets the lordships of a Kon as well as a  
Kendr, or if a grah is in a Kendr or in a Kon, it will prove specially  
a Yog Karak.  
  
14. Lordship of Kendr: It has been said that a malefic owning a Kendr  
will become auspicious, which is true only when it simultaneously lords  
over a Kon and not by merely owning a Kendr.  
  
15. If the lords of a Kendr or a Kon own simultaneously an evil bhava. he  
(i.e. the lord of the Kendr or the lord of the Kon) does not cause a  
Raj Yog by mere relations stipulated (as per ch.  
  
34, slokas 11 and 12).  
  
16. Rahu and Ketu: Rahu and Ketu give predominantly the effects as due  
to their yuti with a bhava lord or as due to the bhava they occupy.  
  
17. If Rahu and Ketu are in Kendr receiving a drishti from or in  
association with the lord of a Kon, or if Rahu or Ketu happen to be in  
a Kendr receiving a drishti from or in association with the lord of a  
Kendr it will become Yog Karak.  
  
18. 0 Maharishi Parashar, please narrate according to the rashis rising  
as to which grah is a Yog Karak and which is inauspicious.  
  
19-22. Grahas and Mesh Lagn: O Brahmin, listen to these with  
examples. Even though Mangal is the lord of Randhr Bhava, he will  
be helpful to (other) auspicious grahas. Shani, Buddh, and Shukr are  
malefics. Auspicious are Guru and Surya. The mere yuti of Shani with  
Guru will not produce auspicious effects (although they own a Kon and  
a Kendr). If Guru is at the disposal of a malefic, he will surely give  
inauspicious results. Shukr is a direct (or independent) killer. Shani,  
etc., will also inflict death if associated with an adverse grah  
(i.e Shukr).  
  
23-24. Grahas and Vrishabh Lagn: Guru, Shukr, and Chandr are  
malefics. Shani and Surya are auspicious. Shani will cause Raj Yog. Buddh  
is somewhat inauspicious; the Guru group (Guru, Chandr, and Shukr),  
and Mangal will inflict death.  
  
25-26. Grahas and Mithun Lagn: Mangal, Guru, and Surya are malefics,  
while Shukr is the only auspicious grah. The yuti of Guru with Shani  
is similar to that for Mesh Lagn. Chandr is the prime killer, but it is  
dependant on her association.  
  
27-28. Grahas and Kark Lagn: Shukr and Buddh are malefics, Mangal, Guru,  
and Chandr are auspicious. Mangal is capable of conferring a full-fledged  
Yog and giving auspicious effects. Shani and Surya are killers and give  
effects according to their associations.  
  
29-30. Grahas and Simh Lagn: Buddh, Shukr, and Shani are  
malefics. Auspicious effects will be given by Mangal, Guru, and  
Surya. Guru's yuti with Shukr (though respectively Kon and Kendr lords)  
will not produce auspicious results. Shani and Chandr are killers who  
will give effects according to their associations.  
  
31-32. Grahas and Kanya Lagn: Mangal, Guru, and Chandr are malefics,  
while Buddh and Shukr are auspicious. Shukr's yuti with Buddh will  
produce Yog. Shukr is a killer as well. Surya's role will depend on  
his association.  
  
33-34. Grahas and Tula Lagn: Guru, Surya, and Mangal are  
malefics. Auspicious are Shani and Buddh. Chandr and Buddh will cause  
Raj Yog. Mangal is a killer. Guru and other malefics will also acquire  
a disposition to inflict death. Shukr is neutral.  
  
35-36. Grahas and Vrischik Lagn: Shukr, Buddh, and Shani are  
malefics. Guru and Chandr are auspicious. Surya as well as Chandr are  
Yog Karakas. Mangal is neutral. Shukr and other malefics acquire the  
quality of causing death.  
  
37-38. Grahas and Dhanu Lagn: Only Shukr is inauspicious. Mangal  
and Surya are auspicious. Surya and Buddh are capable of conferring a  
Yog. Shani is a killer, Guru is neutral. Shukr acquires killing powers.  
  
39-40. Grahas and Makar Lagn: Mangal, Guru, and Chandr are malefics,  
Shukr and Buddh are auspicious. Shani will not be a killer on his  
own. Mangal and other malefics will inflict death. Surya is neutral. Only  
Shukr is capable of causing a superior Yog.  
  
41-42. Grahas and Kumbh Lagn: Guru, Chandr, and Mangal are malefics,  
while Shukr and Shani are auspicious. Shukr is the only grah that causes  
Raj Yog. Guru, Surya, and Mangal are killers. Buddh gives meddling  
effects.  
  
43-44. Grahas and Meen Bhava: Shani, Shukr, Surya, and Buddh are  
malefics. Mangal and Chandr are auspicious. Mangal and Guru will  
cause a Yog. Though Mangal is a killer he will not kill the native  
(independently). Shani and Buddh are killers.  
  
45-46. General: Thus, the auspicious and inauspicious effects derivable  
through the grahas due to their lordship according to the rising rashi,  
have to be estimated. Apart, the effects due to Nabhash Yogas, etc.,  
should also be known which I narrate as under.  
  
  
  
Chapter 35 Nabhash Yogas 1-2.  O excellent of the Brahmins, explained  
below are 32 Nabhash Yogas which have a total of 1800 different  
varieties. These consist of 3 Asraya Yogas, 2 Dala Yogas, 20 Akriti Yogas,  
and 7 Sankhya Yogas.  
  
3-6. Names of Nabhash Yogas: The 3 Asraya Yogas are: Rajju, Musala,  
and Nala Yogas; The 2 Dala Yogas are: MAl and Sarpa; The 20 Akriti Yogas  
are: Gada, Sakat, Shringatak, Vihag, Hal, Vajr, Kamal, Vapi, Yup, Shar,  
Shakti, Danda, Nisk, Koot, Chatr, Dhanushi, (or Chap), Ardh, Chandr,  
Chakr, and Samudr Yogas; The 7 Sankhya Yogas are: Vallaki, DAm, PAsh,  
Kedara, Sool, Yuga, and Gola Yogas. Thus, these are 32 in total.  
  
7. Rajju, Musala, and Nala Yogas: All the grahas in movable rashis  
cause Rajju Yog. All the grahas in fixed rashis cause Musala Yog. All  
the grahas in dual rashis cause Nala Yog.  
  
8. MAl and Sarpa Yogas: If 3 Kendras are occupied by benefics MAl  
Yog is produced, (benefic results) while malefics so placed will cause  
Bhujang or Sarpa Yog. These Yogas respectively produce benefic and  
malefic results.  
  
9-11. Gada, Sakat, Vihag, Shringatak, Hal, Vajr, and Yav Yoga If all  
the grahas occupy two successive Kendras, Gada Yog is formed. Sakat Yog  
occurs when all the grahas are disposed in Lagn and Yuvati Bhava. If  
all confine to Bandhu and Karm Bhava, then Vihag Yog occurs. All grahas  
in Lagn, Putr and Dharm Bhava cause Shringatak Yog, while all grahas  
are in Dhan, Ari, and Karm Bhava, or in Sahaj, Yuvati, and Labh Bhava,  
or in Bandhu, Randhr, and Vyaya Bhava cause Hal Yog. Vajr Yog is caused  
by all benefics in Lagn and Yuvati Bhava, or all malefics in Bandhu and  
Karm Bhava. In a contrary situation, i.e. all benefics in Bandhu and  
Karm Bhava or all malefics in Lagn and Yuvati Bhava, Yav Yog is generated.  
  
12. Kamal and Vapi Yogas: If all the grahas are in the 4 Kendras, Kamal  
Yog is produced. If all of them happen to be in all the Apoklimas (cadent  
bhavas), or in all the Panapharas (succedent bhavas), Vapi Yog occurs.  
  
13. Yup, Shar, Shakti, and Danda Yogas: If all the 7 grahas are in the  
4 bhavas commencing from Lagn, they cause Yup Yog; if all the 7 grahas  
are in the 4 bhavas commencing from Bandhu Bhava Shar Yog occurs; if all  
the 7 grahas are in the 4 bhavas commencing from Yuvati Bhava Shakti Yog  
occurs; and if all the 7 grahas are in the 4 bhavas commencing from Karm  
Bhava Danda Yog is formed.  
  
14. Nauka, Koot, Chatr, and Chap Yogas: If all the grahas occupy the  
seven bhavas from Lagn Nauka Yog occurs; if all the grahas occupy  
the seven bhavas from Bandhu Bhava Koot Yog is formed; if all the  
grahas occupy the seven bhavas from Yuvati Bhava Chatr Yog occurs;  
and if all the seven grahas occupy the seven bhavas from Karm Bhava,  
Chap Yog occurs. Here again, the grahas should occupy seven continuous  
bhavas. Quoted from saravali: If the seven grahas occupy continuously  
seven bhavas commencing from a bhava which is not angular to the lagna,  
the yoga produced is known as Ardh Chandra yoga.  
  
15. Chakr and Samudr Yogas: If all the grahas occupy six alternative  
rashis commencing from Lagn, Chakr Yog is formed. Samudr Yog is produced  
if all grahas occupy six alternative rashis commencing from Dhan Bhava.  
  
16-17. Sankhya Yogas: If all grahas are in one Rashi Gola Yog is formed;  
if all grahas are in 2 rashis, Yuga Yog is formed; if all grahas are in 3  
rashis Sool Yog occurs; if all grahas are in 4 rashis Kedara Yog occurs;  
if all grahas are in 5 rashis PAsh Yogis formed, if all grahas are in  
6 rashis DAm Yog occurs; and if all grahas are in 7 rashis Veena Yog is  
produced. None of these seven Yogas will be operable, if another Nabhash  
Yog (explained earlier) is derivable.

Chapter 36 Many Other Yogas 1-2. Benefic and Malefic Yogas: If there be  
a benefic in Lagn, Subh Yog is produced, while a malefic in Lagn causes  
Asubh Yog. Benefics in both Vyaya and Dhan Bhava cause Subh Yog. Malefics  
in both Vyaya and Dhan Bhava cause Asubh Yog. One born in Subh Yog will be  
eloquent, charming, and virtuous, while his counterpart will be sensuous,  
will do sinful acts, and will enjoy (or swallow) others' wealth.  
  
3-4. Gaj Kesari Yog: Should Guru be in a Kendr from Lagn or from Chandr,  
and be yuti with or receiving a drishti from (another) benefic, avoiding  
at the same time debilitation, combustion, and inimical rashi, Gaj Kesari  
Yog is caused. One born in Gaj Kesari Yog will be splendorous, wealthy  
intelligent endowed with many laudable virtues and will please the king.  
  
5-6. Amal Yog: If there be exclusively a benefic in the 10th from Lagn  
or Chandr, Amal Yog exists. Amal Yog will confer fame lasting till Chandr  
and stars exist and will make the native honoured by the king, enjoy  
abundant pleasures, charitable, fond of relatives, helpful to others,  
pious, and virtuous.  
  
7-8. Parvat Yog: Benefics in Kendras will produce Parvat Yog, as Yuvati  
and Randhr Bhava are vacant or are occupied by only benefics. One born  
in Parvat Yog will be wealthy, eloquent, charitable, learned in Shastras,  
fond of mirth, famous, splendorous, and be the leader of a city.  
  
9-10. Kahal Yog: Should Bandhu's lord and Guru be in mutual Kendras,  
while Lagn's lord is strong, Kahal Yog occurs. Alternatively, Bandhu's  
lord being in his own or exaltation rashi should be yuti with Karm's  
lord. In effect, the native will be energetic, adventurous, charming,  
endowed with a complete army consisting of chariots elephants horses  
and infantry, and he will lord over a few villages.  
  
11-12. Chamar Yog: If Lagn's lord is exalted in a Kendr and receives  
a drishti from Guru, Chamar Yog is formed. This Yog also occurs if two  
benefics are in Lagn, or Dharm, or Karm, or Yuvati Bhava. The effects  
of Chamar Yog are: the native will be a king or honoured by the king,  
long lived, scholarly, eloquent, and versed in all arts.  
  
13-14. Shankh Yog: If Lagn's lord is strong, while the lords of Putr  
and Ari Bhava are in mutual Kendras, then, what is known as Shankh Yog  
is produced. Alternatively, if Lagn's lord along with Karm's lord is in a  
movable rashi, while Dharm's lord is strong, Shankh Yog is obtained. One  
born with Shankh Yog will be endowed with wealth, spouse and sons; he will  
be kindly disposed, propitious, intelligent, meritorious, and long lived.  
  
15-16. Bhairi Yog: If Vyaya, Tanu, Dhan, and Yuvati Bhava are occupied as  
Dharm's lord is strong, the native obtains Bhairi Yog. Again, another kind  
of Bhairi Yog is formed if Shukr, Guru, and Lagn's lord are in a Kendr,  
while Dharm's lord is strong. The results of Bhairi Yog are: the native  
will be endowed with wealth, wife and sons; he will be a king, be famous,  
virtuous, and endowed with good behaviour, happiness, and pleasures.  
  
17. Mridang Yog: If Lagn's lord is strong and others occupy Kendras,  
Konas, own bhavas or exaltation rashis, Mridang Yog is formed. The native  
concerned will be a king or equal to a king and be happy.  
  
18. Shrinath Yog: If Yuvati's lord is in Karm Bhava, while Karm's lord  
is exalted and yuti with Dharm's lord, Shrinath Yog takes place. The  
native with Shrinath Yog will be equal to lord Devendra (the god of gods).  
  
19-20. Sharad Yog: Should Karm's lord be in Putr Bhava, while Buddh is  
in a Kendr, as Surya with strength is in Simh, Sharad Yog is formed. This  
will again be obtained if Guru or Buddh is in a Kon to Chandr, while  
Mangal is in Labh Bhava. One born in either kind of Yog will obtain  
wealth, spouse and sons, be happy, scholarly, dear to the king, pious,  
and virtuous.  
  
21-22. Matsya Yog: Benefics in Dharm and Tanu Bhava, mixed grahas  
in Putr Bhava and malefics in Bandhu and Randhr Bhava: this array of  
grahas at birth will produce Matsya Yog. In effect, the native will be  
a Jyotishi, be a synonym of kindness, be virtuous, strong, beautiful,  
famous, learned, and pious.  
  
23-24. Kurm Yog: If Putr, Ari and Yuvati Bhava occupied by benefic grahas  
identical with own bhava, or exaltation, or friendly rashi, while malefics  
are in Sahaj, Labh, and Tanu Bhava, in own bhava or in exaltation, Kurm  
Yog is formed. The results of Kurm Yog are: the native will be a king. be  
courageous, virtuous, famous, helpful, happy; he will be a leader of men.  
  
25-26. Khadg Yog: Should there be an exchange of rashis between the  
lords of Dhan and Dharm Bhava, as Lagn's lord is in a Kendr or in a Kon  
Khadg Yog is obtained. One with Khadg Yog will be endowed with wealth,  
fortunes and happiness, be learned in Shastras, be intelligent, mighty,  
grateful, and skilful.  
  
27-28. LakShmi Yog: If Dharm's lord is in a Kendr identical with his  
Mooltrikon rashi, or own rashi, or in exaltation, while Lagn's lord is  
endowed with strength, LakShmi Yog occurs. The native with LakShmi Yog  
will be charming, virtuous, kingly in status, endowed with many sons  
and abundant wealth; he will be famous and of high moral merits.  
  
29-30. Kusum Yog: Shukr in a Kendr, Chandr in a Kon along with a benefic  
and Shani in Karm Bhava: these grahas thus cause Kusum Yog for one born  
in a fixed rashi ascending. Such a native will be a king or equal to him,  
be charitable, will enjoy pleasures, be happy, prime among his race men,  
virtuous and red-lettered.  
  
31-32. Kalanidhi Yog: If Guru is placed in Dhan, or Putr Bhava, and  
receives a drishti from Buddh and Shukr, Kalanidhi Yog is caused. In  
effect, the native will be virtuous, honoured by the kings, bereft of  
diseases, be happy, wealthy, and learned.  
  
33-34. Kalpa Drum Yog: Note the following four grahas: (a) Lagn's lord,  
(b) the dispositor of Lagn's lord, (c) the dispositor of the grah at b,  
(d) the Navamsh dispositor of the grah at c. If all these are disposed in  
Kendras and in Konas from Lagn, or are exalted, Kalpa Drum Yog exists. One  
with Kalpa Drum Yog will be endowed with all kinds of wealth, be a king,  
pious, strong, fond war, and merciful.  
  
35-36. Trimurthi Yogas: Counted from Dhan's lord, if benefics occupy  
the 2nd, 12th, and 8th, Hari Yog is formed. (The native will be happy,  
learned, and endowed with wealth and sons). If the 4th, 9th, and 8th  
with reference to the rashi occupied by Yuvati's lord are occupied by  
benefics, Hara Yog is obtainable. (The native will be happy, learned,  
and endowed with wealth and sons). Brahma Yog is generated if, counted  
from Lagn's lord, benefics are in the 4th, 10th, and 11th rashis. One  
born in anyone of the said three Yogas will be happy, learned, and  
endowed with wealth and sons.  
  
37. Lagn Adhi Yog: Should benefics be in Yuvati and Randhr Bhava counted  
from Lagn, and be devoid of yuti with, and/or drishti from malefics,  
Lagn Adhi Yog is produced making one a great person, learned in Shastras  
and happy.  
  
38-39. Effects of Lagn's Lord's Division Dignities: Lagn's lord in  
Parijatamsh will make one happy; Lagn's lord in Vargottama will give  
immunity to diseases; Lagn's lord in Gopuramsh will make one rich with  
wealth and grains; Lagn's lord in Simhasanamsh will make one a king;  
Lagn's lord in Paravatamsh will make one a scholar; Lagn's lord in  
Devalokamsh will make one opulent and endowed with conveyances; and Lagn's  
lord in Iravatamsh will make one famous and honoured by kings. (Vargottama  
indicates a grah occupying the same Rashi and the same Navamsh).  
  
  
  
Chapter 37 Chandr's Yogas 1. If Chandr with reference to Surya is in a  
Kendr, one's wealth, intelligence and skill will be little. If Chandr  
with reference to Surya is in a Panaphara, one's wealth, intelligence  
and skill will be meddling. If Chandr with reference to Surya is in a  
Apoklima, one's wealth, intelligence and skill will be excellent.  
  
2-4. In the case of a day birth, if Chandr placed in its own Navamsh,  
or in a friendly Navamsh, receives a drishti from Guru, one will be  
endowed with wealth, and happiness. One born at night time will enjoy  
similar effects if Chandr is in its own Navamsh, or in a friendly Navamsh  
receiving a drishti to Shukr. In a contrary situation, the drishti  
from Guru, or from Shukr on Chandr will make one go with little wealth,  
or even without that.  
  
5. Adhi Yog from Chandr: If benefics occupy the 8th, 6th, and 7th  
counted from Chandr, Adhi Yog obtains. According to the strength of  
the participating grahas, the native concerned will be either a king,  
or a minister, or an army chief.  
  
6. Dhan Yog: Should all the (three) benefics be Upachaya, i.e. in the  
3rd, the 6th, the 10th, and the 11th counted from Chandr, one will be  
very affluent; with two benefics placed in the 3rd, the 6th, the 10th,  
and the 11th one will have medium effects in regard to wealth. If a  
single benefic is there, the wealth will be negligible.  
  
7-10. Sunaph, Anaph, and Duradhar: If there is a grah, other than  
Surya, in the 2nd from Chandr Sunaph Yog is formed; if there is a grah,  
other than Surya, in the 12th from Chandr Anaph Yog is formed; and if  
there are grahas, other than Surya, in the 2nd from Chandr and in the  
12th from Chandr Duradhar Yog is caused. One with Sunaph Yog will be  
a king or equal to a king endowed with intelligence, wealth, fame, and  
self earned wealth. One born in Anaph Yog will be a king, be free from  
diseases, virtuous, famous, charming, and happy. One born in Duradhar Yog  
will enjoy pleasures; one will be charitable, and endowed with wealth,  
conveyances, and excellent serving force.  
  
11-13. Kema Drum Yog: Excluding Surya, should there be no grah with  
Chandr, or in the 2nd and/or 12th from Chandr, or in a Kendr from Lagn,  
Kema Drum Yog is formed. One born in Kema Drum Yog will be very much  
reproached; one will be bereft of intelligence; learning is reduced to  
penury and perils.  
  
  
  
Chapter 38 Surya's Yogas 1. Vesi, Vosi, and Abhayachari Yogas: Barring  
Chandr, if a grah among Mangal etc. be in the 2nd from Surya, Vesi Yog is  
formed; barring Chandr, if a grah among Mangal etc. be in the 12th from  
Surya, Vosi Yog is formed; and barring Chandr, if a grah among Mangal  
etc. be in both the 2nd and the 12th from Surya Ubhayachari Yog is caused.  
  
2-3. Effects of Vesi, Vosi, and Ubhayachari Yogas: One born in Vesi  
Yog will be even sighted, truthful, long bodied, indolent, happy, and  
endowed with negligible wealth. One born with Vosi Yog will be skilful,  
charitable, and endowed with fame, learning and strength. The Ubhayachari  
native will be a king or a equal to a king and be happy.  
  
4. Benefics causing Vesi, Vosi, or Ubhayachari Yogas will give the  
above mentioned effects, while malefics will produce contrary effects.  
  
  
  
Chapter 39 Raj Yog 1-2.  
  
0 excellent of the Brahmins, I now narrate below the Raj Yogas making  
one entitled to royal honour. These were told to Parvati by Lord Shiva  
once upon a time, the gist of which is as follows: 3-5. Raj Yogas are  
to be known from the Karakamsh Lagn and the natal Lagn. On the one hand  
the pair of Atma Karak and Putr Karak should be considered and on the  
other hand the natal Lagn's lord and Putr's lord should be taken into  
consideration. The effects due to such association will be full, or a  
half, or a quarter according to their strengths. (Karakamsh Lagn is the  
Navamsh occupied by the Atma Karak grah).  
  
6-7. Maha Raj Yog: Should Lagn's Lord and Putr's lord exchange their  
rashis or if Atma Karak and Putr Karak (Char) are in Lagn, or in Putr  
Bhava, or in the exaltation rashi, or in own rashi, or in own Navamsh  
receiving a drishti from a benefic, Maha Raj Yog is produced. The native  
so born will be famous and happy.  
  
8. If Lagn's lord and Atma Karak are in Tanu, Putr, or Yuvati Bhava  
yuti with or receiving a drishti from a benefic, a Raj Yog is formed.  
  
9-10. Should there be benefics in the 2nd, the 4th, and the 5th counted  
either from Lagn's lord or from Atma Karak rashi, one will become a  
king. Similarly, malefics in the 3rd and 6th from Lagn's lord or from  
Atma Karak rashi will make one a king.  
  
11. One will be related to royal circles if Shukr is the Karakamsh, or  
in the 5th there from, or in Lagn, or in Arudh Lagn receiving a drishti  
from, or yuti with Guru or Chandr.  
  
12. Even if a single grah gives a drishti to the natal Lagn or Hora  
Lagn or Ghatik Lagn, the native will become a king.  
  
13-14. If the six divisions (Shad Vargas) of Lagn are occupied or  
receive a drishti from one and the same grah, a Raj Yog is doubtlessly  
formed. Accordingly, if the drishti is full, half, or one fourth,  
results will be in order full, medium, and negligible.  
  
15. If the 3 Lagnas (i.e. natal Lagn, Hora Lagn, and Ghatik Lagn) are  
occupied by grahas in exaltation or in own rashi, or if the natal Lagn,  
the Dreshkan Lagn, and the Navamsh Lagn have exalted grahas, Raj Yog  
is formed.  
  
16. If Chandr and a benefic are in the Arudh Lang as Guru is in the 2nd  
from the natal Lagn and both these places are receiving drishtis from  
grahas in exaltation, or grahas in own rashi, there will be a Raj Yog.  
  
17. If Lagn, Dhan, and Bandhu Bhava are occupied be benefics, while a  
malefic is in Sahaj Bhava, one will become a king or equal to a king.  
  
18. The native will be wealthy if one among Chandr, Guru, Shukr, and  
Buddh is exalted in Dhan Bhava.  
  
19. If Ari, Randhr, and Sahaj Bhava are occupied by debilitated grahas  
as Lagn's lord is exalted, or is in (his other) own Bhava, and gives a  
drishti to Lagn, there is a Raj Yog.  
  
20. Again, a Raj Yog is formed if Ari's, Randhr's, and Vyaya's lords are  
in fall or in inimical rashis, or in combustion, as Lagn's lord placed in  
his (other) own rashi or in its exaltation rashi gives a drishti to Lagn.  
  
21. If Karm's lord, placed in his own bhava, or in its exaltation rashi,  
gives a drishti to Lagn, a Raj Yog is formed. Similar is the case if  
benefics are in Kendras. (a Raj Yog is formed) 22. If the Atma Karak  
grah is in a benefic's Rashi/Navamsh, the native will be wealthy. If  
there are benefics in Kendras from Karakamsh Lagn, he will become a king.  
  
23. If the Arudh Lagn and Dar Pad are in mutual Kendras or in mutual  
Sahaj/Labh bhavas, or in mutual Konas, the native will doubtlessly become  
a king.  
  
24. If two or all of Bhava Lagn, Hora Lagn, Ghatik Lagn are receiving  
a drishti from exalted grahas, a Raj Yog is formed.  
  
25. If Bhava Lagn, Hora Lagn, and Ghatik Lagn, their Dreshkanas and  
Navamshas, or the said Lagnas and their Navamshas, or the said Lagnas  
and their Dreshkanas receive a drishti from a grah, a Raj Yog is formed.  
  
26-27. If Arudh Pad is occupied by an exalted grah particularly Chandr  
in exaltation, or by Guru and/or Shukr (with or without exaltation),  
while there is no Argala by a malefic, the native will become a king. If  
the Arudh Pad is a benefic rashi containing Chandr, while Guru is in  
Dhan Bhava the same effect will prevail.  
  
28. Even if one among Ari's, Randhr's, and Vyaya's lords being in  
debilitation gives a drishti to Lagn, there will be a Raj Yog.  
  
29-31. The native will become a king if a grah ruling Bandhu, Karm,  
Dhan, or Labh gives a drishti to Lagn, while Shukr gives a drishti to  
the 11th from Arudh Lagn as Arudh Lagn is occupied by a benefic. The  
same effect will be obtained if a debilitated grah gives a drishti to  
Lagn and is placed in Ari or Randhr Bhava. (i.e. The native will become  
a king) Again, similar result will prevail if a debilitated grah placed  
in Sahaj or Labh Bhava gives a drishti to Lagn. (i.e. The native will  
become a king) 32. I now tell you of the Raj Yogas based on the grahas  
with different dignities and on the drishtis and yutis of the grahas.  
  
33-34. Dharm's lord is akin to a minister, and more especially Putr's  
lord. If these two grahas mutually give a drishti, the native will obtain  
a kingdom. Even if these two are yuti in any bhava, or if they happen  
to be placed in mutually 7th places, one born of royal scion will become  
a king.  
  
35. The native will attain a kingdom if Bandhu's lord is in Karm Bhava  
and Karm's lord is in Bandhu Bhava, and if these grahas give a drishti  
to Putr's and Dharm's lords.  
  
36. If the lords of Putr, Karm, Bandhu, and Lagn are yuti in Dharm Bhava,  
one will become a ruler with fame spreading over the four directions.  
  
37. Should the lord of Bandhu Bhava, or of Karm Bhava join either the  
Putr's lord or Dharm's lord, the native will obtain a kingdom.  
  
38. If Putr's lord is in Lagn, Bandhu, or Karm Bhava yuti with Dharm's  
lord or Lagn lord, the native will become a king.  
  
39. Should Guru be in his own rashi identical with Dharm Bhava and yuti  
with either Shukr or Putr's lord, the native will obtain royal status.  
  
40. Two and a half ghatis (i.e.  
  
60 minutes of time) from mid-day or from mid-night is auspicious time. A  
birth during such an auspicious time will cause one to be a king or  
equal to him.  
  
41. Should Chandr and Shukr be mutually in Sahaj and Labh Bhava and  
receiving drishtis from each other while they are placed elsewhere  
(i.e. not in Sahaj and Labh Bhava), a Raj Yog is obtained.  
  
42. Should Chandr, endowed with strength, be Vargottamsh and receives  
a drishti from four or more grahas, the native will become a king.  
  
43. One will become a king if Lagn in Uttamamsh receives a drishti from  
four or more grahas out of which Chandr should not be one.  
  
44. If one or two or three grahas are in exaltation, one of a royal scion  
will become a king, while another will be equal to a king or be wealthy.  
  
45. If four or five grahas occupy their exaltation rashis or Mooltrikon  
rashis, even a person of base birth will become king.  
  
46. If six grahas are exalted, the native will become emperor and will  
enjoy various kinds of royal paraphernalia.  
  
47. Even if one among Guru, Shukr, and Buddh is in exaltation, while  
a benefic is in a Kendr the native will become a king or be equal to him.  
  
48. If all benefics are relegated to Kendras, while malefics are in  
Sahaj, Ari, and Labh Bhava, the native, though may be of mean descent  
will ascend, the throne.  
  
  
  
Chapter 40 Yogas For Royal Association 1. If Karm's lord is yuti with  
or receives a drishti from the dispositor of Amatya Karak, or even if  
Karm's lord is yuti with or receives a drishti form Amatya Karak himself,  
the native will be a chief in the kings court.  
  
2. If Karm and Labh Bhava are devoid of malefic occupation and devoid  
of drishti from a malefic, while Labh Bhava receives a drishti from its  
own lord, the native will be a chief in the king's court.  
  
3. Should Amatya Karak and the dispositor of Atma Karak be together  
the native will be endowed with great intelligence and will be a king's  
minister. ('Karakendr' is interpreted here as the dispositor of Atma  
Karak. Similarly, 'Amatyesa' means the dispositor of Amatya Karak).  
  
4. If Atma Karak is strong and is with a benefic or Amatya Karak is in  
its own Bhava or in exaltation, one will surely become a king's minister.  
  
5. There is no doubt in one's becoming a king's minister and famous if  
Atma Karak is in Tanu, or Putr, or Dharm Bhava.  
  
6. If Atma Karak or Amatya Karak is placed in a Kendr or in a Kon the  
native will beget royal mercy, royal patronage, and happiness there of.  
  
7. Should malefics be in the 3rd and the 6th from Atma Karak, or from  
Arudh Lagn, or in Sahaj and Ari Bhava, one will become army chief.  
  
8. If Atma Karak is in a Kendr, or in a Kon, or in exaltation, or in  
its own bhava, and gives a drishti to Dharm's lord, the native will be  
a king's minister.  
  
9. If the lord of the rashi where Chandr is placed becomes Atma Karak  
and if this lord is placed in Tanu Bhava along with a benefic, the native  
will become a king's minister at his advanced age.  
  
10. Should the Atma Karak be in Putr, Yuvati, Karm, or Dharm Bhava and  
happen to be with a benefic, one will earn wealth through royal patronage.  
  
11. If the Arudh of Dharm Bhava happens to be itself the Janm Lagn,  
or if Atma Karak is placed in Dharm Bhava the native will be associated  
with royal circles.  
  
12. One will gain through royal association if Labh Bhava is occupied  
by its own lord, and is devoid of a drishti from a malefic. The Atma  
Karak should at the same time be yuti with a benefic.  
  
13. An exchange of rashis between Karm's lord and Lagn's lord will make  
the native associated with the king in a great manner.  
  
14. If Shukr and Chandr are in the 4th from Karakamsh Lagn, the native  
will be endowed with royal insignia.  
  
15. Should Lagn's lord, or the Atma Karak, be yuti with Putr's lord  
and be in a Kendr or in a Kon, the native will be a king or minister.  
  
  
  
Chapter 41 Combinations For Wealth 1. I now tell you of special  
combinations giving wealth. One born to these Yogas will surely become  
wealthy.  
  
2. Yogas for Great Affluence (up to sloka 8): Should a rashi of Shukr  
be Putr Bhava and be occupied by Shukr himself, while Mangal is in Labh  
Bhava, the native will obtain great riches.  
  
3. Should a rashi of Buddh be Putr Bhava and be occupied by Buddh himself  
as Labh Bhava is occupied by Chandr, Mangal, and Guru, the native will  
be very affluent.  
  
4. Should Simh be Putr Bhava and be occupied by Surya himself as Shani,  
Chandr, and Guru are in Labh Bhava, the native will be very affluent.  
  
5. Should Surya and Chandr be in Labh Bhava as Shani is in Putr Bhava  
identical with his own bhava, the native will be very affluent.  
  
6. Should Guru be in Putr Bhava identical with his own rashi as Buddh  
is in Labh Bhava, the native will be very affluent.  
  
7. If a rashi of Mangal happens to be Putr Bhava with Mangal there in  
while Shukr is in Labh Bhava, the native will become very affluent.  
  
8. If Kark happens to be Putr Bhava containing Chandr there in, while  
Shani is in Labh Bhava, the native will become very affluent.  
  
9. Yogas for Wealth (up to sloka 15): Should Surya be in Simh identical  
with Lagn, and be yuti with or receiving a drishti from Mangal and Guru,  
one will be wealthy.  
  
10. Should Chandr be in Kark identical with Lagn, and be yuti with or  
receiving a drishti from Buddh and Guru one will be wealthy.  
  
11. Should Mangal be in Lagn identical with his own rashi and be yuti  
with or receiving a drishti from Buddh, Shukr, and Shani, the native  
will be rich.  
  
12. Should Buddh's rashi be Lagn with Buddh there in and should Buddh  
be yuti with or receiving a drishti from Shani and Guru the native will  
be rich.  
  
13. Should Guru be in Lagn identical with as own rashi and be yuti with  
or receiving a drishti from Buddh and Mangal, the native will be rich.  
  
14. If Shukr happens to be in Lagn identical with his own rashi and  
be yuti with or receiving a drishti from Shani and Buddh, one will  
be wealthy.  
  
15. If Shani is in his own rashi identical with Lagn and receiving  
a drishti from or being yuti with Mangal and Guru, the native will  
be wealthy.  
  
16. Other Qualified Grahas: Dharm's lord and Putr's lord are capable  
of bestowing wealth. Similarly, grahas yuti with Dharm's lord and/or  
Putr's lord are capable of bestowing wealth. There is no doubt that  
these grahas will give wealth during their Dasha periods.  
  
17. The Yogas mentioned above (up to sloka 16) should be delineated  
after knowing favourable or unfavourable dispositions of the participant  
grahas and their strength and weakness.  
  
18-19. Effects of the Divisional Dignities of the Lords of Kendras: If  
the lord of a Kendr is in Parijatamsh, the native will be liberal, if the  
lord of a Kendr is in Uttamamsh the native will be highly liberal, if the  
lord of a Kendr is in Gopuramsh the native will be endowed with prowess,  
if the lord of a Kendr is in Simhasanamsh the native will be honourable,  
(prominent, etc.), if the lord of a Kendr is in Paravatamsh the native  
will be valorous, if the lord of a Kendr is in Devalokamsh the native  
will be head of an assembly, if the lord of a Kendr is in Brahmalokamsh  
the native will be a sage, and if the lord of Kendr is in Iravatamsh  
the native will be delighted and be celebrated in all quarters.  
  
20-22. Effects of the Divisional Dignities of Putr's Lord: If Putr's  
lord is in Parijatamsh, the native will take to the branch of learning  
befitting his race; if Putr's lord is in Uttamamsh the native will have  
excellent learning; if Putr's lord is in Gopuramsh the native will receive  
world-wide honours; if Putr's lord is in Simhasanamsh the native will  
become a minister; if Putr's lord is in also Paravatamsh the native will  
be endowed with Vedic Knowledge; if Putr's lord is in Devalokamsh the  
native will be a Karm Yogi (i.e. a performer of actions, worldly and  
religious rites); if Putr's lord is in Brahmalokamsh the native will  
be devoted to the Lord; and if Putr's lord is in Iravatamsh the native  
will be pious. Notes: While the lords of the four Kendras are treated  
in one and the same breath, Maharishi Parashar gives special importance  
to Putr's and Dharm's lords individually. The effects may suitably be  
understood based on the explanations given above for the lords of Kendras.  
  
23-27. Effects of the Divisional Dignities of Dharm's Lord: If Dharm's  
lord is in Parijatamsh, the native will visit holy places; if Dharm's  
lord is in Uttamamsh, the native has been visiting holy places in the past  
births and he will do the same within this life-time; if Dharm's lord is  
in Gopuramsh the native will perform sacrificial rites; if Dharm's lord  
is in Simhasanamsh the native will be mighty and truthful; he will be a  
conquerer of his senses and will concentrate only on the Brahman, giving  
up all religions; if Dharm's lord is in Paravatamsh the native will be  
the greatest of ascetics; if Dharm's lord is in Devalokamsh the native  
will be an ascetic holding a cudgel (lagudi), or he will be a religious  
mendicant that has renounced all mundane attachments and carrying three  
long staves tied together in his right hand (Tridandin); and if Dharm's  
lord is in Brahmalokamsh the native will perform Aswamedh Yagya (Horse  
Sacrifice) and will attain the state of Lord Indra. If Dharm's lord is  
in Iravatamsh the native will be a synonym of Dharma or virtues just as  
Lord Ram and Yudhishtira (the eldest of Pandavas).  
  
28. Lords of Kendras and Konas Related: The Kendras are known as Vishnu  
Sthanas (i.e. Bhavas of Lord Vishnu), while the Konas are called LakShmi  
Sthanas (i.e. Bhavas of LakShmi). If the lord of a Kendr establishes a  
relationship with the lord of a Kon, a Raj Yog is obtained. (A sixth kind  
of relationship can also be extended in this context to Navamsh positions  
though there is no specific classic sanction for this. For example in  
the case of a Makar native, Mangal in the Navamsh of Shukr, and Shukr  
in the Navamsh of Mangal will confer a superior Raj Yog. This form of  
relationship will be equally superior like the first 3 relationships  
mentioned in the earlier paragraph).  
  
29-34 Effects of the Divisional Dignities of Related Lords of Kendras  
and Lords of Konas (as indicated in sloka 28): If the lord of a Kendr  
and the lord of a Kon, having a relationship as indicated in sloka 28,  
happen to be in Parijatamsh, the native will be king and will protect  
men; if the lord of a Kendr and the lord of a Kon, having a relationship  
as indicated in sloka 28, happen to be in Uttamamsh, the native will  
be an excellent king endowed with elephants, horses, chariots, etc.;  
if the lord of a Kendr and the lord of a Kon, having a relationship as  
indicated in sloka 28, happen to be in Gopuramsh, the native will be  
a tiger of kings honoured by other kings; and if the lord of a Kendr  
and the lord of a Kon, having a relationship as indicated in slokas  
28, happen to be in Simhasanamsh the native will be an emperor ruling  
over the entire earth; with the said Raj Yog relationship of the said  
grahas in Simhasanamsh were born Harish Chandr, Manu, Bali, the Fire god  
(Agni Deva) and many emperors. In the present Yuga so born is Yudhishtira  
(or Dharm Raj of Mahabharat). Salivahana's birth and that of others will  
also come with this Yog. With the lord of a Kendr and the lord of a Kon,  
having a relationship as indicated in sloka 28, placed in Paravatamsh,  
Manu, etc., were born. The Incarnations of Lord Vishnu took place when  
the lord of a Kendr and the lord of a Kon, having a relationship as  
indicated in sloka 28, were placed in Devalokamsh; with the lord of a  
Kendr and the lord of a Kon, having a relationship as indicated in sloka  
28, placed in Brahmalokamsh Lord Brahma was born; and with the lord of  
a Kendr and the lord of a Kon, having a relationship as indicated in  
sloka 28, placed in Iravatamsh the Swayambhu Manu was born. (Manu is  
the first of the 14 Manus, identified as the second creator who produced  
the Prajapatis. To Manu, the code of laws, viz. Manu Smriti is ascribed) .  
  
  
  
Chapter 42 Combinations for Penury 1. O Lord, you have stated many  
Yogas related to acquisition of wealth. Please tell me such Yogas causing  
utter poverty.  
  
2. The native will be penniless if Lagn's lord is in Vyaya Bhava,  
while Vyaya's lord is in Lagn along with the lord of a Marak (a death  
inflicting grah) or receives a drishti from such a grah.  
  
3. The native will be penniless if Lagn's lord is in Ari Bhava, while  
Ari's lord is in Lagn, yuti with or receiving a drishti from a Marak lord.  
  
4. Should Lagn or Chandr be with Ketu, while Lagn's lord is in Randhr  
Bhava, the person concerned will be penniless.  
  
5. If Lagn's lord along with a malefic is in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya  
Bhava, while Dhan's lord is in an enemy's rashi, or in debilitation,  
even a native of royal scion will become penniless.  
  
6. If Lagn's lord is yuti with the lord of Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava,  
or with Shani, and if Lagn's lord is devoid of a drishti from a benefic  
the native will be penniless.  
  
7. Should Putr's and Dharm's lords be respectively found in Ari and  
Vyaya Bhava, and receive a drishti from Marak grahas, the native will  
be penniless.  
  
8. If malefics, excepting the lords of Karm and Dharm Bhava, happen to  
be in Lagn associated with or receiving a drishti from Marak grahas one  
will become penniless.  
  
9. Note the grahas that are ruling the rashis occupied by the lords  
of Ari, Randhr, and Vyaya Bhava. If the said dispositors are in such  
evil bhavas in turn, and are associated with or receive a drishti from  
malefics, the native will be miserable and indigent.  
  
10. The lord of the Navamsh occupied by Chandr, joining a Marak grah  
or occupying a Marak Bhava will make one penniless.  
  
11. Should the lord of the natal Lagn and that of the Navamsh Lagn be  
yuti with or receive a drishti from Marak grahas, one will be penniless.  
  
12. If inauspicious bhavas are occupied by benefics, while auspicious  
bhavas are occupied by malefics, the native will be indigent and will  
be distressed even in the matter of food.  
  
13. A grah associated with one of the lords of Ari, Randhr, and Vyaya  
Bhava, being bereft of a drishti from the lord of a Kon, will in its  
Dasha periods cause harm to the native's financial aspects.  
  
14. If the 8th/12th from Atma Karak, or Randhr/Vyaya Bhava receive a  
drishti from the Atma Karak's Navamsh lord and the lord of Janma Lagn,  
the native will be bereft of wealth.  
  
15. The native will be a spend thrift if the 12th from Atma Karak  
receives a drishti from the dispositor of Atma Karak or if Vyaya Bhava  
receives a drishti from the lord of Lagn.  
  
16-18. Now I tell you some Yogas for poverty along with conditions of  
their nullifications. Should Mangal and Shani be together in Dhan Bhava,  
the native's wealth will be destroyed. Should Buddh give a drishti to  
Mangal and Shani in Dhan Bhava, there will be great wealth. There is no  
doubt in it. Surya in Dhan Bhava receiving a drishti from Shani will  
cause penury; while if Surya is in Dhan Bhava and does not receive a  
drishti from Shani, riches and fame will be obtained. The same effects  
(i.e. poverty) will be declared if Shani is in Dhan Bhava receiving a  
drishti from Surya.  
  
  
  
Chapter 43 Longevity 1. O Maharishi Parashar, you have dealt with  
combinations for wealth and poverty. Kindly detail methods of ascertaining  
the life span of human beings.  
  
2-3.  
  
0 Brahmin, for the benefit of mankind I narrate methods of  
ascertaining longevity; knowing that longevity is difficult even  
for gods. Many exponents have laid down various methods of longevity  
calculations. Following is the summary of such schools of thoughts.  
  
4-8. Pindayu: The grahas contribute to longevity according to their  
being in exaltation, or debilitation, and also based on their strengths  
and weaknesses and positions in Ashvini, etc., and in the various  
rashis. First of all, Pindayu is based on the positions of the grahas. O  
Brahmin, listen carefully to what I say: 19, 25, 15, 12, 15, 21, and 20  
are the number of years contributed by the grahas from Surya, etc., when  
in (deep) exaltation. These are half of the above in (deep) debilitation;  
and if the grahas are in between exaltation and debilitation, the rule of  
three process should be used. Deduct the actual position of the grah from  
its deep exaltation point. If the product is less than 6 rashis, deduct  
it again from 12 rashis. The product concerned should be multiplied by  
the number of years allotted to the grah and divided by 12 to get the  
grah's actual contribution.  
  
9. Rectifications: Excepting Shukr and Shani, the contributions made  
by others should be halved, if they are eclipsed, by Surya. One third  
should be reduced if the grah is in its inimical rashi. This does not  
apply to the one in retrogression (see Vakra Charam).  
  
10-11. Deductions for Grahas in the Visible Half of the Zodiac:    
Full, half, one third, one fourth, one fifth, and one sixth are the  
deductions of contributions made by malefics placed in the visible half  
of the zodiac. Benefics in such cases lose only half of what malefics  
lose. Should there be more than one grah in a bhava, the deduction due to  
the strongest will only prevail, and not deductions due to other grahas  
in that particular bhava. Waning Chandr is a benefic for this purpose.  
  
12-13. Malefics in Lagn: In case Tanu Bhava is occupied by malefics,  
adopt the following procedure: Convert Lagn's Sphuta into minutes of  
arc and multiple it by the years, etc., contributed by the occupant and  
divide by 21600. The years etc. so arrived be deducted from the respective  
contribution which will be the net span donated by the grah. If there is  
benefics drishti on Lagn containing malefics then the loss is only half  
(obtained through these calculations).  
  
14-15. Lagn's Contribution: The number of years contributed by Lagn  
will correspond to the number of rashis it gained (from Mesh), while the  
degrees Lagn has gained in the particular rashi will also correspondingly  
donate (i.e.  
  
30 degrees=l year). If the Lagn's lord in the Navamsh is stronger than  
Lagn's lord, then the contribution should be computed only based on the  
number of Navamshas gained (from Mesh), otherwise the computation will  
be for the Rashi Lagn.  
  
16-17. Nisargayu: O Brahmin, now I tell you about Nisargayu 1, 2, 9,  
20, 18, 20,and 50 are the years allotted to Chandr, Mangal, Buddh, Shukr,  
Guru, Surya, and Shani from the period of birth.  
  
18-19. Amshayu: Now, I will tell you about Amshayu contributions by Lagn  
and grahas. The years correspond to the number of Navamshas counted from  
Mesh. Multiply the longitude in question by 108. If the product exceeds  
12, expunge multiples of 12 and consider the final product in rashis,  
degrees, etc., as years, months, etc..  
  
20-22. The same reductions as per Pindayu apply to Amshayu as well;  
i.e. half for a combust grah, one third for inimical placement and  
the ones due for placements in the half of the zodiac counted from the  
12th backwards. Some scholars suggest further corrections for Amshayu,  
viz. To increase three fold the contribution of a grah in exaltation or  
in own bhava and double the contribution if the contributor is in his own  
Navamsh or in his own Dreshkan. If doubling and trebling is warranted,  
only trebling be done. In case of reductions also, only halving is to  
be done if both halving and reducing a third are required. That is how  
the final life span of men be understood.  
  
23. Longevity for Other Living Beings: For other living beings as well  
such computations can be made. The said figure should be multiplied by  
the figure corresponding to its full span of life and divided by the  
figure corresponding to the full span of life for human beings.  
  
24-29. Full Life Span of Various Living Beings: Now, I'll tell you about  
the full life span figures for various living beings. Gods and sages  
enjoy endless life span (i.e. in astronomical proportions as against  
ordinary mortals). The full life span of eagles, owls, parrots, crows,  
and snakes is one thousand years. For falcon, monkey, bear, and frog  
the full span of life is 300 years. Demon's full life span is 150 years,  
while it is 120 years for human beings.  
  
32 years for horses.  
  
25 years for donkeys and camels, 24 years for oxen and buffaloes,  
20 years for peacocks, 16 years for goats and rams.  
  
14 years for swans, 12 years for cuckoo, dog, and dove, 8 years for hens,  
etc., and 7 years for birds, etc..  
  
30-31. Choice of Longevity: I have narrated 3 different methods  
of longevity. Listen to me about the choice among the three  
systems. According to which of the three: Lagn, Surya, or Chandr is  
stronger than the other two, Amshayu, Pindayu, or Nisargayu should be  
respectively chosen.  
  
32. Doubtful Cases: If two among Lagn, Surya, and Chandr gain equal  
strength, then longevity should be worked out as per both systems and  
the average of both (final) should be considered. If all the three are  
equally strong, the average of the three should be considered.  
  
33-40. Other Clues to Longevity: O excellent of the Brahmins, I will now  
give you details of other methods in the matter of longevity as under:    
This is based on the positions of Lagn's lord, Randhr's lord, Shani,  
Chandr, natal Lagn, and Hora Lagn. These six are grouped into three  
groups, thus: the lords of Lagn and of Randhr Bhava on the one hand,  
Shani and Chandr on the other hand, and the natal Lagn and Hora Lagn on  
yet the other hand. Out of a group of two, if the two are in movable  
rashis long life is denoted. One in a fixed rashi and the other in a  
dual rashi will also bestow long life. One in a movable rashi and the  
other in a fixed rashi will give medium life. If both are in dual rashis  
then, again medium life will be obtained. Short life is denoted if one  
is in a movable rashi as the other is in a dual rashi, or if both are  
in fixed rashis. The type of life denoted by three or two groups be  
only considered. If the three groups denote different scales, then the  
one indicated by the pair of natal Lagn and Hora Lagn should be only  
considered. In case of three different indications if Chandr is in Lagn  
or Yuvati Bhava, then, the one indicated by the Shani-Chandr pair will  
only come to pass.  
  
41-44. Further Clarifications: If long life is denoted by all the said  
three groups, the span is 120 years, if by two groups it is 108 years,  
and if only by one group it is 91 years. If medium life is arrived at  
by three groups it is 80 years, if medium life span is indicated by 2  
groups it is 72 years, and if medium life span is indicated by one group  
it is 64 years. If short life is denoted by the said three groups it is  
only 32 years, if short life is indicated by two groups, the life span  
is 36 years, and if short life is indicated by one group the life span  
is 40 years. These are rectified as under.  
  
45-46. Rectifications: If the contributor is in the beginning of a rashi,  
his donation will be full, and it will be nil if he is at the end of a  
rashi. For intermediary placements, rule of the process will apply. Add  
the longitudes of the contributors (devoid of rashis) and the sum so  
arrived at must be divided by the number of contributors. The latest  
product should be multiplied by the number of basic years and divided  
by 30. This will yield the net longevity.  
  
47. Special Rule for Shani: Should Shani be a contributor, the class  
of longevity declines. Some advocate contrarily, an increase of class  
in this context. If Shani is in its own rashi or in exaltation, change  
in class will not occur. Even if he receives a drishti from or is yuti  
with only a malefic, no change occurs.  
  
48. Special Rule for Guru: If Guru is in Lagn or in Yuvati Bhava,  
and receives a drishti from or is yuti with only benefics, the class of  
longevity will increase.  
  
49-50. Increase and Fall in Class of Longevity: From very short life  
to short life, from short life to medium life, from medium life to long  
life and from long life to extremely long life are the increases in the  
classification of longevity when Guru warrants an increase. The reverse  
is true if Shani warrants a fall in the span of life.  
  
51. (Maitreya says): You have narrated various kinds of longevity  
computations. Please favour me by denoting subtle classes there of and  
poor and long life spans.  
  
52. (Maharishi Parashar replies): These are seven-fold, viz. Bal Risht,  
Yog Risht, short, medium, long, super-natural (Divya), and immortality  
(Amritayu).  
  
53-54. The life span in Bal Risht is 8 years, in Yog Risht 20  
years; in short, medium, and long lives respectively 32, 64, and 120  
years. Super-natural life span is 1000 years. Above this super-natural  
life span of 1000 years it is Amritayu, which can be acquired only by  
those who deserve it (Merits).  
  
55. Limitless Longevity: Should Kark be Lagn with Guru and Chandr there  
in, while Shukr and Buddh are in Kendras, and others are in Sahaj, Ari,  
and Labh Bhava, the native will obtain limitless longevity.  
  
56. Super-natural Longevity: One having benefics in Kendras and/or Konas,  
while malefics are in Sahaj, Ari, and Labh Bhava will obtain super-natural  
life span (one thousand years). Randhr Bhava in this case should be one  
of the rashis owned by a benefic.  
  
57. Living until the End of the Yuga: One born in Kark Lagn will live  
till the end of the yuga if Guru is in a Kendr and happens to be in  
Gopuramsh, while Shukr is in a Kon and happens to be in Paravatamsh.  
  
58. Living the Life Span of a Sage: Guru in Simhasanamsh being in Lagn,  
Shani in Devalokamsh, and Mangal in Paravatamsh; if these are so, one  
will enjoy the life span as due to a sage.  
  
59. Good Yogas increase the life span and bad Yogas decrease the same  
(as arrived by mathematical means). Hence, I tell you such Yogas as to  
know of full, medium, and short span combinations.  
  
60. If a Kendr contains a benefic, while Lagn's lord is yuti with or  
receives a drishti from a benefic, or Guru in particular, the native  
will live a full span of life.  
  
61. Should Lagn's lord be in a Kendr yuti with or receiving a drishti  
from Guru and Shukr, full life span will result.  
  
62. If at birth three grahas are exalted, out of which the lords,  
of Lagn and Randhr Bhava are inclusive, as Randhr Bhava is devoid of a  
malefic in it, full life span will result.  
  
63. Long life is denoted if three grahas are in Randhr Bhava, in  
exaltation, own or friendly divisions, while Lagn's lord is strong.  
  
64. If Shani or Lagn's lord is yuti with any exalted grah, long life  
will result.  
  
65. Long life will be enjoyed if malefics are in Sahaj, Ari, and Labh  
Bhava, while benefics are in Kendras.  
  
66. If Ari, Yuvati, and Randhr Bhava are occupied by benefics, while  
malefics are in Sahaj and Labh Bhava, full life span will follow the  
birth.  
  
67. If Randhr's lord is friendly to Surya, while malefics are in Ari  
and Vyaya Bhava, as Lagn's lord is in a Kendr, the native will live the  
full span of life.  
  
68.  
  
0 excellent of the Brahmins, if a malefic is in Randhr Bhava, while  
Karm's lord is exalted, one will be long lived.  
  
69. Long life will follow if Lagn is a dual rashi, while Lagn's lord  
is in a Kendr, or in exaltation, or in a Kon.  
  
70. Should Lagn be a dual rashi, while two malefics are in a Kendr with  
reference to a strong Lagn's lord, long life is indicated.  
  
71-73. If the stronger among Lagn's lord and Randhr's lord is placed  
in a Kendr long life is indicated; and if in a Panaphara (Dhan, Putr,  
Randhr, or Labh Bhava) medium life is indicated; If the stronger among  
Lagn's lord and Randhr's lord is placed in Apoklima (Sahaj, Ari, Dharm,  
or Vyaya Bhava) short life will come to pass. According to Lagn's lord  
being friendly, neutral, or inimical to Surya, long, medium, or short  
life will result.  
  
74. Should Mangal and Sahaj's lord, or Randhr's lord and Shani, be  
combust or (two of either pair) be yuti with malefics or receive a  
drishti from malefics, there will be short life.  
  
75. If Lagn's lord is in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava yuti with malefics  
and devoid of yuti with and/or drishti from a benefic, short life will  
come to pass.  
  
76. If malefics are in Kendras devoid of yuti with or a drishti from  
benefics, while Lagn's lord is not strong, only short life will result.  
  
77.  
  
0 excellent of Brahmins, if Vyaya and Dhan Bhava are occupied by malefics  
and devoid of a drishti from a benefic or devoid of yuti with a benefic,  
the native will be short-lived.  
  
78. If the lords of Lagn and Randhr Bhava are bereft of dignities and  
strength, short life will come to pass. If the lords of Lagn and Randhr  
Bhava are helped by others, while being so, medium life span will come  
to pass.  
  
  
  
Chapter 44 Marak (Killer) Grahas 1. O Maharishi Parashar, you have  
mentioned a lot about longevity. Be kind enough to throw light on Marakas  
or killers.  
  
2-5.  
  
0 Brahmin, Sahaj and Randhr Bhava are the two bhavas of longevity. The  
bhavas related to death are the 12th from each of these, i.e. Dhan and  
Yuvati Bhava are Marak Bhavas.  
  
3. Out of the two (i.e. Dhan and Yuvati Bhava), Dhan Bhava is a powerful  
Marak Bhava (as against Yuvati Bhava). The lords of Dhan and Yuvati Bhava,  
malefics in Dhan and Yuvati Bhava, and malefics yuti with Dhan's lord  
and yuti with Yuvati's lord, are all known as Marakas. The major and  
sub periods of these grahas will bring death on the native depending on  
whether he has a long life, medium life, or short life person.  
  
6-7. The Dasha of a benefic grah related to Vyaya's lord may also inflict  
death. End may descend on the native in Randhr's lord's Dasha. The Dasha  
of a grah which is an exclusive malefic (i.e. first-rate malefic) may  
also cause death.  
  
9. Should Shani be ill-disposed and be related to a Marak grah, he will  
be the first to kill in preference to other grahas.  
  
10-14.  
  
0 Brahmin, I tell you further about Marakas. Narrated earlier are three  
kinds of life spans, viz. short, medium, and long. Short life is before  
32 years, later on up to 64 it is medium life, and from 64 to 100 it  
is long life. Beyond 100 the longevity is called supreme. O excellent  
of the Brahmins, it is impossible to decide upon longevity till the  
native is 20 years old. Till such year the child should be protected by  
sacred recitations, religious offerings (of ghee, etc., to consecrated  
fire as prescribed in the Vedas, etc., and through medical treatments,  
for premature death may descend on the child due to sins of father and  
mother or of its own (in the previous birth).  
  
15-21. I further mention about the Marak grahas. One born with short  
life combinations may face death in the Dasha denoted by Vipat star (the  
3rd from the birth star); one of medium life may die in the Dasha denoted  
by Pratyak star (the 5th from the birth star). In the Dasha denoted by  
Vadh star (the 7th from the birth star), one with long life may obtain  
his end. The Dasha of the lord of the 22nd Dreshkan, or the Dasha of the  
lord of the 23rd, or the Dasha of the lord of the 3rd, or the Dasha of  
the lord of the 5th, or the Dasha of the lord of the 7th asterisms may  
also cause death. The lords of the 2nd and the 12th counted from Kark  
may bring death, this is true when Chandr is a malefic; if he happens  
to be a benefic there will be (only) diseases (but not death). Death  
may come to pass in the Dasha of Ari's lord and in the sub periods of  
Ari's, Randhr's, and/or Vyaya's lords. Should there be many Marakas  
(endowed with the power of killing),and if these Marakas are strong,  
there will be diseases, miseries, etc., in major and sub periods. Thus,  
these are Marakas (as is mentioned above) and are primarily related to  
bring death upon the native. According to their dispositions there may  
be death or difficulties.  
  
22-24. Rahu and Ketu as Marakas: If Rahu or Ketu are placed in Tanu,  
Yuvati, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava, or happen to be in the 7th from a Marak  
lord, or are placed with such a grah, they acquire powers of killing  
in their major or sub periods. For one born in Makar, or in Vrischik,  
Rahu will be a Marak. Should Rahu be in Ari, Randhr, or Vyaya Bhava,  
he will give difficulties in his Dasha periods. He will not, however,  
do so if Rahu receives a drishti from, or is yuti with a benefic.  
  
25-31. Sahaj Bhava and Death: O excellent of Brahmins, if Surya, being  
with strength, is in Sahaj Bhava, one will obtain his death due to a king  
(or legal punishments); Chandr in Sahaj Bhava will cause death due to  
tuberculosis, while wounds, weapons, fire, and thirst will cause death  
through Mangal in Sahaj Bhava. If Sahaj Bhava receives a drishti from,  
or is occupied by Shani and Rahu, death will be through poison, water,  
or fire, or fall from heights, or confinement. Death will surely come to  
descend through insects or leprosy if Chandr and Gulik occupy or give  
a drishti to Sahaj Bhava. Buddh giving a drishti to or occupying Sahaj  
Bhava will bring death followed by fever. Guru in Sahaj Bhava or giving a  
drishti to Sahaj Bhava will cause death by swelling or tumours. Urinary  
diseases will cause death if Shukr is in, or gives a drishti to Sahaj  
Bhava. Many grahas giving a drishti to or occupying Sahaj Bhava will  
bring death through many diseases.  
  
32, If Sahaj Bhava is occupied by a benefic, death will be in an  
auspicious place (like a shrine); and if Sahaj Bhava is occupied by a  
malefic death will be in sinful places. Mixed occupation of Sahaj Bhava  
will yield mixed results with regard to the place of death.  
  
33. Consciousness will prevail at the time of death if Guru or Shukr  
are placed in Sahaj Bhava. With other grahas in Sahaj Bhava, there will  
be unconsciousness before death.  
  
34. According to Sahaj Bhava being a movable, a fixed, or a dual rashi,  
death will be respectively in a foreign place (other than native birth  
place), in one's own house, or on the way.  
  
35-36: Occupants of Randhr Bhava: Note the occupant of Randhr Bhava: If  
it is Surya, death will be through fire; if Chandr is in Randhr Bhava,  
death will be through water; if Mangal is in Randhr Bhava, death will  
be through weapons; if Buddh is in Randhr Bhava, death will be through  
fever; if Guru is in Randhr Bhava, death will be through diseases; if  
Shukr is in Randhr Bhava, death will be through hunger; and if Shani is  
in Randhr Bhava, death will be through thirst.  
  
37. If Randhr Bhava is occupied by or receives a drishti from a benefic,  
while Dharm's lord is yuti with a benefic the native will die in a  
shrine. If Randhr Bhava is occupied by or receives a drishti from a  
malefic, while Dharm's lord is yuti with a malefic, death will be in a  
place other than a shrine.  
  
38-39. Fate of the Human Physical System: Should there be a benefic's  
Dreshkan in Randhr Bhava (i.e. the 22nd Dreshkan), the body will be burnt  
in fire (as prescribed in Shastras); if a malefic's Dreshkan happens  
to be in Randhr Bhava, the body will be thrown away in water; if the  
Dreshkan in Randhr Bhava is owned by a mixed grah the dead body will  
only dry up; if the Dreshkan in Randhr Bhava is a serpent Dreshkan, the  
body will be eaten away by animals, crows, etc.; 40. Serpent Dreshkanas:    
The 2nd and 3rd Dreshkan in Kark, the initial one in Vrischik, and the  
last one in Meen are designated as serpent Dreshkanas.  
  
41-42. Pre-natal Abode: O excellent of Brahmins, the stronger of the  
two luminaries, Surya and Chandr, occupying a Dreshkan of Guru denotes  
the descent from the world of gods. If the stronger of the luminaries,  
Surya and Chandr, occupies the Dreshkan of Shukr or Chandr, the descent  
is from the world of the Manes; if the stronger of the two luminaries,  
Surya and Chandr, is in the Dreshkan of Surya or Mangal, the descent is  
from the world of Yama (the world of the death); and if the stronger of  
the two luminaries, Surya and Chandr, is in Dreshkan of Buddh or Shani,  
the descent is from the hell.  
  
43-45. Ascent after Death: According to the following grahas in Vyaya,  
Yuvati, Ari, or Randhr Bhava, the native will attain one of the different  
worlds after death: Guru: heaven; Chandr or Shukr: the world of Manes;  
Mangal and/or Surya: earth (i.e. rebirth); Buddh and/or Shani: hell. In  
case the said bhavas are not occupied, the native will go to the world  
indicated by the stronger of the Dreshkan lords related to Ari and Randhr  
Bhava. The relative grah's exaltation, etc., will denote the high, medium,  
and low status the native will obtain in the said world. world of Yama  
(the world of the death); and if the stronger of the two luminaries,  
Surya and Chandr, is in Dreshkan of Buddh or Shani, the descent is from  
the hell.  
  
43-45. Ascent after Death: According to the following grahas in Vyaya,  
Yuvati, Ari, or Randhr Bhava, the native will attain one of the different  
worlds after death: Guru: heaven; Chandr or Shukr: the world of Manes;  
Mangal and/or Surya: earth (i.e. rebirth); Buddh and/or Shani: hell. In  
case the said bhavas are not occupied, the native will go to the world  
indicated by the stronger of the Dreshkan lords related to Ari and  
Randhr Bhava. The relative grah's exaltation, etc., will denote the high,  
medium, and low status the native will obtain in the said world.  
  
46. Other grahas and rashis becoming Marakas are being discussed in  
the chapter related to Dashas.  
  
  
  
Chapter 45 Avasthas of Grahas 1. O Maharishi Parashar, you have earlier  
stated that the Avasthas, or states, of the grahas are to be considered  
in the context of the effects of the grahas. Be so kind to tell me  
about this.  
  
2.  0 excellent of Brahmins, various kinds of Avasthas of the grahas  
have been expounded. Out of these, I will give you the summary of BAl  
(infant) and other states of the grahas (in the first instance).  
  
3. BAl, Kumar, Yuv, Vriddh, and Mrit Avastha: Infant, youthful,  
adolescent, old, and dead are the states of the grahas placed in the  
ascending order at the rate of six degrees in odd rashis. In the case of  
even rashis this arrangement is in reverse order. (These five Avasthas  
are known as BAl Adi Avasthas. For odd rashis, the placement concerned  
will denote the Avastha as under: BAl Avastha (Infant state): O to  
6 degrees Kumar Avastha (Youthful state): 6 to 12 degrees Yuv Avastha  
(Adolescent state): 12 to 18 degrees Vriddh Avastha (Advanced state):    
18 to 24 degrees Mrit Avastha (In extremis): 24 to 30 degrees The above  
order is to be reversed for placement in an even rashi).  
  
4. Results: One fourth, half, full, negligible, and nil are the grades  
of the results due to a grah in infant, youthful, adolescent, old,  
and dead Avasthas.  
  
5. Awakening, Dreaming, and Sleeping States: If a grah is in its own  
rashi, or in exaltation it is said to be in a state of awakening (or  
alertness). In the rashi of a friend or of a neutral rashi, it is in  
dreaming state, while in an enemy's rashi, or in debilitation it is in  
a state of sleeping.  
  
6. According to a grah being in Awakening, Dreaming or Sleeping states,  
the results due to it will be full, medium, or nil.  
  
7. Other Kinds of States: There are nine kinds of other Avasthas,  
viz. Dipt, Swasth, Pramudit, Shanta, Din, Vikal, Khal, and Kop.  
  
8-10. If a grah is in its exaltation rashi, it is in Dipt Avastha;  
if a grah is in its own rashi, it is in Swasth Avastha, if a grah is  
in a great friend's rashi, it is in Pramudit Avastha; if a grah is in a  
friendly rashi, it is in Shanta Avastha; if a grah is in a neutral rashi,  
it is in Din Avastha; if a grah is yuti with a malefic, it is in Vikal  
Avastha; if a grah is in an enemy's rashi, it is in Duhkhit Avastha; if a  
grah is in a great enemy's rashi it is in Khal Avastha; and if a grah is  
being eclipsed by Surya, it is in Kop Avastha. Depending on such a state  
of the grah, the bhava occupied by it will obtain corresponding effects.  
  
8. Yet Other Avasthas: Lajjit, Garvit, Kshudhit, Trushit, Mudit, and  
Kshobhit are the (six) other kinds of Avasthas due to the grahas. Placed  
in Putr Bhava, if a grah is associated with Rahu or Ketu, or with Surya,  
Shani, or Mangal, it is in Lajjit Avastha. If a grah is in exaltation or  
in Mooltrikon, it is Gavit Avastha. If a grah is in an enemy's rashi,  
or yuti with an enemy, or receives a drishti from an enemy, or even  
if a grah is yuti with Shani, the Avastha is Kshudhit. If a grah is  
in a watery rashi and receives a drishti from a malefic but does not  
receive a drishti from a benefic, the Avastha is called Trushit. If a  
grah is in a friendly rashi, or is yuti with, or receives a drishti from  
a benefic, or is yuti with Guru, it is said to be in Mudit Avastha. If  
a grah is yuti with Surya and receives a drishti from, or is yuti with  
a malefic, or receives a drishti from an enemy, it is said to be in  
Kshobhit Avastha. The bhavas occupied by a grah in Kshudhit Avastha or  
in Kshobhit Avastha are destroyed.  
  
19-23. The learned should estimate the effects due to a bhava in the  
manner cited above (i.e. with the help of various kinds of Avasthas),  
after ascertaining the strength and weakness (of the various grahas). Weak  
grahas cause reduction in good effects ,while stronger ones give greater  
effects. If a grah posited in Karm Bhava is in Lajjit Avastha, in Kshudhit  
Avastha, or in Kshobhit Avastha, the person will always be subjected to  
miseries. If a grah in Putr Bhava is in Lajjit Avastha, there will be  
destruction of progeny, or there will be only one surviving child. Surely  
the wife of the native will die if there is a grah in Yuvati Bhava in  
Kshobhit Avastha or in Trushit Avastha.  
  
24-29. Effects of Garvit, Mudit, Lajjit, Kshobhit, Kshudhit, and Trushit  
Avastha: A grah in Garvit Avastha will cause happiness through new houses  
and gardens, regalhood, skill in arts, financial gains at all times, and  
improvement in business. A grah in Mudit Avastha will give residences,  
clothes, ornaments, happiness from lands and wife, happiness from  
relatives, living in royal places, destruction of enemies, and acquisition  
of wisdom and learning. A grah in Lajjit Avastha will give aversion to  
God, loss of intelligence, loss of child, interest in evil speeches,  
and listlessness in good things. A grah in Kshobhit Avastha will give  
acute penury, evil disposition, miseries, financial debacles, distress  
to feet and obstruction to income due to royal wrath. A grah in Kshudhit  
Avastha will cause downfall due to grief and passion, grief on account of  
relatives, physical decline, troubles from enemies, financial distress,  
loss of physical strength and an eclipsed mind due to miseries. A grah  
in Trushit Avastha will cause diseases through association with females,  
leading over wicked (or evil) deeds, loss of wealth due to ones own men,  
physical weakness, miseries caused by evil people, and decline of honour.  
  
30-37. Calculation of Shayan and Other Avasthas: Now, I will tell you of  
the Avasthas viz. Shayan, Upavesan, Netrapani, Prakash, Gaman, Agaman,  
Sabh, Agam, Bhojan, Nritya Lips, Kautuk, and Nidr, and the Chesthas of  
such Avasthas. Note the number of the stars (from Ashvini) occupied by  
the grah for which an Avastha is to be calculated. Multiply that number  
by the number denoted by the grah (Surya 1, Chandr 2, Mangal 3, Buddh 4,  
Guru 5, Shukr 6, and Shani 7). The figure so arrived at should again be  
multiplied by the number of the Navamsh where the grah is in. Add to  
this the number of the birth asterism, the number of ghatis of birth,  
and the number of rashis Lagn gained from Mesh. This figure should be  
divided by 12 and the remainder will indicate the corresponding Avastha  
of the grah. The sub state in the said Avastha can be found out in the  
following way: Multiply the figure denoted by the Avastha concerned  
(i.e. Sayan 1, Upavesan 2, Netrapani 3, Prakash 4, Gaman 5, Agaman 6,  
Sabh 7, Agam 8, Bhojan 9, Nritya Lips 10, Kautuk 11, and Nidr 12) by the  
same figure and increase it by the figure denoted by the Anka value for  
the first syllable of the native's personal name. Divide the product  
so obtained by 12. The remainder there of should be further increased  
by constant additives of the Buddh 3, Guru 5, Shukr 3, Shani 3, Rahu 4  
(and Ketu 4). (Here the grah means the one for whom the sub state is  
being known.) The product so arrived at should be divided by 3. In the  
process of calculation if it happens that the remainder is 1, it is  
Drishti, if the remainder is 2, it is Chesht, and if the remainder is  
0, it is Vichesht. Notes: So far narrated are three different groups of  
Avasthas. The present Avasthas are called Shayan Adi Avasthas. These are  
of supreme importance as compared to the other kinds of Avasthas.. The  
following formula may be adopted to know about the grah's Avastha (Sayan  
Adi) at birth: (s x p x n) + (a + g + r) ------------------------- =  
Avastha 12 Where as s denotes the serial number of the star occupied by  
the grah, counted from Ashvini at birth; p denotes the status of the  
grah counted from Surya (i.e. Surya 1, Chandr 2, Mangal 3, Buddh 4,  
Guru 5, Shukr 6, Shani 7); n denotes the grah's Navamsh position (i.e.  
  
1 to 9 Navamshas); 'a' denotes Janm NakShatr (or ruling star, i.e. the  
one occupied by Chandr); 'g' denotes the ghati in which birth took place  
(i. e.  
  
20 ghatis 2 vighatis is 21 ghatis); and 'r' denotes Lagn 's order counted  
from Mesh (i.e. Mesh 1, Vrishabh 2, Kark 4, Simh 5, and so on and so  
forth). In place of n given above, some translators interpret the word  
Amsh as degree occupied by the grah which is obviously not correct. In  
this connection, the reader's attention is drawn to Balabhadr's Hora  
Ratna, ch 3 wherein the author Balabhadr himself gives an example for  
Surya being in the 7th Navamsh of Simh and thus he considered only  
7 as multiplier. He has not taken in to account Surya's degree. He  
quotes Adhibhut Sagara as his authority for calculation of Sayan Adi  
Avasthas. It will thus be clear that Amsh is Navamsh and not degree  
in this context. Also please note that Agaman Avastha (the 6th one)  
is known as Gamanechch Avastha by some exponents. Take a case now as an  
example with the following data: Surya in Kritika NakShatr, 3rd Navamsh  
of Vrishabh (i.e. in 7 degrees 12' Vrishabh), the birth star is Kritika,  
birth is at 30 ghatis 33 vighatis, and Lagn is in Vrischik. With these we  
produce the following information, keeping the formula given above. s =  
3, p = 1, n = 3; a = 3, g = 31, r = 8. Hence to find out the Avastha,  
(3 x 1 x 3) + (3 + 31 + 8) 51 -+- ----------------------- ---- 12 12  
With the help of remainder 3, we count three Avasthas from Sayan. This  
indicates Netrapani Avastha for Surya. Similarly, for 9 grahas, such  
Avasthas can be found out. In a given horoscope, the factors a, g, and r  
will be identical for all the 9 grahas, while factors s, p, and n will be  
variable. After knowing the Avasthas of various grahas, we have to find  
out the sub-state of each Avastha. The formula for knowing the sub-state  
is made in two stages, as under: Stage 1: (A x A) + fs ------------ =  
R 12 Stage 2: (R + pa) : 3 = sub-state of an Avastha Where A is Avastha,  
f is first syllable's value with reference to the native's personal name,  
R is remainder in stage 1, and pa is the additives of the grah denoted  
in the above slokas, such as Surya 5, Shukr 3, etc.. The remainder at  
stage 2 will denote the sub-state such as 1 is Drishti, 2 is Chesht, and  
0 is Vichesht. We need information about the Anka value, or value for the  
first syllable of the name of a person. This value is: 1 for a, ka, cha,  
da (retroflex), and va; 2 for i, kha, ja, da (dental), and sha; 3 for u,  
ga, jha, ta (dental), pa, ya, and sha; 4 for e, gha, ta (retroflex), tha  
(dental), pha, ra, and ma; 5 for o, ca, tha (retroflex), da (dental), and  
ha. Now with the above data, find the sub-state for Surya in Netrapani  
Avastha as per the example given supra. First syllable of the name is  
Sa. Hence, (3 x 3) + 4 Stage 1: ---------- = Remainder 1 12 (1 + 5)  
Stage 2: ------- = 0 3 Remainder zero indicates sub-state as Vichesht,  
in Netrapani Avastha.  
  
38-39. Effects of Chesht, etc. : If the sub-state is Drishti in an  
Avastha, the results being stated for the Avastha will be medium; the  
effects will be full in Chesht, and negligible in Vichesht. The good  
and bad effects of grahas should be deciphered based on the strength  
and weakness of the grahas. In exaltation, the grahas reveal effects in  
a pronounced manner due to (good) Avasthas.  
  
40-51. Effects of Surya's Avasthas at Birth: If Surya is in Sayan  
Avastha, the native will incur digestive deficiency, many diseases,  
stoutness of legs, bilious vitiation, ulcer in the anus, and heart  
strokes. If Surya is in Upavesan Avastha, the native will suffer poverty,  
will carry loads, will indulge in litigations, be hard-hearted, wicked,  
and will lose in his undertakings. If Surya is in Netrapani Avastha,  
the native will always be happy, wise, helpful to others, endowed with  
prowess, and wealth, very happy, and will gain royal favours. If Surya  
is in Prakash Avastha, the native will be liberal in disposition, will  
have plenty of wealth, will be a significant speaker in the assembly,  
will perform many meritorious acts, will be greatly strong, and will be  
endowed with charming beauty. If Surya is in Gaman Avastha the native will  
be disposed to live in foreign places; he will be miserable, indolent,  
bereft of intelligence and wealth; he will be distressed due to fear  
and he will be short-tempered. If Surya is in Agaman Avastha, the native  
will be interested in others' wives; he will be devoid of his own men,  
he will be interested in movements and skilful in doing evil deeds; he  
will be dirty, ill-disposed and he will be a tale bearer. If Surya is  
in Sabh Avastha, the native will be disposed to help others; he will be  
always endowed with wealth and gems; he will be virtuous, endowed with  
lands, new houses and robes; he will be very strong, very affectionate  
to his friends, and very kindly disposed. If Surya is in Agam Avastha,  
the native will be distressed due to enemies, fickle-minded, evil-minded,  
emaciated, devoid of virtuous acts and intoxicated with pride. If Surya  
is in Bhojan Avastha, the native will experience pains in joints; he  
will lose money on account of others' females, he will have strength  
declining off and on; he will be untruthful, will incur head-aches,  
will eat remnant food, and will take to bad ways. If Surya is in Nritya  
Lips Avastha, the native will be honoured by the learned; he will be a  
scholar, will have knowledge of poetry, etc., and he will be adored by  
kings on the earth. If Surya is in Kautuk Avastha, the native will always  
be happy; he will be endowed with Vedic Knowledge and he will perform  
Yagyas; he will move amidst kings, will have fear from enemies; he will  
be charming-faced and he will be endowed with knowledge of poetry. If  
Surya is in Nidr Avastha, the native will have a strong tendency towards  
being drowsy; he will live in foreign (or distant) places; he will incur  
harm to his wife and will face financial destruction. Surya in Upavesan  
Avastha will make one an artisan, black in complexion, devoid of learning  
and miserable. One will serve others. In Netrapani Avastha there will  
be all kinds of happiness, if Surya is in Putr, Dharm, Karm, or Yuvati  
Bhava. In other bhavas (i.e. not in Putr, Dharm, Karm, or Yuvati Bhava),  
Netrapani Avastha of Surya will give eye diseases and enmity with all. If  
Surya is in Prakash Avastha, the native will be meritorious, religious,  
and liberal; he will enjoy pleasures, will be equal to a prince, and will  
enjoy the status of Kuber, the God of wealth. However, the Prakash Avastha  
of Surya placed in Yuvati, or Putr Bhava will cause loss of the first  
child and will produce many litigations. If Surya is in Gaman Avastha,  
the native will incur disease of the feet and he will be very mean. If in  
Agaman Avastha, Surya in Vyaya or in Yuvati Bhava will destroy progeny  
and will give very limited wealth. If in Agam Avastha, Surya will give  
many miseries, an ugly appearance, and foolishness. However, he will give  
wealth. Surya in Bhojan Avastha in Dharm Bhava will cause many hindrances  
to spiritual and religious undertakings. In other bhavas (i.e. other than  
Dharm Bhava), Surya in Bhojan Avastha will cause head and ear diseases,  
apart from joint pains. Though Maharishi Parashar states that the native  
with Surya in Kautuk Avastha will have fear from enemies Bal Bhadr exempts  
such evil effect for the Ari Bhava position. Surya in Kautuk Avastha in  
other bhavas (i.e. not in Ari Bhava), will give a number of daughters, two  
wives, itch, excellence, liberality, etc.. If Surya is in Nidr Avastha,  
the native will be predisposed to incur piles and elephantiasis; he will  
experience a lack of peace; and he will be liable to lose his first child.  
  
52-63. Effects of Chandr's Avasthas at Birth: If Chandr is in Sayan  
Avastha, the native will be honourable, sluggish, given to sexual lust,  
and he will face financial destruction. If Chandr is in Upavesan Avastha,  
the native will be troubled by diseases, he will be dull-witted, not  
endowed with mentionable wealth (i.e. will have only negligible wealth);  
he will be hard-hearted, will do unworthy acts, and will steal others'  
wealth. If Chandr is in Netrapani Avastha, the native will be troubled  
by great diseases (long lasting in nature), be very garrulous, wicked,  
and he will indulge in bad deeds. Should Chandr be in Prakash Avastha,  
the native will be famous in the world, he will have his virtues exposed  
through royal patronage; he will be surrounded by horses, elephants,  
females, and ornaments; he will visit shrines. If Chandr is in Gaman  
Avastha, with decreasing rays the native will be sinful, cruel, and  
always troubled by afflictions of sight; if Chandr is in Gaman Avastha  
with increasing rays, the native will be distressed due to fear. If  
Chandr is in Agaman Avastha, the native will be honourable; he will  
suffer diseases of the feet; he will secretly indulge in sinful acts; he  
will be poor and devoid of intelligence and happiness. If Chandr is in  
Sabh Avastha, the native will be eminent among men, honoured by kings,  
and kings of kings; he will be very beautiful, will subdue the passion  
of women and he will be skilful in sexual acts; he will be virtuous. If  
Chandr is in Agam Avastha, the native will be garrulous, and virtuous and  
if the said Chandr is of dark fortnight the native will have two wives;  
he will be sick, highly wicked, and he will be violent. If Chandr is  
in Bhojan Avastha, the native will be endowed with honour, conveyances,  
attendants, social status, wife and daughters, provided Chandr is Full  
'Purna Chandr'; if Chandr is in Bhojan Avastha and is of dark fortnight  
auspicious effects (i.e. honour, conveyances, attendants, social status,  
wife and daughters) will fail to come. If Chandr is in Nritya Lips Avastha  
and is endowed with (fort nightly) strength, the native will be strong,  
he will have knowledge of songs, and he will be a critic of beauty  
of things. If Chandr is in Nritya Lips Avastha and of dark fortnight,  
i.e. not endowed with strength, the person will be sinful. If Chandr is  
in Kautuk Avastha, the native will attain kinship, lordship over wealth,  
and skill in sexual acts and in sporting with harlots. Should waxing  
Chandr being yuti with Guru be in Nidr Avastha, the native will be quite  
eminent. If waxing Chandr is in Nidr Avastha but devoid of Guru's yuti,  
the native will lose his wealth on account of females, and female jackals  
will be crying around his abode (as though it were a cemetery).  
  
64-75. Effects of the Avasthas of Mangal at Birth: If Mangal is in  
Sayan Avastha, the native will be troubled by wounds, itch, and ulcer. If  
Mangal is placed in Upavesan Avastha,the native will be strong, sinful,  
untruthful, eminent, wealthy, and bereft of virtues. If Mangal is placed  
in Lagn and happen to be in Netrapani Avastha there will be penury; if  
Mangal is placed in other bhavas (i.e. in one of the bhavas other than  
Tanu Bhava), Netrapani Avastha will confer rulership of a city. Should  
Mangal be in Prakash Avastha, the native will shine with virtues and will  
be honoured by the king. Mangal in Prakash Avastha in Putr Bhava will,  
cause loss of children and of wife. If Mangal is in Prakash Avastha  
in Putr Bhava and happens to be there with Rahu, a severe (positional)  
fall will descend on the native. Should Mangal be in Gaman Avastha the  
native will be always roaming, will have fear of multiple ulcers, will  
incur misunderstandings with females, will be afflicted by boils, itches,  
etc., and will incur financial decline. If Mangal happens to be in Agaman

will be bereft of learning; if Mangal is in Sabh Avastha in Vyaya Bhava  
childlessness and no wife and no friends will result; and if Mangal is

Avastha, the native will be a scholar in a king's court (i.e. be a poet  
laureate), be very wealthy, honourable, and charitable. If Mangal is in  
Agam Avastha, the native will be devoid of virtues and good deeds, will  
be distressed by diseases, will acquire diseases of the root of the ears  
('Karan Mularogam' and 'Padamulam Urumulam', etc.), and severe gout pains;  
he will be timid and will befriend evil lot. If Mangal is with strength,  
while in Bhojan Avastha, the native will eat sweet-food; if Mangal is  
devoid of strength, while in Bhojan Avastha, the native will indulge in  
base acts and be dishonourable. If Mangal is in Nritya Lips Avastha, the  
native will earn wealth through the king and will be endowed with fullness  
of gold, diamonds, and corals in his house. If Mangal is in Kautuk  
Avastha the native will be curious in disposition and will be endowed  
with friends and sons; if Mangal is in Kautuk Avastha and simultaneously  
exalted, the native will be honoured by the king and the virtuous and he  
will be virtuous himself. If Mangal is in Nidr Avastha, the native will  
be short-tempered, devoid of intelligence and wealth; he will be wicked,  
fallen from virtuous path, and troubled by diseases. Should Mangal be in  
Upavesan Avastha in Lagn, the native will be extremely sinful, and he will  
incur several diseases; he will be indigent and not peaceful. If Upavesan  
Avastha occurs for Mangal in Dharm Bhava, the native will lose his whole  
wealth apart from his wife and progeny. Mangal in Netrapani Avastha in  
Lagn will give poverty and will destroy the native's wife and progeny; If  
Mangal is in Netrapani Avastha in other bhavas (i.e. in bhavas other than  
Tanu Bhava), this confers on the native all kinds of wealth and happiness  
from wife and children. The Dhan Bhava position or Yuvati Bhava position  
of Mangal in Netrapani Avastha will cause fear from lions and snakes,  
apart from giving earnings from lands. Furthermore, the native's wife  
will predecease him. Should Mangal be in Prakash Avastha in Putr or in  
Yuvati Bhava, the native will lose his wife and all children. If Mangal  
is placed in Putr Bhava in Prakash Avastha, and is yuti with Shani,

female. In other bhavas, other than Tanu Bhava, Mangal in Gaman Avastha  
will bring royal favours, leadership ,and luxuries of life. Mangal in  
Agaman Avastha will cause piles and diseases of the rectum. If Mangal  
is in Bhojan Avastha or in Sayan Avastha in Putr Bhava, or in Randhr  
Bhava, there will be untimely death for the native. In other bhavas,  
other than Putr and Randhr Bhava, Bhojan Avastha of Mangal will confer  
wealth. Should Mangal be in Nritya Lips Avastha and happens to be in  
Lagn, Dhan, Yuvati, or Karm Bhava, the native will receive all kinds of  
happiness; there will be miseries in abundance if Mangal is in Nritya  
Lips Avastha and placed in Randhr or Dharm Bhava, apart from incurring  
untimely death. In other bhavas (i.e. Sahaj, Bandhu, Putr, Ari, Labh,  
or Vyaya Bhava), Nritya Lips Avastha of Mangal will make the native  
akin to Kuber. Mangal in Yuvati or in Dharm Bhava in Kautuk Avastha  
will give several diseases and death of the first child and wife. In  
other bhavas (i.e. not in Yuvati or Dharm Bhava), Kautuk Avastha will  
confer scholarship, various kinds of wealth, two wives, and more female  
children. In Nidr Avastha, Mangal in Lagn, Dhan, Sahaj, Dharm, Karm,  
or Labh Bhava will give scholarship, foolishness, and poverty. Putr or  
Yuvati Bhava placement of Mangal in Nidr Avastha will give many miseries  
and many male children. Should Rahu join Mangal in Nidr Avastha in any  
bhava the native will have many wives, be miserable, and will suffer

not be bold in his acts, and he will be bereft of conjugal and progenic  
happiness. If Rahu is in Nritya Lips Avastha, the native will contract  
a serious disease which seems difficult to subdue, will have afflicted  
eyes, and will have fear from enemies. He will decline financially and  
righteously. If Rahu is in Kautuk Avastha, the native will be devoid of  
a position (or a place); he will be interested in others' females, and

135-146. Effects of Ketu's Avasthas at Birth: If Ketu is in Sayan  
Avastha in Mesh, Vrishabh, Mithun, or Kanya, there will be plenty of  
wealth; while if Ketu is in Sayan Avastha in other rashis (i.e. other  
rashis than Mesh, Vrishabh, Mithun, or Kanya), increased diseases  
will follow. If Ketu is in Upavesan Avastha the native will suffer  
from ulcers and will have fear from enemies, windy diseases, snakes,  
and thieves. Should Ketu be in Netrapani Avastha, the native will  
contract eye diseases, and will have fear from wicked people, snakes,  
enemies, and people of royal family. If Ketu is in Prakash Avastha, the  
native will be wealthy and righteous; he will live in foreign places;  
he will be enthusiastic and genuine; and he will serve the king. If  
Ketu is in Gaman Avastha, the native will be endowed with many sons,  
and abundant wealth; he will be scholarly, virtuous, charitable, and he  
will be excellent among men. If Ketu is in Agaman Avastha, the native  
will incur many diseases, will face loss of wealth, will hurt (others)  
with his teeth ('Danta Ghatin'); he will be a tale bearer and will blame  
others. If Ketu is in Sabh Avastha the native will be garrulous, very  
proud, miserly, licentious, and skilful in evil branches of learning. If  
Ketu is in Agam Avastha, the native will be a notorious sinner; he will  
enter into litigations with his relatives; he will be wicked, and he  
will be troubled by diseases and enemies. If Ketu is in Bhojan Avastha,  
the native will always be distressed with hunger, penury and diseases,  
and he will roam all over the earth. If Ketu is in Nritya Lips Avastha,  
the native will be distressed due to diseases, will have a floral mark  
on the eye (i.e. white of the pupil); he will be impertinent and wicked;  
and he will plan evils. If Ketu is in Kautuk Avastha, the native will seek  
union with dancing females (i.e. prostitutes); he will suffer positional

147. General Effects (up to sloka 155): O Brahmin, if a benefic grah is  
in Sayan Avastha, there will be benefic effects at all times according  
to the learned.  
  
148. If a malefic is in Bhojan Avastha, everything (related to the bhava  
concerned) will be destroyed and there is no need of a second thought.  
  
149. Should a malefic in Yuvati Bhava be in Nidr Avastha auspicious  
effects will follow, provided that there is no drishti from another  
malefic.  
  
150. Declare without a second thought auspicious effects following the  
location of a malefic in Putr Bhava, but only with Nidr Avastha or in  
Sayan Avastha.  
  
151. Untimely death due to royal wrath will come to pass if there is  
a malefic in Randhr Bhava in Nidr Avastha or in Sayan Avastha.  
  
152. If in the case of a malefic in Randhr Bhava in Nidr Avastha or  
Sayan Avastha, there happen to be a benefic drishti or the yuti of a  
benefic. (untimely) death will be in the river Ganges, i.e. Gangetic belt,  
shrines, etc..  
  
153. If there is a malefic in Karm Bhava in Sayan Avastha or Bhojan  
Avastha, the native will face many miseries on account of his own deeds.  
  
154. O excellent of the Brahmins, doubtlessly a Raj Yog will come to  
pass, if Chandr is in Karm Bhava in Kautuk Avastha or Prakash Avastha.  
  
155. Thus, the good and bad effects should be guessed assessing the  
strength and weakness of the grahas concerning all the bhavas.
