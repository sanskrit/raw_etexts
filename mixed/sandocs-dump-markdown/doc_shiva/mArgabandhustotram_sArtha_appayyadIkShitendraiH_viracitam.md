 मार्गबन्धुस्तोत्रम् अप्पय्यदीक्षितेन्द्रैः विरचितम्   
  
  
by N. Balasubramanian bbalu@satyam.net.in  
A short life sketch of Shri Appayya DikShita (1520-1593 AD)  
  
Shrimad Appayya DikShita was born at Adayapalam village, very near  
Arni, North Arcot District, Tamil Nadu in the year  
1520 AD. His father Shri Rangarajadhari was the son of Shri Acharya  
DikShita - also known as VakShasthalacharya who was in  
the court of Shri Krishnadevaraya. ``Appayya'' was an  
endearing form of his real name, Vinayaka Subramaniam.  
``The 16th century AD, in South India was an age of confusion  
when begotry and vigorous proselytism were rampant. Persecution   
of one sect by another with the help of the ruling dynasties  
was quite common. In such an age, the need was felt for a  
rare scholar with comprehensive vision and imagination, whose mission  
in life would be the reconciliation of the various creeds,  
cults and philosophies. Shri Appayya DikShita filled this essential  
need. He was a peace maker who pleade for harmony, tolerance   
and mutual goodwill and understanding at a time when people were  
quarrelling among themselves as to who was superior Vishnu or   
Shiva. (Dr. N. Ramesan IAS. Shri Appayya DikShita Page 3)  
``DikShitar's culture was at once profound, libeal and wide. His  
characteristic impartiality never failed him even in his out and  
out militant works.'' (A. V. Gopalachariar. Introduction to  
Varadarajastava 1927. P vI) DikShitar's learning, says Y. Mahalinga  
Shastri, was in the truest sense of the word encyclopaedic.   
  
अप्पय्यदीक्षितेन्द्रा-नशेषविद्यागुरूनहं वन्दे ।   
यत्कृतिबोधाबोधौ विद्वदविद्वद्विभाजकोपाधी ॥ (भट्टोजीदीक्षितः)  
  
Shri DikShita is the author of not less than 104 works and had enjoyed  
the patronage of King Chinna Bomma of Vellore. He  
was offered ``kanakAbhiSheka'' by this king in 1582AD. He was  
patronised by Chinna Thimma and Venkatapati also. He  
lived upto the ripe age of 73 years and spent his last days in  
Chidambaram.  
  
Some of his most famous works are Shivarka maNidIpikA, NyAya  
rakShAmaNI, siddhAnta lesha sa.ngraha, parimala, chAturmata  
sArasa.ngraha, yAdavabhyudaya vyAkhyA, varadarAjastava and  
kuvalayAnanda. His stotras are simple, popular and effective,  
for example, mArgabandhu stotram, durgAchandrakalA stuti,  
ApitakuchambA stava, hariharabheda stuti.  
  
Margabandhu stotram: This small hymn is about Lord Marga sahaya or  
Margabandhu of Virinchipuram, near Vellore,  
NA Dt., the family deity of DikShita. It is very effective when  
recited before and during journy to ward off accidents and  
ensure success.  
(The above life sketch is taken from the book Shrimad Appayya  
DikShita, published by Shrimad Appayya DikShitendrar  
Grantha Prakasana Samiti, Hyderabad.)

मार्गः = a way, road, path; बन्धुः = relative or any one  
associated, well wisher. So the word मार्गबन्धुः means one who  
comes along with you giving company and protection स्तोत्रम् Stotram  
is a hymn praising the Lord गुणसंकीर्तनात्मकं  
स्तोत्रम् (VS681) It talks about His qualities.  
  
Stotram: At this point it is relevant to say a few words about stotram. Our  
scriptures are explicit in saying that the Supreme Being is one.  
It is without name, form and any other attributes. It is called  
brahman in our scriptures. This is not its name but one of its many  
attributes बृहत्तमत्वात् That which is big is brahman. Since  
the adjective `big' is used simply without a noun to be qualified it  
implies that the bigness is unlimited. It is infinite and beyond  
time, space etc., unlike the objects and beings we see in the  
universe. The scriptures also aver that it is beyond our senses. The  
famous mantra from the Taittiriyopanishad (Anu IV) says  
that the brahman is beyond the reach of our mind and words यतो  
वाचो निवर्तन्ते अप्राप्य मनसा सह If so, how does a seeker  
think of it or pray to it? This is where our scriptures come to our  
help. They also describe the same God (who indeed is without a form  
or name) as having many forms and names. This helps a seeker to  
worship Him through prayers,  puja,  
pilgrimages to holy places etc.. So we have gods like Rama, Shiva,  
Durga etc.. The worship of the Lord with form and name is called  
(सगुण उपासना ) saguna (sa = with; guna = attributes;  
upAsanA = worship). The names and forms conceal the esoteric truths mentioned  
in the upanishads. Thus they, like a map, give us some idea of  
something which is very vast and cannot be grasped by our senses. The  
Lord graciously accepts the worship offered to Him in any form one  
may choose.  
Krishna says  
यो यो यां यां तनुं भक्तः श्रद्धयाऽर्चितुमिच्छति  ।  
तस्य तस्याचलां श्रद्धां तामेव विदधाम्यहम् । BG.7-21   
He says that in whatever form a devotee seeks to worship Him with  
faith He upholds that faith and makes it steady .  
स तया श्रद्धया युक्तः तस्याराधनमीहते ।  
लभते च ततः कामान् मयैव विहितान्हितान्। BG.7-22 .  
He adds that the devotee engages himself with faith in the worship  
(as said above)  and from that he obtains his  
desires which are really conferred by Me alone. These statements of  
the Lord lend validity and sanctity to the worship of God with name  
and form who indeed is without any name, form or attributes. Later on  
the Lord says  
तेषां सततयुक्तानां भजतां प्रीतिपूर्वकम् ।  
ददामि बुद्धिसंयोगं येन मामुपयान्ति ते। BG.10-10 .  
He assures that to such devotees who worship Him with love He will  
give the clear wisdom by which they will reach Him. In  
this manner the saguna upAsana acts as a stepping stone to nirguna  
upAsana and through that the realisation of God.  
  
Prahlada, the gem among the devotees, mentions nine kinds of  
devotion (BH .7-5-23).  The first two amongst these (viz.)  
श्रवणम् listening to the Lord's names and stories which bring  
out His glories and कीर्तनम् chanting them are the simplest and  
easiest to practise. These can be done by anyone irrespective of age,  
caste or gender. They are suitable for the  
young and energetic as well as the old and decrepit, a pundit and  
also the ignoramus. Thus they are suitable for all. It is possible that their very simplicity deceives one to imagine that they are  
less potent than the other kinds of devotion. This is not so.  
Our scriptures repeatedly assert that they can confer the highest  
benefits on the devotee. The vedas contain stotras like the  
Rudram, Shri suktam etc.. Our puranas contain many. In adddition our  
acharyas like Shri Shankara and other saints have composed soul-stirring compositions in many languages. All these are  
ideally suited for recitation.  
  
One remarkable common feature to be found in these stotras is that  
each one may be in praise of a differently named god like  
Rama or Shiva. It will praise the attributes of that deity (in saguna  
form). It will also refer to incidents to be found in the puranas.  
The Bhagvat Gita says that the Lord incarnates Himself from time to  
time to subdue the evil and protect the righteous people.  
The puranas contain details of the incarnations and the deeds  
performed by Him to fulfill His mission. Behind all the glorification they will refer to His nirguna (without attributes) aspect also.  
The composition may be in praise of Shri Rama or Devi but it  
will also talk of the God as the Supreme Being. This clearly shows  
that the composer of the stotra was in fact praising the  
formless reality using the form of Shri Rama or Devi as a front. We  
can see this being done in this stotram also.  
  
There is one more point to note regarding stotras. Poets have sung  
praises of nobles and kings for pecuniary gains. But these men and  
kings, howsoever great or rich they may be, are only human. They  
have their limitations and weaknesses. In view of this a  
poem in praise of a person has necessarily to overlook the subject's  
foibles, exaggerate whatever virtues are to be found and if necessary  
innovate virtues! Exactly opposite is the case with God. He is pure  
and without limitations. As said earlier He is  
beyond the reach of the mind and words. So those who have composed  
stotrams in praise of the Lord have invariably felt  
severely handicapped because of their own limitations. We find such  
verses confessing the feelings of inadequacy even in the compositions  
of great acharyas like Shri Shankara and Shri Vedanta Desika .  
  
Now let us go to the Margabhandhu Stotram proper .  
      शंभो महादेव देव शिव  
      शंभो महादेव देवीश शंभो -  
      शंभो महादेव देव ॥   
The stotram begins with the recitation of the holy names of the Lord.  
The recitation of the Lord's names purifies the mind,  
makes it calm and fit for any serious undertaking. So they are  
normally repeated before commencing any work like pooja,  
religious discourse etc. Here one may recall the familiar verses  
recited at the time of commencing puja or any religious ceremony .  
  
अपवित्रः पवित्रो वा सर्वावस्थां गतोऽपि वा  ।  
यः स्मरेत् पुण्डरीकाक्षं सः बाह्याभ्यन्तरः शुचिः । ।  
मानसं वाचिकं पापं कर्मणा समुपार्जितम् ।  
श्रीरामस्मरणेनैव व्यपोहति न संशयः । ।  
श्री राम राम  राम ॥   
These verses say ``Anyone - may be impure or pure or whatever  
may be his condition - if just thinks of th lotus -eyed Lord is  
certainly pure inside and out. Sins commited by mind, speech or  
action go away by thinking of Shri Rama. This is  
certain.''  Thus the chanting of the Lord's names flushes out the  
impurities in the mind and invigorates it. The author can  
then look to the successful completion of the work taken on hand - in  
this case the composing of the hymn. Happily these  
names may be taken to apply to both to Shiva and Vishnu. They may be  
seen in the sahasranamams of both Shiva and Vishnu.  
  
SHAMBHU शम्भुः । शं सुख़ं भावयतीति शंभुः (SS-74:    
VS-38) He blesses his devotees with happiness and prosperity शं  
= happiness, prosperity. All being go through the repeated cycle of  
birth and death. They experience varities of sufferings during each  
life. During the dissolution of the universe He withdraws all beings  
within Himself - out of mercy -  and after some time He releases them  
again at the beginning of the next kalpa so that they get relief and  
respite.  
  
यतः सर्वाणि भूतानि भवन्त्यादियुगागमे। यस्मिंश्च  
प्रलयं यान्ति पुनरेव युगक्षये। VS-11  
``From whom all beings come at the beginning of the kalpa and  
into whom they again merge at the end of the kalpa.'' This  
implies that they are also sustained by Him during the period in  
between. This is mentioned in the TU (3-1).  
  
यतो वा इमानि भूतानि जायन्ते येन जातानि जीवन्ति यत्  
प्रयन्त्यभिसंविशन्ति   
``From whom all these beings emanate, by whom they stay alive and  
into whom they merge after death.''  
  
MAHADEVA महादेवः - महांश्चासौ देवश्च महादेवः । महत्वं  
च सकलपूज्यत्वाद्वा विभुत्वेन प्रमाणतो महत्वाद्वा He is  
worshipped by everyone. Also He is great because He pervades every  
thing.(SS22) सर्वान् भावन् परित्यज्य आत्मज्ञानयोगैश्वर्ये महति  
महीयते तस्मादुच्यते महादेवः (VS492)He is called Mahadeva  
because of His superior knowledge and His greatness as the gretest of  
the yogis. Shivarahasya says that the sound ``Mahadeva  
Maha-deva'' is a divine medicine for those bitten by the serpent  
called samsara महादेव महादेव महादेवेत्ययं ध्वनिः  
संसारसर्प-दष्टानां दिव्यौषधमनुत्तमम्।   
  
DEVA देवः - स्वामिपर्यायो देवशब्दः, नरदेव इतिवत्।  
अकुंचितस्वामित्वं च शिवस्यैव The word deva indicates  
lordship. His lordship is unrestricted दिव्यतेर्देवः (SA93)  
He is effulgent. Krishna says '' I am the splendour of those who  
possess splendour,'' तेजस्तेजस्विनामहम् BG(10-36)  
Accordingly, तमेव भान्तमनुभाति सर्वं तस्य भासा  
सर्वमिदं विभाति KU(2-2-15). All these (the sun, the moon, the  
stars, the lightning and fire) shine only after Him. It is with the  
infinitesimal part of His luminosity that all these shine.  
  
तेजोमूर्तिः SS413 and अमिततेजाः SS34 are His names. In the  
course of teaching of Gita at KurukShetra, Arjuna requests Krishna  to  
show him His cosmic form as Iswara. The gracious  
Lord obliges and reveals His universal form. Arjuna is overwhelmed by  
the splendour of the form he sees. He feels as though  
a thousand suns had risen at once in the sky दिवि  
सूर्यसहस्रस्य भवेद्युगपदुत्थिता। यदि भाः सदृशी सा  
स्याद्भासस्तस्य महात्मनः । (BG 9-12). Here, as is usual with  
the scriptures, thousand is only indicative and stands for many or  
infinite. This is a popular verse and is said to have been quoted by  
the scientist Oppenheimer to describe the explosion of the first atom  
bomb which he witnessed.  
  
Effulgence does not stand only for light. It also means wisdom. Shiva  
stands for infinite knowledge यः सर्वज्ञः सर्ववित् MU(1-9)  
One who is omniscient and knower of all द्युतिधरः  द्युतिं  
ज्ञानलक्षणां दीप्तिं धारयतीति द्युतिधरः VS(275)He bears  
the shine of knowledge दीप्तमूर्तिः दीप्ता ज्ञानमयी  
मूर्तिर्यस्येति दीप्तमूर्तिः VS(719) He is of the form of shining  
knowledge प्रकाशात्मा। प्रकाशस्वरूप आत्मा यस्य सः  
प्रकाशात्मा VS(276) His form is effulgent knowledge.  
  
SIVA शिवः - शिवः मङ्गलस्वरूपः ।  
निर्मृष्ट निखिलदुःखानुषङ्गपरमानन्दरूप इत्यर्थः ।   
Shiva is the personification of auspiciousness.  
He is completely free from sorrows  
that characterise all created beings including plants,  
animals, birds, humans and devas like Indra and even Brahama the  
creator. He is the embodiment of supreme bliss. (SS18)  
Also निस्त्रैगुणतया शुद्धत्वात् शिवः (VS27)He is devoid of  
the three qualities i.e. sattva(serenity), rajas(activity) and  
tamas(inertia). These qualities constitute ignorance (of Brahman or  
reality) and characterise all creation. So Shiva being free  
from these is pure. Patanjali sums up all this in his Yogadarsana  
(1-23) as क्लेशकर्मविपाकाशयैरपरामृष्टः  
पुरुषविशेषः ईश्वरः । क्लेशाः, अविद्या, अस्मिता, राग,  
द्वेष, अभिनिवेशा, कर्म धर्माधर्मौ, विपाकाः  
कर्मफलानि - जन्मायुर्भोगाः, आशयो ज्ञानादि- वाशनाः,  
एतैः कालत्रयेऽपरामृष्टः पुरुषविशेषः ईश्वरः इत्यर्थः ॥  
  
स्मृतिमात्रेण पावयन् शिवः He removes the sins of those who  
just think of His name. DakShayani says this to her father  
DakSha यद्व्यक्षरं नाम गिरेरितं नृणां सकृत्  
प्रसंगादघमाशु हन्ति The celebrated two syllables SIVA  
uttered with the tongue even once and that too casually, immediately  
wipes off the sins of those (who utter them).(BH 4.4.13)  
Shivarahasya says this about the sanctity of Lord Shiva's names:    
  
सर्वाणि शिवनामानि मोक्षदान्येव सर्वदा  ।  
तेष्वप्यत्युत्तमं नाम शिवेति ब्रह्मसंज्ञितम्। All the  
names of Shiva give mokSha no doubt. But amongst them the name  
Shiva is the best and denominates brahman. The  
name Shiva is considered as the best among the Lord's names .  
  
विद्यासु श्रुतिरुत्कृष्टा रुद्रैकादशनी श्रुतौ ।  
तत्र पञ्चाक्षरी तस्यां शिव इत्यक्षरद्वयम्।   
Of all the knowledge the vedas are superior. Among the vedas Shri  
Rudram that consists of sixteen chapters is superior. In that  
the PanchakShari is superior. In that also the two letters SIVA are  
the best. The glory of the Lord's names is  dealt with in great  
detail in Puranas and hymns of the saints.  
  
DEVESHA देवेशः - प्राधान्येन देवानामीशः देवेशः He is  
the foremost among the gods like Indra, Agni etc.. VS(492) सुरेशः  
- सुराणां देवानामीशः सुरेशः He is the lord of the  
devas. VS(85). He rules with a firm hand. None can dare to transgress  
His commandments without facing serious consequences .  
  
भीषास्मात् वातः पवते। भीषोदेति सूर्यः ।  
भीषास्मादग्निश्चेन्द्रश्च । मृउत्युर्धावति पञ्चमः   
TU(VII-1) It is for fear of Him that the wind blows; the sun rises;  
the fire and  Indra perform their duties. It is for fear of Him  
that death the fifth runs about doing his work with diligence. The  
same is said by none other than Yama, the lord of death:    
  
भयादस्याग्निस्तपति भयात् तपति सूर्यः  ।  
भयादिन्द्रश्च वायुश्च मृत्युर्धावति पञ्चमः । KU(3-3).  
  
Now let us go to the stotram proper. It consists of five verses and a  
sixth one - called फलश्रुतिः that gives the benefit of  
reciting the hymn. In this hymn Lord Margabandhu is described as the  
God with form as Shiva  bearing weapons, as the  
consort of Parvati. It refers to various incidents to be found in  
puranas that reveal His unrivalled power and glory. He is also  
praised in His aspect as the supreme reality, the attributeless  
brahman whose nature is existence, wisdom and bliss .  
  
      १. फालावनम्रत्किरीटं फालनेत्रार्चिषा दग्धपञ्चेषुकीटम्  ।  
      शूलाहतारातिकूटं, शुद्धमर्धेन्दुचूडं भजे मार्गबन्धुम्॥  
  
      शंभो ...  
फालः - forehead; अवनम्र - descended or come down;  
किरीटं - crown: indicates that Lord Shiva wears a crown on the  
head किरीटी - किरीटमस्यास्तीति किरीटी (SS782). The crown implies  
that Shiva wears other ornaments also हिरण्यः (SS273) and  
हिरण्यबाहुः (SS387) सुवर्णवर्णः -सुवर्णस्येव वर्णोऽस्येति  
सुवर्णवर्णः VS(737). One who is golden-hued and हेमाङ्गः -  
हेमेवाङ्गं वपुरसेति हेमाङ्गः VS(738) One with body like gold  
are also His names. Shri Rudram salutes Him saying नमो  
हिरण्यबाहवे।  
पादावनम्रत्किरीटं is another reading found in some  
books पादः = foot; implies that when gods like Indra bow down  
to salute Him their crowns touch His feet. The crown indicates  
lordship. Please see the comments on DEVESHA above.  He demands  
respect and in fact He is the only one to be respected पूज्यः ।  
पूजायोग्यः पूज्यः सर्ववन्द्य: इत्यर्थः SS(70) He deserves to  
be worshipped by all. There is none equal to or greater than Him says  
Shri Suka while saluting Him before he begins to narrate Bhagavatam to  
King ParikShit निरस्तसाम्यातिशयेन राधसा स्वधामनि  
ब्रह्मणि रंस्यते नमः BH(2-4-14)अतुलः - तुलोपमानमस्य  
न विद्यते इति अतुलः He has none equal to Him. VS(355)  
अनुत्तमः - अविद्यमान उत्तमो यस्मात् सः अनुत्तमः There is  
none greater than Him. VS (80). Further  
there is none superior to Him. VS(626) अनीशः - न  
विद्यतेऽस्येश इति अनीशः   
All other devas including Brahma the creator are limited by time and  
are subject to sorrows प्रथमः - देवानां प्रधानभूत आद्यो  
वा प्रथमः He is the first and foremost among the devas.  
SS(111). Shri Rudram says He is the foremost and is the inner self of  
the devas प्रथमो दैव्यः Such is His glory   
  
फालनेत्रार्चिषा दग्धपञ्चेषुकीटं - नेत्रं = eye:    
अर्चिस् = fire: दग्ध = burnt: इषुः = arrow: कीटः = a  
worm, insect पञ्चेषुः is the name  Manmatha, the god of  
love, because he has five arrows: they are अरविन्दं, अशोकं,  
चूतं, नवमल्लिका and नीलोत्पलम्(lotus, ashoka, mango,  
jasmine and blue lotus). The five arrows are also said to be  
संमोहनः , उन्मादनः, शोषणः, तापनः and   
स्तम्भनः They are fascination, intoxication or extravagance of  
love, emaciation, suffering pain and benumbing or stupifying  
respectively. Kalidasa vividly narrates the story connected with Shiva  
destroying the god of love in his mastepiece Kumarasambhavam.  
Manmatha shot his arrow संमोहनं at Shiva who was deep in  
meditation. He wanted to seduce Shiva's mind and make Him fall in love  
with Parvati who was attending on Him, but failed in his attempt.  
Shiva could sense that something was amiss and looked about. He saw  
Manmatha cowering at a distnce. He just knit his brows in annoyance.  
In that moment fire shot out of His third eye and  
reduced the wretched Manmatha into a handful of ashes. Manmatha is  
contemptuously termed a worm or insect as he  
was foolish enough to try his tricks on none other than the great  
Shiva. So Shiva is known as कामारिः - कामस्य मन्मथस्य अरिः  
कामारिः SA(25)  
  
Leaving the story apart, the implication is that there is no place  
for carnal desires in the prescence of the Lord; just like there is  
no place for darkness in the prescence of the sun. By the same  
logic,there will be no place for evil tendencies in the heart of a  
devotee who establishes the Lord therein.  
  
Shiva's third eye is situated in His forehead. So Shiva is known as  
फालनेत्रः SS(159) and ललाटाक्षः SA(28) It is to be  
noted that the third eye is unique. None of the human beings and gods  
including Indra and the creator Brahma possess such  
an eye. So Shiva is also known as विरूपक्षः । विरूपाणि  
विरुद्धस्वरूपाणि लोकविरुद्धत्रित्वविशिष्टानि अक्षीणि यस्य सः  
विरूपाक्षः । SS(129).  He has an abnormal third eye. The third  
eye situated in a high position (viz) forehead and stands for supreme  
knowledge उन्नतस्थानवर्तिलोचनशालित्वकीर्तनेन  
विश्वोत्तरज्ञानशालित्वं सूचितम् SA(28). With such an eye He  
could easily look into the inmost recesses of anyone's heart and  see  
the thoughts lurking there. So He could detect by a mere glance  that  
the god of love has come to His prescence with an evil thought and  
meted out severe punishment.  
  
The Shiva-Mahimna stotram (15) says that for his foolishness Manmatha  
paid a heavy price with his life and became an  
object of memory स्मरः स्मर्तव्यात्मा न हि वशिषु पथ्यः  
परिभवः । स्मर Smara is another name of Manmatha. His arrows  
have not failed anywher in the world of gods, demons and men. So he  
became conceited. Smara  became (स्मर्तव्यात्मा) an object of  
memory. The moral of the story, says the poem, is that an insult to  
the great will  
produce serious consequences वन्हिनेत्रः - वन्हिनेत्रं ललाटे  
यस्य सः वन्हिनेत्रः (SS131) is also one of Shiva's names.  
Bhartrihari in his Vairagya Satakam refers to this incident thus:    
लीलादग्ध-विलूलकाम शलभः (i.e.) who effortlessly burnt  
up the flippant god of love as a moth. A big fire instantly reduces  
a moth into ashes.  
  
शूलः = the Trident of Shiva; आहत = struck; अरातिः = enemy;   
कूटं = mass, heap: Shiva has destroyed His enemies with  
His Trident. But Shiva has no enemies समोऽहं सर्वभूतेषु न मे  
द्वेष्योऽस्ति न प्रियः (BG9-29) ``I am the same to all beings.  
There is none hateful or dear to me'' says the Lord in Gita. So  
we have to take  ``enemies'' to mean the enemies of His  
devotees. We find that during the Mahabharata war Lord involved  
Himself to help His devotee Arjuna. During the KurukShetra war Arjuna  
was struk with wonder to see a figure radiant like the sun  going  
ahead of him. The figure destroyed  
his enemies very easily with His trident. Arjuna tells this to sage  
Vyasa and asks who that radiant figure was. He adds that  
people think he has killed his enemies so valiantly though all the  
work was done by that figure. Vyasa says ``You have seen  
Lord Shiva.'' ईशानमीश्वरं देवं दृष्टवानसि  
शङ्करम् Krishna confirms this and says ``Your enemies have  
already been killed by Me. Be a mere instrument.'' BG(11-33)  
मयैवैते निहिताः पूर्वमेव निमित्तमात्रं भव  
सव्यसाचिन्   
  
The more dangerous ``enemies'' a devotee has to face are  
internal such as desire, anger etc.. In reply to Arjuna's question as  
to  
what impels a person to commit sins even though he may be unwilling,  
Krishna says काम एष क्रोध एष रजोगुणसमुद्भवः । महाशनो  
महापाप्मा विद्ध्येनमिह वैरिणम्। BG(3-37) ``It is desire.  
It is  anger. They are born out of rajo guna. It has huge appetite  
and makes one to commit sins. Recognise it as your enemy.'' And  
later on BG(16-21)  
He describes these as open gateways to hell that will destroy the  
self. He cautions Arjuna to be careful and avoid them. So a devotee  in order to avoid these internal enemies installs Him in his heart  
and feels safe. Krishna tells Uddhava that once He  
is established in the heart evil tendencies like desires get  
destroyed कामा हृदय्या नश्यन्ति सर्वे मयि हृदि स्थिते BH(11-21-26).  
They cannot live together like light and darkness.  He  
is called कामहा - कामान् हन्ति मुमुक्षूणां भक्तानां  
हिंसकानां चेति कामहा He destroys the desires of His  
devoteees who seek liberation and the  
intentions of those who trouble them. VS(294). Also कामनाशः ।  
मुमुक्षूणां कामं नाशयतीति कामनाशः SS(126). Lord  
Shiva is the आदि गुरुः the earliest or the first guru. He teaches  
by demonstration. He shows He has destroyed His desires and wants His  
devotee to do likewise. He is only too willing to help him provided he  
makes his heart His temple. In view of this Bhartruhari describes a  
sadhu whose heart is pure as having devotion to Shiva with trident  
भक्तिः शूलिनि   
  
Unfortunately a devotee has to contend with one more  
``enemy'' - more pernicious than the enemies mentioned in the  
preceding  
para. It is attachment. Desire is a longing to possess something  
which we do not have and we feel that thing can give us satis faction or pleasure or security. We try to get that thing and when  
someone or something thwarts the desire the desire turns into anger.  
Thus desire precedes anger or anger is the result of frustrated  
desire. Once the object of desire is got and is in our possession we  
tend to hold on to it. This inclination to bind ourselves to objects  
or people around us is known as attachment.  
We look to those objects or people to give us pleasure or security.  
Vedanta warns us to avoid getting attached to things or  
people; because firstly the objects of attachment are perishable as  
anything in the world is. If we develop strong attachment to  
something, then parting with it can be a very painful experience and  
we may sink under the load of the resultant grief. That was the case  
with Dasaratha who was excessively attached to his son Rama. He could  
not bear the pangs of separation from Rama  
who had to leave for the forest for fourteen years. He died in agony.  
  
Secondly it is wrong to look to such objects or people for security  
as they are perishable and so are themselves insecure.  
Hence they cannot confer security on us. We will be left in the  
lurch. Attachment is called (ईषणा ) IshanA. Three types of  
attachments are mentioned in our scriptures. They are attachment to  
(1) the money (2) wife/husband and (3) children. Further  
it is said that attachment, once developed to something, is very  
difficult to get rid of. It is like a blob of coaltar that has some how got stuck to our body. It will take a long time and repeated  
washing to get rid of it. So we are warned to be wary of  
developing attachment to anything or any person. This does not  
prevent us from showing love to others.  
  
Prahlada gives a description of these attachments (BH .7-6) in his  
advice to his friends. Talking about the attachment to money  
he says को न्वर्थतृष्णां विसृजेत् प्राणेभ्योऽपि य ईप्सितः ।  
यं क्रीणात्यसुभिः प्रेष्ठैस्तस्करः सेवको वणिक्। (BH  
97-8-10) He says that money is valued higher than life itself and so  
who can give up attachment to it? The thief, the soldier and the  
merchant trade their dear life for money. In view of this he warns  
all to stay away from the objects of attachment and seek the Lord.  
The boy Nachiketa said न वित्तेन तर्पणीयो मनुष्यः He said  
man can never get satiated with the wealth  when Yama offered him  
immense wealth in exchange for the teaching about self.  
  
Kunti, the mother of Pandavas, in her prayer to Krishna before He  
leaves for Dwaraka says स्नेहपाशमिमं छिन्धि दृढं  
पाण्डुषु वृष्णिषु। She prays to the Lord to cut her attachment  
to her relatives so that her mind can think of Him without  
distractions. BH(1-8-41)  
  
The foregoing introduction is to explain the other implication of  
shula or the trident of Shiva. The three sharp points of the trident  
can destroy the three kinds of attachment that can assail a devotee  
and hinder his progress.  
  
The devotee shakes off his attachments to the worldly objects first.  
This was what Vibhishana did before surrendering to  
Rama. As the brother of Ravana and his minister he was very  
powerful. He was immensely rich. He had palaces, loving wives  
and children. But he gave up every thing and rushed to Rama without  
even taking leave of his wife and children. He said त्यक्त्वा  
पुत्रांश्च दारांश्च राघवं शरणं गतः Renouncing  
my wives and children I have surrendered to Raghava and again   
परिक्त्यक्ता मया लङ्का मित्राणि च धनानि च Lanka,  
friends and all wealth had been left behind by me.  
(Ramayana-Yuddhakanda-17-16 and 19-6).  
Then he transfers his  attachment to the Lord and enshrines Him in  
his heart. Then the devotee ties His feet firmly with the cord  
of love and so He becomes immobilised प्रणयरशनया  
धृथाङ्घ्रिपद्मः BH(11-2-55). Thus firmly stationed in the  
devotee's heart He destroys the evil tendencies therein  
हृद्यन्तस्थो ह्यभद्राणि विधुनोति सुहृत्सताम् BH(1-2-17)  
शूलहस्तः - शूलं हस्ते यस्य  सः (SS114): जितशत्रुः -  
जिताः शत्रवः येन सः जितशत्रुः (SS211) and रिपुघ्नः -  
सुररिपून् हन्तीति रिपुघ्नः (SS370) are Shiva's names.  
  
Further it is said त्रैगुण्यं शूलमेतस्य - एवं भूतस्य  
शूलस्य करस्थत्वोक्त्या त्रिगुणात्मिकाया मायाया  
स्वाधीनत्वमुक्तं भवति SA(11) The trident represents the  
three gunas (traits). Shiva holding it in His hand shows He is in  
contol of maya of which they are the constituents.  
  
शुद्धं = कालत्रयेऽपि परमार्थतः मायाऽविद्यादि  
संबन्धरहितः शुद्धः । शुद्धमपापविद्धं इति  
श्रुतिः (SS310) Forever He is free from maya (the illusion by which  
one considers the unreal universe as really existent and as distinct  
from the Supreme Spirit) and spiritual ignorance. This is made  
explicit by what is said about the moon next.  
  
अर्धेन्दुचूडं - अर्ध = half इन्दुः = the moon चूड = crest,  
Shiva has partial moon on the crest सोमविभूषः -  
विशिष्टा भूषा विभूषा, सोमः विभूषा भूषणं यस्य सः  
सोमविभूषः चन्द्रधरः (SS32) and also शशिमौलिः =   
शशी चन्द्रः मौलौ यस्य सः शशिमौलिः (SS929)The moon  
appears as a  special ornament to Shiva शशिशेखरः - अयं  
चन्द्रः परमेश्वरस्य ज्ञानरूप इति शिवागमे  
दर्शितम्।यतोक्तं `` ज्ञानचन्द्रकलाचूडं।'' SA(5).  
The moon represents His infinite wisdom. Please see notes under Deva  
above. It is to be noted that the crown  that Shiva wears does not  
cover the moon. This implies that Shiva's lordship  
over the universe - His omnipotence - does not veil His wisdom. The  
shining moon announces to the world that one who  
yearns for knowledge should come to Him. Shankaracharya says in his  
Prasnottara ratnamalika को हि जगद्गुरुरुरुक्तः? शंभुः,  
ज्ञानं कुतः? शिवादेव। Who is the universal teacher? Shambu.  
From where  can one get wisdom? From Shiva only. So we have the saying  
ज्ञानमिच्छेत् महेश्वरात् '' One should pray to Maheswara  
for wisdom.''  
  
भजे =  worship: मार्गबन्धुं = the Lord Margabandu.  
I worship Lord Margabandu who wears a crown, who destroyed the insect  
like god of love with the fire from His eye in His  
forehead, who destroyed  the enemies (of gods) with His Trident, who  
is pure(i.e.) beyond maya and ignorance and who  
wears the moon on His head as an onament.  
  
      २. अङ्गे विराजद्भुजङ्गं  
      अभ्रगङ्गातरङ्गाभिरामोत्तमाङ्गं  
      ओंकारवाटीकुरङ्गं सिद्धसंसेविताङ्घ्रिं  
      भजे मार्गबन्धुम् । शंभो ...  
अङ्गे विराजद्भुजङ्गं   -  
अंगं = limb; may mean hand, or leg; विराजत् = shining or  
appearing prominently; भुजंगः = serpent, snake;  
Lord Shiva is decked with snakes सर्पभूषः - सर्पाः भुजगाः  
भूषाः भूषणानि यस्य सः सर्पभूषः (SS43) His other names  
are सर्पहारः: सर्पाः नागाः, ते हाराः यस्य सः (SS494)  
and नागचूडः - नागो वासुकिः कोटीरबन्धनार्थं चूडायां  
यस्य सः नागचूडः (SS736). Shiva wears a garland of snakes and  
has tied Vasuki -the king of snakes - around His head to keep His  
locks of hair in place.  
  
Snakes:-  
We fear snakes because we identify them with death. And everyone is  
afraid of death कस्माद्भ्यमिह? मरणात् says  
Sankaracharya in his Prasnottara ratnamalika. The symbolism is used  
in our scriptures frequently. For example: ग्रस्तं  
कालाहिनाऽऽत्मानं कोऽन्यस्त्रातुमधीश्वरः BH(11.8.41)  
meaning ``who else, other than the Lord can save  one seized by  
the serpent of Time ? When Gajendra, the lord of the elephants was  
seized by a crocodile and found that he could  
not extricate himself from its grip he called the Lord saying  
यः कश्चनेशो बलिनोऽन्तकोरगात् प्रचण्डवेगादभिधावतो भृशम् ।  
भीतं प्रपन्नं परिपाति यद्भयान्मृत्युः प्रधावत्यरणं तमीमहि। BH(8.2.33)   
He says ``Whosoever be the almighty God, who protects one, who has  
surrendered to Him being very much afraid of  the  
powerful snake in the form of Death - that is very fast and is after  
him - and from fear of whom Death  himself runs hither and  
thither, let us seek Him as our refuge.''  
  
Kala means the Supreme principle which devours everything and Yama  
the god of death who is also known by the names  
Antaka and Mrutyu. So at level one He is Yama मृत्युः  
सर्वहरश्चाहम् Krishna says ``I am Death who seizes all  
life.'' BG(10.34)  He is Antaka अन्तकः - अन्तं करोति  
भूतानामिति अन्तकः VS(520). He causes the end of all life.  
At the higher level He is the kala or Supreme principle which  
destroys everything including Yama, the god of death at the time of  
dissolution. Lord Kapila gives a description of Kala to His mother  
Devahuti. BH(3.29. 36-45). He says it is none other than  
Vishnu who draws everything into Himself कालः - कलयति  
सर्वमिति कालः, - कालः कलयतामहम् - गीता १०.३० इति  
भगवद्वचनात् VS(418) and SS(33). The Lord is not limited by  
time or space or by any material अनन्तात्मा। देशतः कालतो  
वस्तुतश्चापरिच्छिन्नत्वात् अनन्तात्मा VS(518). He is not  
subject to destruction or anything that causes destruction.  
अमृत्युः । मृत्युर्विनाशः तद्धेतुर्वास्य न विद्यते इति  
अमृत्युः VS(198). In fact it is He - the seer and all knowing  who had created the gods (including Yama) and assigned to them their  
duties says Isavasyopanishad.  
कविर्मनीषी परिभूः स्वयंभूः  
यथातथ्यतोऽर्थान्व्यदधाच्छाश्वतीभ्यः समाभ्यः   
So the snakes, representing kala or death, cannot harm Him but He  
wears them implying He uses Death for His services.  
Yama himself says मृत्युर्यस्योपसेचनम् Death to Him is like  
pickles or achAr - a thing He uses in the process of consumig the  
creation. KU(1.3.25). Remember that one uses a small quantity of pickle  
only to push in a large amount of food  
- the main dish. Similarly the Lord uses the services of Yama in a  
small measure for His main work.  
कालहन्ता। कालस्य मृत्योर्हन्ता SS(83) and कालकालः ।  
कालः यमः, तस्यापि कालः, . SA(29) are His names. He  
destroyed even Yama, the god of death to protect His devotee  
Markandeya. The name also indicates that He is the supreme Lord who  
withdraws everything , the entire creation, including the god of  
death into Himself at the time of dissoluton  
and releases them again at the beginning of the next cycle of  
creation. His other names are मृत्युंजयः - मृत्युः मरणं  
स्वभक्तानां मृत्युं जयति, स्वोपासनादिना परिहरति इति  
मृत्युंजयः SS(123), SA(71). He removes or avoids the death of  
His devotees. The sage Markandeya confidently sings  
चन्द्रशेखरमाश्रये मम किं करिष्यति वै यमः ``I  
take refuge in Lord Shiva . What harm can Yama do to me?'' This is  
also said symbolically in the story of Dhruva. Towards the end of  
the story it is said that a chariot came to take him to the place  
reserved for him in the skies. The Lord had told him that it was a  
special place because there will be no return to this world again  
meaning he had crossed death and will not be reborn. At that time  
Yama - the god of death - approached him and bowed down. Dhruva  
stepped on Yama's head and climbed into the vehicle .  
तदोत्तानपादः पुत्रो ददर्शान्तिकमागतम् ।  
मृत्यो-र्मूर्ध्नि पदं दत्त्वा आरुरोहाद्भुतं गृहम्। BH(4.12.30)  
  
At this point let us take a small detour and see what our scriptures  
have to say on the subject of life and kala or death.  This  
may sound a bit morbid : but since it is literally a matter of life  
and death we should know some details.  
  
One who is born has to die and one who dies is reborn जातस्य हि  
ध्रुवो मृत्युः ध्र्वं जन्म मृतस्य च BG(2.27).  
From this it appears that this is a never ending process. One can  
view it in either of the two ways as follows.  
1 - One does not believe in the existence of the other world. There  
is no inclination to think about or enquire into the process.  
Such people are known as Nastikas.  
2 - This one - known as Astika - believes in the shastras and the  
existence of the other world. He tries to find a way out of it.  
  
The shastras say that the people coming under the first category are  
to be pitied. The human birth is superior to other forms of births.  
Only humans are endowed with free will and ability to discriminate  
between the right and the wrong: the good and the  
bad. Only they have the ability to work for their own and other's  
uplift. The animals do not have free will. Their life is governed  
by instincts. Because of this they do not incur any sin for their  
actions. One obtains a human birth after going through the  
inferior births and as a result of some good deeds and blessings of  
the Lord. It is therefore incumbent on us to use this  
privileged position to our advantage and seek higher goals including  
liberation from death. But if one fails to seize the rare  
opportunity that has come his way but fritters his life on petty  
sense pleasures and garnering pelf he falls from his status and  
is considered an ignoramus.  BH(11.7.74)  
    यः प्राप्य मानुषं लोकं मुक्तिद्वारमपावृतम्।  
गृहेषु खगवत्सक्तस्तमारूढच्युतं विदुः ।   
  
The question of escaping death has been discussed again and again in  
our scriptures. We will structure the discussion as  
answers to the following questions.  
1 - What leads to rebirth?  
2 - What is wrong with rebirth or why rebirth is to be avoided?  
3 - What is the process called death? and  
4 - Can death be avoided and if so how to avoid death?  
  
1 - What leads to rebirth?  
Everyone has to work, at least to keep the wolf from the door. In  
addditon people work to improve their standard of living, to  
provide for the rainy day, old age etc. All these activities - called  
karma - can be classified as good or bad. The good ones are  
those that are enjoined by our scriptures and those that can be  
called virtuous, selfless and such. The bad ones are those that  
are prohibited by our scriptures and those that are motivated by  
greed, anger, selfishness etc. Both acts produce results which  
are to be ``enjoyed'' by the doer .  
स्वकर्मणोऽनुरूपं हि फलं भुञ्जति जन्तवः  ।  
शुभेन कर्मणा भूतिर्दुःखं स्यात्पातकेन तु। Skanda Puranam.  
The good deeds produce happiness, prosperity etc. and lead to higher  
births - life of better quality and happiness in  
this world or higher worlds. The bad deeds produce unhappiness,  
misery etc.  By neglecting to do the duties expected of him  
and also doing acts that are prohibited he falls and is thrown into  
inferior births.  
 विहितस्याननुष्ठानात् निन्दितस्य च सेवनात्।  
अनिग्रहाच्चेन्द्रियाणां नरः पतनमृच्छति। (Yagnavalkya  
Smrithi) Then he climbs up the ladder slowly and gets the human birth  
again after a long time says Lord as Kapila to His mother Devahuti.  
अधस्तान्नरलोकस्य यावतीर्यातनादयः । क्रमशः  
समनुक्रम्य पुनरत्राव्रजेच्छुचिः । BH(3.31.34)  
Yama - the god of death - tells the same to Nachiketa: ``One who  
is infatuated with wealth; not having a thought for the other  
world; such an ignorant person believing there is no such thing as  
hell or heaven comes within my clutches again and again.''  
न साम्परायः प्रतिभाति बालं प्रमाद्यन्तं वित्तमोहेन मूढम् ।  
अयं लोको नास्ति पर इति मानी पुनः पुनर्वशमापद्यते मे। KU(1.2.6)   
So the doer of the deeds has to be prepared to enjoy or suffer the  
fruits. If the fruits cannot be exhausted in one lifetime one  
has to take another birth and try to exhaust them.  
The problem, according to our shastras is, that everyone of us had  
taken countless number of births, done karmas in these  
births and accumulated vast amounts of the karmas. This accumulated  
store waiting to bear fruit  
is called संचितं कर्मा sanchitam karma.  
In addition we continue to do karma in this life  
also and add to the stock of sanchitam karma thus necessi tating more and more births. Out of this vast stock a chunk begins to  
yield the results. This chunk is called प्रारब्धम् prarabdham.  
There is no escape from the results of the prarabdham. It determines  
the duration of life, the wealth, education  
and the mode of death even as one is born आयुः कर्म च वित्तं  
च विद्या निधनमेव च। पञ्चैतानि विविच्यन्ते जायमानस्य  
देहिनः । We have to infer the impressions of the past deeds only  
when we are confronted with the results. Kalidasa says this  in  
Raghuvamsa (1.20) फलानुमेयाः प्रारंभाः संस्काराः  
प्राक्तना इव   
  
2 - What is wrong with rebirth or why rebirth is to be avoided?  
If one asks what is wrong with being born, saints like Shri Shankara  
want us to think and find out if anything is right with it?किं  
संसारे सारं ? बहुशोपि विचिन्त्यमानमिदमेव(Prasnottara  
ratnamalika). If one were to think that Shankara  was a sanyasi and so  
had such a dark view of life, so did Bhartruhari and Kulasheakhara who  
were  kings and had access to all kinds of pleasures न  
संसारोत्पन्नं चरितमनुपश्यामि कुशलं (Bhartruhari Vairagya Shatakam).  
  
The problems start right from the beginning. Sage Kapila points out  
that nothing can equal the pain one suffers while in the  
womb गर्भवाससमं दुःखं न भूतं न भविष्यति BH(3.31.9).  
Then look at the troubles one goes through as he  
grows up. As one runs around earning and looking after his family one  
is  assailed by worries and sickness. He is all the time  growing old  
imperceptibly.  
व्याघ्रीव तिष्ठति जरा परितर्जयन्ती, रोगाश्च शत्रव  
इव प्रहरन्ति देहम् says Bartruhari in his Vairagya shatakam. He says that old age is crouching there like a tigress  
frightening us, and diseases attack our bodies like enemies.  
Then there is the fear of the inevitable death. In view of all these  
Krishna describes rebirth as the seat of pain and impermanent.  
पुनर्जन्म दुःखालयमशाश्वतम् BG(7.15) Later on He again  
says this world is impermanent and joyless अनित्यमसुखं  
लोकमिमं BG(9.33). We clearly see that everything in this world  
is impermanent. This includes our bodies, our relations, friends and  
possessions. The question then is how can one feel happy when thrown  
into such a situation? Time is constantly gnawing at our life  
quietly. Bhartruhari says life is oozing away like water leaking from  
a pot with a crack आयुः परिस्रवति भिन्नघटादिवांभः   
Death is imminent and can strike anyone at any time. This being the  
case, Krishna asks ``how can one find pleasure in wealth or  
enjoyment? It cannot please him, who like an animal, is being dragged  
to be slaughtered.''  
BH(11.10. 20)कोन्वर्तः सुखयत्येनं कामो वा मृत्युरन्तिके।  
आघातं नीयमानस्य वध्यसेव न तुष्टिदः ।   
Next, Krishna said this world is joyless. This is because the  
pleasures are transitory. They have a beginning and an end and so  
are fleeting by nature. Their departure may leave a void and a trail  
of sorrow. Or they may make one to hanker for more of it  
and leave him restless and unhappy. So He says that one endowed with  
discrimination will not enjoy them ये हि संस्पर्शजा भोगाः  
दुःखयोनय एव ते । आद्यन्तवन्तः कौन्तेय न  
तेषु रमते बुधः । BG(9.22) Such sensory  
pleasures are trivial and cannot be termed as  
pleasures in the true sense.  
  
In view of what is stated here, rebirth is not desireable and one  
should, if possible, avoid it.  
  
3 - What is the process called death?  
This is mentioned briefly in clinical fashion in the  
Brihadaranyopanishad. It says that as the end approaches the  
individual's  
breathing becomes hard and he starts gasping. His pranas, along with  
the sense organs, withdraw from their respective foci and  
gather around jivatma - the individual soul. As he (jiva) departs,  
the pranas and the sense organs follow him. He gets a body as  
in a dream and enters another body. The impressions of his karma and  
the knowledge about brahman that he had acquired in  
that birth also follow him. He gets a body suitable to his karma in  
this world or some other world .  
एवमेवात्मानमन्तकाले सर्वे प्रणाः अभिसमायान्ति  
यत्रैतदूर्ध्व्वोच्छ्वासी भवति। (4.3.38)  
तमुत्क्रामन्तं प्राणोऽनूत्क्रामति प्राणमनूत्क्रामन्तं  
सर्वे प्राणा अनूत्क्रामन्ति सविज्ञानो भवति   
सविज्ञा मेवान्ववक्रामति तं विद्याकर्माणि समन्वारभेते पूर्वप्रज्ञा च। (4.4.2)  
 अयमात्मेदं शरीरं निहत्याविद्यां  
गमयित्वान्यन्नवतरं कल्याणतरं रूपं कुरुते(4.4.4)  
Krishna says that the knowledge he had aquired in the earlier birth  
carries him forward in his next birth and he progresses in  
the spiritual path. He does not have to start ab initio.  
पूर्वाभ्यासेन तेनैव ह्रियते ह्यवसोऽपि सः BG(6.44)  
Some puranas describe it in detail making it sound a bit scary. Sage  
Kapila gives a description in His talk to His mother. This  
is on the same lines as stated above in the upanishad. He says that  
the individual soul living in the gross body has, in addition, a subtle  
body called Linga Shariram or SukShma Sariram which is invisible. It  
is made up of seventeen components (viz.) the five sense organs of  
perception (called gnanendriyas), the five sense organs of action  
(called karmendriyas), the five pranas, the  
mind and the intellect. It requires the gross physical body for  
functioning. It does not perish when the gross body perishes in  
the process called death which takes place at the end of prarabdham  
karma. The Jiva just migrates to another body (called  
birth) with the Linga Shariram according to the nature of past karmas  
and generates new karmas which add on to the sanchitam karma and becomes the seed for future births.  
  
4 - Can death be avoided and if so how to avoid death?  
Luckily there is a way to escape death and the birth that follows.  
Krishna says ``on reaching Me there is no rebirth.''  
मामुपेत्य तु कौन्तेय पुनर्जन्म न विद्यते BG(8.16) The question,  
now is: '' where is He? and how to reach Him?'' The answer to  
these questions form the main topic of discussions in our scriptures  
like Gita, Upanishads and puranas like Shri Bhagavatam and is  
beyond the scope of this essay and so is not attempted. One has to  
learn it from a qualified teacher.  
  
अभ्रगंगातरंगाभिरामोत्तमांङ्गं   -   
अभ्रं = sky; गंगा = the river Ganges. So the word  
अभ्रगंंगा means the heavenly river Ganges; तरंगः = wave;  
अभिरामः = pleasing, charming; उत्तम = best; The  
word उत्तमांगं indicates the best limb in the body viz. the  
head; This says that Shiva looks charming with the waves of the divine  
river Ganges on His head गंगाधरः - धरतीति धरः ।  
गङ्गायाः धरः इति गङ्गाधरः (SS146) and SA(27). Also  
धूर्जटिः - धूः गङ्गा जटासु यस्य सः धूर्जटिः । नमः  
कपर्दिने इति श्रुतिः (SS286)जटार्द्रः - जटसु  
कपर्दनामिकासु गङ्गाप्रयुक्तमार्द्रं यस्य सः (SS797).  
  
The river Ganges was, according to our scriptures, originally flowing  
in the heavens. The story of Lord Vishnu's incarnation  
and His seeking three feet of land from the king Bali is familiar to  
all. When He lifted up His foot to measure the heavens,  
Brahma the creator, seized the rare opportunity and washed the holy  
foot of the Lord that has come his way with water from  
his water pot. The waters became the holy river Ganga.   
धातुः कमंडलुजलं तदुरुक्रमस्य पादावनेजन-पवित्रतया नरेन्द्र ।  
स्वर्धुन्यभून्नभसि सा पतती निमार्ष्टि लोकत्रयं भगवतो  
विशदेव कीर्तिः । BH(8.21.4)  
The story of the descent of Ganga to earth is also familiar. It is  
mentioned briefly in Bhagavata in skanda 4 - chapter 17 and  
skanda 9 - chapter 9. It is given in detail in the Balakanda of  
Ramayana. Sage Viswamitra narrated it to Rama and LakShmana as  
he was taking them to Mithila after he had successfully completed his  
sacrifice with protection offered by the brothers. King Bhagirata - a  
scion of the ikShvAku dynasty to which Rama belonged - was  
instrumental in bringing the river to earth by performing severe penance. At his request Shiva received the mighty flow  
of Ganga falling from the heavens and released it as a  
stream on the earth. A large gathering comprising the residents of  
the higher worlds and great seers came to witness the wonderful event. They, along with the people of this world, praised the  
waters of the river Ganga as pure because of its contact  
with Lord Shiva भवाङ्ग पतितं तोयं पवित्रमिति  
पस्पृशुः (1.43.28).  
Hence the saying काश्यां तु मरणान्मुक्तिः (ie.) death in  
Kasi, now known as Varanasi, brings about salvation.  
King ParikShit decided to spend the last seven days of his life at  
the banks of the river because of this reason कस्तां न सेवेत  
मरिष्यमाणः । BH(1.19.6) It asks ``which dying man will not  
resort to such a holy river?''  
  
Ganga:-  
Now let us get behind the story of Ganga and see what it means.  
Brahma to whom Bhagirata prays blesses his efforts. But He cautions  
the king that he should pray to Lord Shiva and involve  Him in this  
matter because the earth cannot withstand the fall  
of Ganga from the heavens. He adds that no one other than Lord Shiva  
is capable of receiving the torrent from the heaven. This  
is because Brahma knows that Shiva is firm and unshakeable.  
स्थाणुः । स्थिरत्वात् (VS 28). Also SA(72) स्थाणुः वृक्षः  
तत्साम्यात् स्थाणुः । वृक्ष इव स्तब्धो दिवि  
तिष्ठत्येकस्तेनेदं पूर्णं - पुरुषेण सर्वम्   
  
The ग in the name Ganga stands for Gayatri which represents the  
eternal, supreme Brahman. In Gangashtakam, she is addressed as the  
very embodiment of Brahman, पूर्णब्रह्मस्वरूपे . She is eternal  
and formed by the fusion of the powers extracted from the three -  
Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. So Gayatri is worshipped in their forms  
during the three times it is recited  
(viz.) morning, noon and the evening. In view of this Shiva has placed  
her on the head - in the chakra called Brahmarandram.  
The scriptures define six chakras or seats of power in one's body.  
The chakra on the head is above all these and is  
the seat of Brahman. This is also the seat where one visualises one's  
guru in the form of Brahman and meditates on him  
because one's guru is not different from Brahman  
गुरुस्साक्षात्परम्ब्रह्म . The fact that she is formed from the  
powers of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva is stated symbolically in the story  
of Ganga.    
आदावादिपितामहस्य नियमव्यापारपात्रे जलं,  
पश्चात् पत्रगशायिनो भगवतः पादोदकं पावनम् ।  
भूयः शंभु जटा विभूषणमणिर्जह्नोर्महर्षेरियं,  
कन्या कल्मषनाशिनी भगवती भागीरथी भूतले।   
This says that ``you Ganga started as water in the water pot of  
Brahma, then came into contact with the foot of Vishnu and  
again became the crown jewel on the locks of Shiva etc.''  
  
Placed on the head of Shiva who is Himself the embodiment of knowledge  
the stream of Ganga is symbolic of knowledge. So Shankaracharya refers  
to it in his Kasi Panchakam as ज्ञानप्रवाहो विमलादि गङ्गा  
The stream of right knowledge is the pure original Ganga. Again later  
he says त्रिभुवनजननी व्यापिनी ज्ञानगङ्गा(ie.) the  
Ganga of knowledge is the mother of the three worlds.  
This Ganga who is Gayatri and Brahman and is kept in the chakra in  
the head by Shiva is same as Uma or Parvati  can be  
deduced from the following references. These are taken from the well  
known Lalitasahasranamam (LS).  
1 - She is of the form of the three gods, Brahma, Vishnu and Rudra.  
सृष्टिकर्त्री ब्रह्मरूपा LS(265) गोप्त्री  
गोविन्दरूपिणी LS(267) संहारिणी रुद्ररूपा LS(269)  
2 - She is Gayatri गायत्री LS(420)  
3 - She is Bhavani भवानी LS(112). Durga दुर्गा  
LS(190). Parvati पार्वती LS(246). Uma उमा LS(633)  
4 - She is seated on the head in the Brahmarandhram.  
शिरस्थिता LS(591)  
  
So Ganga is Brahman, is Gayatri and is Uma or Parvati. She  
proclaims the Ardhanari (the inseparable combination of the  
male and female principles) concept (अर्धनारी स्वरूपम् ) of  
Shiva which is not explicitly seen in His representations (where Uma  
is shown as a separate figure). Thus one who knows Ganga  knows Shiva  
and vice versa.  
Krishna says स्रोतसामस्मि जाह्नवी Of the rivers I am the  
Ganges. So  it is not an ordinary river that the Lord had placed  
on His head. No wonder, then, that the very utterance of the name  
Ganga washes away one's sins even when one is miles  
away from the river. This is said in this popular verse that is  
normally recited before taking bath.  
 गङ्गे गङ्गेति यो ब्रूयात् योजनानां शतैरपि। मुच्यते  
सर्वपापेभ्यो विष्णुलोकं स गच्छति।   
The avadhuta saint Sadasiva Brahmam has composed a song in praise of  
Ganga (jaya tungatarange gange जय तुङ्गतरङ्गे गङ्गे )  
wherein he salutes Ganga as one who purifies the worlds and cuts  
asunder the manifold bonds of mankind  
(कमलभवाण्डकमण्डपवित्रे, बहुविधबन्धच्छेदलवित्रे।  
लवित्रं = sickle; instrument for mowing).  
Shri Gangashtakam says that if one dies on the banks of Ganga he goes  
to higher lokas compared to which even the world of  
Indra looks very inferior .  
त्वदुत्सङ्गे गङ्गे पतति यदि कायस्तनुभृतां  
तदा मातः शातक्रतव-पदल्लाभोऽप्यतिलघुः   
  
We can make one observation on the story of Bhagirata bringing  
down Ganga. The Lord - being the father - always gives  
much more than what one seeks from Him though this fact is not  
appreciated. He is कामप्रदः । भक्तेभ्यः कामान् प्रकर्षेण  
ददातीति कामप्रदः VS(298). He knows what the devotee asks and  
why he asks for it. The Lord not only gives what is asked for but  
goes further and fulfills his mission though unasked. In the case of  
Bhagiratha, he could have asked Shiva  
for salvation for himself and his forefathers and got it. Instead, he  
just asked Him to bear the Ganga as she came down from  
the heaven. But Lord Shiva helped the king  not only in bringing down  
the river but also gave salvation to his forefathers then  
and there itself. Please carefully look at what Shiva told the king  
when He appeared before him. He said  ``I am pleased with  
you. I will do what is dear to you.'' Ramayana (1.43.3 and 4)  
    उमापतिः पशुपतिः राजानमिदमब्रवीत्। प्रीतस्तेऽहं  
नरश्रेष्ठ करिष्यामि तव प्रियम्।   
  
We all know what was dear to the king and what was it that had been  
haunting his mind for years and made him do severe  
penance, once to Brahma (for thousand years eating once a month and  
so on) and again to Lord Shiva. The king's idea was to  
then lead the river to the place  where the ashes of his forefathers  
were lying for ages and perform their final rites so that they  
will attain release. But this was what he got as bonus. In addition  
he got salvation for himself also though he did not ask for it.  
Ganga represents Brahman and Shiva is DakShinamurthi - the giver of  
knowledge about the Brahman. Thus the story of the  
king getting the Ganga with Shiva's help implies he got the knowledge  
of Brahman directly from the Lord which knowledge  
results in salvation.  
  
This was what happened in  the case of Arjuna also. He met Krisna at  
Dwaraka and asked His help during the KurukShetra  
war. Krishna agreed to help but He said He will not take up arms. But  
even at the time when Arjuna made his request  
Krishna knew what was the mission for which he was seeking His help.  
And He fulfilled it then and there. Later on when  
teaching Gita before the war had even started He told Arjuna:    
``These enemies of yours had been killed by me already. You  
just be the instrument and enjoy all the glory.''  
तस्मात्वमुत्तिष्ठ यशो लभस्व जित्वा शत्रून् भुङ्क्ष्व राज्यं समृद्धम् ।  
ममैवैते निहिताः पूर्वमेव निमित्तमात्र्ं भव सव्यसाचिन्। BG(11.33)  
At the time, Arjuna was unaware of the greatness of Krishna whom, as  
he admits later on, he considered as his friend only.  He laboured  
hard and ``fought the war'' but it was over even before it  
started. He ``won'' it and got all the glory.  
In the same way King Bhagirata took the trouble to drive ahead of  
Ganga all the way to the seas and then to the nether world  
where he saw the ashes of his forefathers, performed the last rites  
with the holy waters from Ganga and ``got them salvation.''  
which was already an accomplished fact.  
The Ganga was named after him as Bhagirathi. This  
was the case with Dhruva, who wanted to be a king but he got that and  
also a permanent place in the heavens.  
  
ओंकारवाटीकुरङ्गं -   
ओंकार = the holy syllable OM; वाटी = garden, park;   
कुरंगः = deer; Shiva is likened to a deer in the garden of the  
holy syllable - meaning He is represented by OM also known as pranava.  
ओंकाररूपः - ओंकारः रूपं स्वरूपं यस्य सः  
तथा(SS138)  Shri Krishna says in His Gita (10-25) ``I am OM  
among the words.'' गिरामस्म्येकमक्षरम् Manu, the famous  
law giver, says that the letter OM by itself represents the ultimate  
reality - the Brahman एकाक्षरं परं ब्रह्म He adds that  
the creator Brahma extracted the three letters from the three vedas  
and so the syllable Om is the essence of the vedas  
अकारं चाप्युकारं च मकारं च प्रजापतिः ।  
वेदत्रयान्निरदुहद् भूर्भुवः स्वरितीति च   
A similar reference is seen in Chandogyopanishad (2.23.3)   
तान्यभ्यतपत्तेभ्योऽभितप्तेभ्य ॐकारः संप्रास्रवत्त्द्यथा  
Shri Bhagavatam says that sound OM was acquired spontaneously by  
Brahma - the first born when he was in deep meditation. BH(12.6.44 and 39) . It says that the origin of the sound  
consisting of three parts is unmanifest. It flashes by itself and it  
reveals the nature of the  almighty and supreme spirit.   
समाहितात्मनो ब्रह्मन् ब्रह्मणः परमेष्ठिनः  ।  
हृद्याकाशादभून्नादो वृत्तिरोधाद् विभाव्यते। ।  
ततोऽभूत् त्रिवृदोंकारो योऽव्यक्तप्रभवः स्वराट्  ।  
यत् तल्लिङ्गं भगवतो ब्रह्मणः परमात्मनः ।   
  
Manu says further that a student (during his gurukula days when he  
learns the vedas) should utter OM both when beginning  
and ending his studies. The reason, he says, is that without uttering  
OM in the beginning the learning perishes and if OM is not  
said in the end what is learnt will not be retained   
ब्राह्मणः प्रणवं कुर्यादादावन्ते च सर्वदा।  
स्रवत्यनोङ्कृतं पूर्वं पुरस्ताच्च विशीर्यति।   
In view of this Kalidasa compares Manu -the first of kings in the  
solar dynasty to OM in a grand simile आसीन्महीक्षितामाद्यः  
प्रणवश्चन्दसामिव   
  
Pranava :-  
We can see discussions about pranava in Mandukya, Shiva Atharvasikha,  
Prasna and Nrisimha Uttaratapini upanishads. This is  
also mentioned in Vicharasagaram. Here we will see it in brief.  
प्रणवः - प्रणवो नाम परमात्मनो वाचक ओङ्कारः ,  
तदभेदोपचारेणायं प्रणवः (VS-957).  
He is in the form of pranava represented by OM. He is not different  
from the creation. So pranava represents both brahman  
and the universe. Sage Patanjali also has said this in his Yoga Sutra  
(1.26)तस्य वाचकः प्रणवः । प्रकर्षेण नूयते अनेनेति  
प्रणवः God is greatly praised by this. Earlier we saw that a  
stotram mentions the attributes or the qualities of the subject of  
the stotram. Thus pranavam indicates the auspicious qualities of the  
Lord and obtains His blessings to one who  
chants it.  Patanjali adds (1.27): तज्जपस्तदर्थभावनम्॥  
  
The chanting of pranava with understanding and faith is meditation  
on the Iswara.  
Pranava is made of the three letters A,U and M. These three letters  
represent the consciousness presiding over the three states -  
waking, dream and deep sleep states which one passes through every  
day. The consciousnes is same but it functions diff erently in these states. The Mandukya upanishad views pranava as  
being composed of two parts: one having sound and the  
other without sound. The OM as specified above made up of the three  
letters is pronounced and constitutes the ``sound'' part.  
The upanishad says that the brief interlude that preceeds and  
succeeds this ``sound'' part forms the ``silent'' component - the fourth letter  
अमात्रश्चतुर्थो ऽव्यवहार्यः प्रपञ्चोपशमः शिवो ऽद्वैत  
एवमोंकार आत्मैव संविशत्यात्मानं, य एवं वेद, य  
एवं वेद(Mandukya 12)  
They represent the two aspects of God (viz.) with form and without  
form respectively. The ``sound'' part signifies the saguna  
Iswara and the ``silent'' part the nirguna Iswara. Thus one  
can worship  OM as God with form. This is like invoking our favou rite deity in an idol or saligrama stone. Here we invoke the God  
about whom we do not have firsthand knowledge but learnt  
from scriptures or  from some other source in the idol or some other  
form of representation and worship. The representa tion is known as pratikam प्रतीकम्. Meditating on the fourth or  
the silent part as ``I the Self'' is known as  
Ahamgrahadhyanam अहंग्रहध्यानम् One who meditates like  
this is called a muni मननात् मुनिरुच्यते In this type of  
meditation there is no difference between the meditator and Iswara or  
the object of meditation. As a result of this meditation the muni is  
blessed with the knowledge of the Self and crosses over the samsara.  
Thus is explained Shiva's name ओङ्काररूपः । ओङ्कारं रूपं  
स्वरूपं यस्य सः तथा। ओङ्काररूपत्वं च  
तदभिधानत्वाद्वा, तत्प्रतीकत्वाद्वा। तदभिधानत्वं  
ओमित्यक्षरमित्यादिना प्रसिद्धम्। ओङ्कार प्रतीकत्वं तु यः  
पुनरेतं त्रिमात्रेणेत्यादिना प्रश्नोपनिषदादौ प्रसिद्धम्।  
परं चापरं च ब्रह्म यदोङ्कार इति श्रुतिः VS(138).    
  
The question, now is, if He is Himself omkara or the pranava, why  
then say He is the deer in the park called OM? The answer  
is that He is OM the park as Paramatma as well as the deer the  
individual JIvatma. They are one and the same but look diff erent to the uninitiated. The deer, unaware of its status, roams  
around in the park feeding  and enjoying itself. This is an echo  
of the famous Mundakopanishad mantra  
द्वा सुपर्णा सयुजा सखाया समानं वृक्षं  
परिषस्वजाते। तयोरन्यः पिप्पलं स्वाद्वत्त्यनश्ननन्यो  
अभिचाकशीति। MU (3.1.1)  
This mantra talks of two friendly birds sitting side by side on a  
tree. One is eating and relishing the fruits and the other one is  
quietly watching it. Here one of the birds represents the Jivatma.  
Eating the fruits is enjoying the results of the past karma and  
the other bird which looks on is the Paramatma as He is not attached  
to the fruits of action. Similarly Devi is described as  
ओंकारपञ्जरशुकी a female parrot in the cage called OM in  
the Devi Navaratnamala. The saint composer Thiagaraja of Tiruvaiyaru  
addresses Rama as ओंकारपञ्जरकीर a parrot in the cage  
called OM in his famous song beginning Jagadanandakaraka. Similarly  
the saint composer SadasivaBrahmam talks of Krishna as  
प्रणवपयोरुहगर्भकपाली one who is hidden inside the lotus of pranava (in his song kridathi  
vanamali क्रीडति वनमाली )   
  
सिद्धसंसेविताङ्घ्रिं   -   
सिद्धः = a superhuman being of great purity and holiness  
possessing eight supernatural powers called siddhis. Can also be  
taken to mean a great sage संसेवित = worshipped; अंघ्रि = foot  
He is worshipped by great sages and other semidivine beings  
endowed with supernatural powers महर्षिवन्दितः - महर्षिभिः  
वामदेवादिभिः हरभक्तादिभिश्च ज्ञानार्तं वन्दितः ।  
उपलक्षणमेतत् स्तोत्र-जप-पूजा-तप आदीनाम्(SS536) सद्भिः  
सम्पूजितः । सद्भिः सात्विकैर्देवर्ष्यादिभिः सम्पूजितः ।  
भक्तिश्रद्धादिना गन्धपुष्पादिभिः  
प्रदक्षिणनमस्कारादिभिश्च पूजितः सम्पूजितः SS(777)  
The word siddha सिद्ध means accomplished or perfected. Linking  
with the earlier word, the muni meditates on the pranava.  
ॐकारं बिन्दुसंयुक्तं नित्यं ध्यायन्ति योगिनः Once he  
understands that he, the meditator, and the Iswara the  
object of meditation represented by pranava are not different , then  
he achieves his goal and becomes a siddha purusha.  The Mandukya  
Upanishad sentence quoted earlier says this only (viz.) that one who  
realises the true meaning of  the Omkara - that  
it stands for the non-dual, indescribable Shiva obtains his goal which  
is his own Self. Shri Shuka mentions this in his prayer before  
he begins to narrate Bhagavatam to King ParikShit.  
यदङ्घ्र्यभिध्यानसमाधिधौतया धियानुपश्यन्ति हि  
तत्त्वमात्मनः BH(2.4.21)   
  
Such a realised sage  abides in his Self.  So it is said   
तद्विष्णोः परमं पदं सदा पश्यन्ति सूरयः Hanuman is  
such a siddha who has immersed himself in the sacred Ganga and drank  
deep its water of knowledge. So he is known as बुद्धिमतां  
वरिष्ठः = best among the knowledgeable people. He sees his Lord  
Rama within himself all the time. Whenever His name is mentioned the  
Ganga within him wells up and flows out as tears of joy and his hands  
go up over his  
head in salute यत्र यत्र रघुनात कीर्तनं तत्र तत्र  
कृतमस्तकाञ्जलिं बाष्पवारिपरिपूरितेक्षणं मारुतिं नमत  
राक्षसान्तकम् says a popular verse about Hanuman. So his being  
shown as seated at the feet of Rama brings  
out the idea that siddhas worship the feet of the Lord.  
Truly speaking a siddha has nothing to worship as he has no second to  
him. Whatever he does becomes an act of worship.  
Sankaracharya says this in his Shiva mAnasa puja   
आत्मा त्वं गिरिजा मतिः सहचराः प्राणाः शरीरं गृहं  
पूजा ते विषयोपभोगरचना निद्रा समाधिस्थ्तितिः  ।  
सञ्चारः पदयोः प्रदक्षिणविधिः स्तोत्राणि सर्वा गिरः  
यद्यत्कर्म करोमि तत्तदकिलं शंभो तवाराधनम्।   
  
Since the siddha has identified with Ishwara he is detached from his  
body. He knows that he got his body because of prarabdham and it will continue to hang on as appendage as long as the the  
vestige of prarabdham remains. He is aware that prarab dam will take care of it. So he is not concerned about it just as  
drunkard does not  overly bother about his dress. Krishna says  
this to Uddhava:   
देहं च नश्वरमवस्थितमुत्थितं वा सिद्धो न पश्यति  
यतोऽध्यगमत्स्वरूपम् ।  
दैवादपेतमुत दैववशादुपेतं वासो यथा परिकृतं  
मदिरामदान्धः । BH(11.13.36)   
  
Once his prarabdham is exhausted the body drops off. There is not  
death in the usual sense. His soul does not go anywhere as  
in the case of death of ordinary people but just merges in the all  
pervading brahman. This is like a pot getting broken. The  
space within the pot is not disturbed but just becomes one with  
surrounding space. This is said clearly in Brihadaranyakopanishad (4.4.3)   
योऽकामो निष्काम आप्तकाम आत्मकामो न तस्य  
प्राणा उत्क्रामन्ति ब्रहैव सन् ब्रह्माप्येति  
This was what is said to have happened in Bhishma's case .  
आत्मन्यात्मानमावेस्य सोऽन्तश्वास उपारमत् BH(1.9.43)   
  
भजे = I worship मार्गबन्धुम् the Lord Margabandhu.    
  
I worship Lord Margabandhuon whose limbs snakes appear prominently,  
whose head looks charming with the waves of the  
celestial river Ganga, who is like a deer in the garden of Omkara and  
whose feet are served by siddhas (great seers).  
  
      ३. नित्यम् चिदानन्दरूपं   
      निह्नुताशेषलोकेशवैरिप्रतापं   
      कार्तस्वरागेन्द्रचापं कृत्तिवासं   
      भजे दिव्यसन्मार्गबन्धुम्। शंभो   
This verse is the third among the five verses that make up the  
stotram. Thus it forms the centre-piece and is loaded with precious  
vedantic truths. It was said earlier that a stotram  will describe the  
Lord with form and will also refer to His formless aspect. We see the  
formless aspect of the Shiva being emphasised here  
नित्यं चिदानन्दरूपं  - नित्यं = eternal, ever lasting,  
imperishable चित् = pure intelligence आनन्द =supreme  
bliss रूपं = form.  
  
These words are the repetition of the famous  
upanishadic mantra सत्यं ज्ञानमनन्तं ब्रह्म   
TU(2.1.2) that says  
Brahman is satyam, jnanam and anantam.   This is one of Shiva's  
names सच्चिदानन्दरूपः । सत्पदेन कालत्रयाबाध्यं  
स्वरूपमुच्यते। चित्पदेन   
प्रकाशान्तरनिरपेक्षतया प्रकाशमानम्। आनन्दपदेन   
निरतिशयप्रेमास्पदतया सुखरूपं एतत्त्रितियात्मकरूपं यस्य सः  
सच्चिदानन्दरूपः । SS(653). Rama's form is existence,  
knowledge and bliss सत्यज्ञानानन्दशरीरी says the saint  
Sadasiva Brahmendra  in the song खेलति मम हृदये (kelati mama  
hrudaye). So is Shri Lalita's form:  सच्चिदानन्दरूपिणी। सत्वं  
चित्वमानन्दश्च  स्वरूपमत एव   
विद्यान्तरेषूपसंहार्यमस्या इति सच्चिदानन्दरूपिणी। LS(699)  
  
नित्यं  - Nityam implies eternal existence - that is - it never ceases  
to be. It is not limited by time. Terms like the past, present and future  
are not applicable with reference to it. Lalita is known as Nitya  
नित्या कालत्रयेऽप्यबाध्या। अविनाशी वा  अरेऽयमात्मे ति  
श्रुतेः । LS(136).  
  
शाश्वतः and सत्यम् are two other names that have the same  
meaning as Nityam  
शाश्वतः । सर्वेषु कालेषु एकरूपतया भवतीति  
शाश्वतः । ᳚शाश्वतोयं   
पुराणः᳚ इति श्रुतिः । SS(398).(ie.) He exists in all times in the same form or  
without any change शश्वत् सर्वेषु कालेषु भवतीति शाश्वतः,  
᳚शाश्वतं शिवमच्युतम्᳚ इति   
श्रुतेः । VS(56).  
  
satyam सत्यम्।  कालत्रयाबाद्यं  
सत्यम् SS(432)अवितथरूपत्वात् परमात्मा सत्यः ᳚सत्यं   
ज्ञानमनन्तं ब्रह्म᳚ इति   
श्रुतेः । VS(106) In the invocatory  
verse to Shri Bhagavatam Shri Vyasa salutes the Lord saying सत्यं परं  
धीमहि(ie.) we meditate on the supreme Reality that is not affected  
by the three time periods - the past, present and the future. BH(1.1.1)  
. He also winds up with the same words सत्यं परं धीमहि  
BH(12.13.19) implying what is discussed in between the beginning and  
the end or the subject matter of the purana is none other than Brahman  
which is Satyam.  
  
Shri Lalita is known as सत्यज्ञानानन्दरूपा॥ सत्यं ज्ञानं  
आनन्दश्च रूपं यस्याः ।  ᳚सत्यं   ज्ञानमनन्तं ब्रह्म᳚  
᳚विज्ञानमानन्दं ब्रह्मेति᳚ श्रुतेः । LS(790).  
  
Bhartrihari, in the invocatory verse to his Satakatrayam  salutes the  
Lord saying दिक्कालाद्यनवच्छिन्ना   
अनन्तचिन्मात्रमूर्तये  
He says that God is of the form of eternal consciousness unlimited by  
spatial direction, time etc दिशः   
प्राच्यादिदिक्प्रदेशाः,  
काला  भूतभविष्यद्वर्तमानरूपा,   
आदिशब्दसंगृहीतानि  
वस्तूनि तथा च दिक्काला आदयो येषां तानि दिक्कालानि।   
तैरनवच्छिन्नापरिकॣप्ता। विभुत्वान्नित्यत्वादेकत्वाच्च  
देशतः कालतो  
वस्तुतश्चापरिच्छिन्नेत्यर्थः । अत  
एव अनन्तापरिमिता। ट्रिविधपरिच्छेदशून्यत्वा  
दखण्डदण्डायमाने-  त्यर्थः ।  
चित्  - chit means pure intelligence and indicates brahman. So  
the Lord gets the following names चिदात्मा। चित् -  
चैतन्यं आत्मस्वरूपं यस्य सः चिदात्मा SS(456). Also  
चिन्मयः । चिन्मयश्चिद्रूपः ।  
SS(829). Devi is described as  
चिन्मयी ।  
चिदभेदाच्चिन्मयी LS(251).  
Now let us go back to the reference from Bartruhari:    
(ie.) अनन्तचिन्मात्रमूर्तये ।  
चिन्मात्रा  ज्ञानघना  
च ।  
चिदेकरसेति यावत्। तादृशी मूर्तिर्यस्य तस्मै ।  
एतद्रूपायेत्यर्थः । No doubt brahman is without any limitations  
mentioned above. But it is not void or empty like space which also seems  
unlimited. It is not inert but shines in the form of consciousness. This  
is clarified here.  
  
From where did He get His wisdom? In reply the invocatory verse in  
Shri Bhagavatam referred to earlier says: अभिज्ञः स्वराट्। स्वेनैव  
राजते यस्तम्। स्वतः सिद्धज्ञानमित्यर्थः । He is omniscient. His  
knowledge is inherent and not obtained from anyone else or any other  
source. It is knowledge itself without a trace of ignorance.  
  
आनन्द   Ananda : Brahamn is of the form of pure bliss आनन्दो  
ब्रह्मेति व्यजानात् TU(3.6.1). The Taittiriyopanishad has a chapter  
exclusively devoted to the ananda aspect of brahman. This chapter is hence  
known as Brahmanandavalli or Anandavalli. This chapter is unique in that  
it talks of several grades of ananda experienced by different beings. It  
starts with the maximum happiness that is possible to be experienced by  
a human being as the unit of measure. The next higher grade of ananda  
is hundred times this unit. Thus several grades are mentioned (including  
that of Indra and Brihaspathi) and the top most one mentioned is that of  
Brahma the creator. But a wise person who has studied the shastras and  
got discrimination knows that even Brahma's happiness is fragile and  
limited. The Brihadaranyopanishad says that any ananda experienced by  
any being is just a droplet derived from the bliss that is Brahman  
एतस्यैवानन्दस्य अन्यानि भूतानि मात्रामुपजीवन्ति(4.3.32)  
Incidentally this is one of the names of Shri Lalita. (LS365)  
स्वात्मानन्दलवीभूत ब्रह्माद्यानन्दसंततिः । The commentator  
Bhaskararaya explains this name referring to these quotations  
only. He says स्वस्या आत्मरूपो य   
आनन्दस्य लवीभूता इन्द्राद्यानन्दबिन्दुपर्यालोचनया सागरायमाणत्वेनालवा  
अपि  देव्यानन्दसागरस्य लवाः संपद्यमानाः ब्रह्मादीनां

One may wonder why should the upanishad take the trouble  
to describe the  
many grades of ananda starting from the bliss that can be enjoyed by a  
human being. The answer is that the detailed description is a carrot the  
upanishad is dangling before us. It wants to reveal the fact that even  
the highest degree of happiness that one could enjoy is just a particle  
of that limitless ocean of bliss. It wants us to get excited at this  
revelation. It wants to prod us to strive hard and reach the pinnacle  
of bliss that is brahmananda and not be content with merely scratching  
its surface.  The following are the Lord's names in this context   
  
नन्दी। परमानन्दविग्रहो नन्दी। ᳚विज्ञानमानन्दं ब्रह्मे᳚ति  
श्रुतिः । SS(189) and VS(618)आनन्दी। सुखस्वरूपत्वात्  
आनन्दी VS(560) . Also ब्रह्मानन्दः । ब्रह्मरूप  
आनन्दो ब्रह्मानन्दः । ᳚आनन्दं  ब्रह्म मां  
ज्ञात्वा न बिभेति कुतश्चने᳚ ति  
पाद्मे।᳚ आनन्दं

कालत्रयाऽबाधितनिरतिशयसुखस्वरूपः सदानन्दः । ᳚  
विज्ञानमानन्दं ब्रह्मे᳚ ति श्रुतिः ।  
SS(673)  
  
निह्नुताशेषलोकेशवैरिप्रतापम्  - निह्नुत = eliminated  
अशेष = without remainder लोकेशः = lord of the universe -  
here it refers to Indra वैरिन् = enemy प्रतापः =dignity,  
glory, valour.  
  
Shiva is the destroyer of the valour and pride of Ravana who was the enemy  
of Indra. Once Ravana tried to lift Kailasa as he felt he was strong  
enough to carry even the abode of  the Lord. He was inebriated with power  
because he could conquer even Indra and other gods. He forgot that all  
his might and glory were only due to the blessings of the Lord. He even  
said that Shiva has not known that a danger has come to Him! This incident  
is mentioned in Ramayana (Uttara Kanda - canto 16).  विज्ञातव्यं न  
जानीते भयस्थानमुपस्थितम्(Uttara kanda - 16-24). Shiva wanted  
to teach him a lesson and curb his pride. So He playfully pressed His  
toe. The pressure applied by Him crushed Ravana under the mountain.  
ततो राम महादेवो देवानां प्रवरो हरः ।  
पादाङ्गुष्ठेन  
तं शैलं  पीडयामास लीलया। ।  
पीडितास्तु ततस्तस्य  
शैलस्तम्भोपमा भुजाः । (UK. 16-27,28).  
Ravana struggled hard but was not able to extricate himself  
from the tight spot. Finally he prayed to the Lord and got  
himself released. So Shiva gets the name अङ्गुष्ठशिरसा   
लङ्कानाथदर्पहरः । अङ्गुष्ठशिरसा पादाङ्गुष्ठाग्रेण  
लङ्कानाथस्य रावणस्य दर्पं गर्वं हरतीति हरः । इदं  
च रामायणादौ प्रसिद्धम् ।  शिवरहस्ये  - अमुष्य  
त्वत्सेवासमधिगतसारं भुजवनं  
बलात्कैलासेऽपि त्वदधिवसतौ विक्रमयतः ।  
अलभ्यापातालेऽप्यलसचलिताङ्गुष्ठशिरसि  
प्रतिष्ठा त्वय्यासीद्ध्रुवमुपचितो मुह्यति खल इति। ।  
᳚नमः सहमानाय निव्याधिन᳚ इति श्रुतिः । SS(623).  
  
Ravana was the grandson of the great sage Pulastya and the son  
of an equally great sage Vivasva. He was born as an asura due to a  
curse. Krishna gives a description of asuric nature in the 16th chapter  
of Gita entitled दैवासुर सम्पद्विभागयोगः and also in the 18th  
chapter. He says that people with asuric nature are given to ostentation,  
arrogance, lust, anger and insolence. They will nurture innumerable  
hopes. These tendencies will pave the way for their downfall.  We see that  
Ravana's character fits this description exatly. These qualities lead  
to his ruin. Ravana was vastly learned (as is indicated by ten heads):    
but was foolish enough to think he could shake the Lord who is नित्यः   
all pervading, firm and unshakeable सर्वगतः स्थाणुः अचलः ।   
BG(2-24).  In fact if He shakes the universe will shake and without  
His will one can not move even a blade of grass. This is graphically  
described in a story in Kenopanishad.  Thus Ravana committed a great  
mistake but Shiva curbed his pride and let him off  
कार्तस्वरागेन्द्रचापम्  - कार्तस्वरम् = gold: अगः = mountain:    
इन्द्रः = lord and in this context means best: चापः = bow:    
This refers to Shiva using Meru - the famed mountain of gold -  
as a bow in His fight against the three asuras. The three demons named  
KamalakShan, DarukakShan and Vidyunmali were very powerful because of  
the boons they obtained. They lived in three cities built by Maya the  
divine architect. They troubled the devas to no end. The devas entreated  
Shiva to save them from these asuras. When Shiva started to fight them the  
devas wanted to take part in the fight. The earth became the chariot,  
the sun and the moon became the wheels, Meru the bow, the snake Seshan  
the bow string, Vishnu the quiver and so on. But Shiva felt that all these  
elaborate paraphernalia was superfluous for the task. So He discarded  
them and destroyed the three cities just with a smile. When the asuras  
repented Shiva forgave them and took them into His service. This deed of  
Shiva is often referred to in hymns क्षोणी यस्य रथो रथाङ्गयुगळं  
चन्द्रार्क-बिम्बद्वयं  
कोदंडः कनकाचलो हरिरभूत् बाणो  
विधिः सारथिः ।

भुजङ्गाधिपः  
तस्मिन् मे हृदयं सुखेन रमतां शांभे

So He gets the following names पुरन्दरः । सुरशत्रूणां पुराणां  
दारणात्पुरन्दरः । त्रिपुरहा॥ ᳚स तिस्रः पुरो  
भित्वे᳚ ति  
श्रुतिः । SS(45) and  VS(335). One who shattered the cities of the

SS(104). and   
पुरञ्जयः - पुरं त्रिपुरं जयतीति  
पुरञ्जयः । ᳚तेषामसुराणामि᳚ति श्रुतिः । SS(939). One who  
conquered the three cities and   
गिरिधन्वा - गिरिः मेरुः धनुर्यस्येति वा धन्व यस्येति वा  
गिरिधन्वा। इदं च  
अर्थतः श्रुतिप्रसिद्धं नाम;᳚  
रुद्राय स्थिरधन्वने गिरः᳚ इति च्छन्दोगानां,  देवव्रते  
च  ᳚ नमः स्थिराय  
स्थिरधन्वने᳚  इति। One whose bow  
is mount Meru. SA(65).  Incidentally, this episode shows that the Lord  
is capable of using anything as a weapon. As Rama He used just a piece  
of straw to chase Kakasura who misbehaved with Sita. In the case of  
Tipura He chose to use a mountain as His bow. He can do without any  
weapon also. He discarded the bow and burnt down the three cities with a  
smile. He subdued Ravana with a little pressure from His toe.He destroyed  
Manmatha with a mere look.  
  
The Tripura episode conceals the essence of vedanta as do the stories  
in our puranas. Krishna mentions this fact to Uddhava in His final  
advice परोक्षवादा ऋषयः '' The words of the sages are indirect  
in their import.'' BH(11-21-35).  The reason is that these great truths  
are meant only for those who have faith in the words of the shastras  
and the teachers who expound them, are sincere and are ready to put in  
the needed effort to learn them. They cannot be laid bare to those who  
are not qualified to receive them. In fact such people run the risk  
of misunderstanding the teachings and being mislead by them . That  
is why Krishna, after concluding the teaching of Gita, warns Arjuna  
that the valuable lessons taught to him should not be imparted to  
one who is not devoted etc., as said above इदं ते नातपस्काय  
नाभक्ताय कदाचन। न चाशुष्रूषवे वाच्यं न च  
मां  
योऽभ्यसूयति। BG(18-67).  Great truths, like precious diamonds are  
not meant to be hawked in the streets like cheap vegetables.  A diamond  
merchant keeps the diamonds carefully locked in an iron safe in his  
shop. Only a handful of people out of several millIons in the city  
will be fit to enter the shop and enquire about them. The merchant,  
will welcome the customer, engage him in small talk  and enquire about  
his requirements. By then he would have assessed the customer's worth  
and seriousness to do business. Then only will he unlock the safe,  
bring out his wares and show them to the customer. Similarly vedantic  
truths are invaluable and are to be guarded carefully and given only to  
the deserving.  Brief explanation of the Tripura episode follows.  
  
It was said that our body is viewed as being made of three layers -  
the gross body, the subtle body and the causal body. These three  
bodies are the three puras or  cities. The  paramatma who is of the  
form of chaitanyam or consciousness is omnipresent and is present in  
the body also, and enlivens it. The body itself, being mere bundle of  
matter, is inert. Krishna says this इदं  
शरीरं कौन्तेय  
क्षेत्रमित्यभिधीयते and in the next verse क्षेत्रज्ञं च मां  
विद्धि सर्व क्षेत्रेषु भारत। BG(13- 1 and 2). The consciousness  
present in the body is known as atma or jiva or jivatma. But it is not a  
part or product of the body that is liable to decay and destruction. Such  
modifications of the body do not affect the jivatma. Even on death  
it is the subtle body which travels to take another body (as stated  
earlier). The atma being all pervading does not travel anywhere. It  
is like a pot being made. We may call the space confined in the pot as  
pot-space (to distinguish it from the total space though really there is  
no such division) but it was not created when the pot was made. When the  
pot is broken, it is pot that is destroyed and not the ``pot space.'' It  
has nowhere to go. The confines of the pot having gone it just merges  
with the total space that is out side the pot also. Thus the atma has  
nothing to do with the body. This is said in Tattvabodha clearly as  
आत्मा कः?What is the Self?  
स्थूल-सूक्ष्म-कारण-  
शरीराद् व्यतिरिक्तः पञ्चकोशातीतः सन् अवस्थात्रयसाक्षी  
सच्चिदानन्दस्वरूपः सन्  
यस्तिष्ठति स आत्मा। Self is other  
than the gross, subtle and causal bodies. It is beyond the five sheaths  
and the witness to the three states of consciousness. It is of the nature  
of existence, consciousness and bliss.  
  
Thus there is no birth or modifications or death for the jivatma as  
is the case with the body. Krishna says this: न जायते म्रियते  
वा कदाचि-न्नायं भूत्वा भविता वा न भूयः ।  
अजो नित्यः  
शाश्वतोऽयं पुराणो न हन्यते हन्यमाने शरीरे। BG(2-20).  
  
The pot because of which the infinite space (that has nothing to do with  
the pot) gets the apparent limitation as ``pot space'' is called upadhi. In  
the same way the body mind complex is upadhi for the paramatma and it gets  
the name jivatma (though both are one and the same). Its glorious state  
gets covered by the veiling power of maya (called avidya or ignorance)  
and it gets bound. This leads the jiva to identify itself with the  
limitations of the three bodies. It imagines it is a finite creature,  
helpless and subject to sorrows like sickness, old age, death etc. This  
is known as samsara. Truly speaking the jivatma being none other than  
the paramatma and of the form of pure wisdom does not act or undergo  
any change. Since it does not act it does not also reap the fruits of  
action called कर्मफलम् (ie.) joy or sorrow. That is, it is not  
a  कर्ता or भोक्ता (i.e.) doer or enjoyer or in other words  
atma is said to be akarta and abhokta (अकर्ता and अभोक्ता ).  
One who has shed his identity with the body and clearly established  
his oneness with the Self  is, therefore, not bound by the results of  
actions . The mistaken identification with the body and imgining he or  
she is an individual who has to act etc., is called ego or ahamkara and  
is the cause of all the problems.        प्रकृतेः कृयमाणानि  
गुणैः कर्माणि सर्वशः ।  
अहङ्कारविमूढात्मा कर्ताहमिति मन्यते। BG(3-27).  
An example will illustrate this peculiar situation. A person goes to  
sleep in his cosy house after a sumptuous meal. After some time he  
enters the dream world. In his dream he travels to  a distant land and  
is stranded. He has lost his belongings and is famished. But he has no  
money to buy anything. The person is not used to  such a privation and  
so is feeling miserable.  This goes on for some (dream) days.Ultimately  
the intensity of the suffering becomes too much to bear and he wakes up  
with a start . To his utter delight he realises all that had happened was  
only a dream and he has not left his comfortable bed. He feels sheepish  
to think of the suffering he had gone through.  
  
In the case narrated above all the suffering and misery was unreal. But  
it appeared real because the person identified himself with the dream  
body that was not his. The dream body was merely a projection of his  
mind and so had no substance. When the dreamer woke up he gave up the  
identification and was free from sorrow. In the same way vedanta says  
that the individual's bondage and ensuing samsara are imaginary and due  
to wrong identification with the body-mind complex. This mistake is the  
result of ajnanam or ignorance. It will go when the individual sheds  
his ignorance and realises that he is not the body-mind complex but  
the atma whose nature is नित्यं चिदानन्दरूपम् as said in the  
first line of this verse. Krishna says this to his friend Uddhava:   
देहस्थोऽपि न देहस्थो विद्वान्स्वप्नाद्यथोत्थितः ।  
अदेहस्थोऽपि  
देहस्थः कुमतिः  स्वप्नदृग्यथा। BH(11-11-8).  A wise man, though  
he appears to be in the body, has no identification with the body like  
the one who had woken up from a dream. But a man without discrimination  
is like one having a dream. He has chosen to (dis-identify with his true  
body and) identify with his (dream) body (and suffers the consequences).  
The dream body is only thought in the mind but the thought is so powerful  
that it makes him identify himself with the dream body, undergo the  
vicarious suffering and forget his real body that is ensconced in the bed.  
  
Thus there has to be a second waking up, as it were, from our so-called  
waking stage to the real awakened stage with the advent of knowledge or  
jnanam. Till then one is in the clutches of agnanam or ignorance which  
forces us into karma or action that  brings in the fruits of action  
which in turn results in rebirth etc.. The grace of the Lord confers this  
wisdom and takes one beyond the three bodies that envelop the jiva. This  
is said in the DakShinamurthy Stotram as   
यः साक्षात्-कुरुते प्रबोधसमये स्वात्मान-मेवाद्वयं  
तस्मै श्रीगुरुमूर्तये नम इदं श्रीदक्षिणामूर्तये  
When the dreamer wakes up from the nightmare the dreamer merges with the  
waker (if we may so call the one who has woken up) and not ``become'' the  
waker. He alone remains. He does not see the waker but claims himself  
to be the waker. This claiming is साक्षात् कुरुते So also in the  
case of self-knowledge one does not experience or ``become'' the atma;  
but स्वात्मानं  
अद्वयमेव साक्षात्कुरुते owns up his true  
nature as atma.  
  
Shiva's names relating to Tripura are त्रिपुरान्तकः । त्रीणि पुराणि

SA(68). Krishna tells Uddhava that He is Himself Shiva who destroyed  
the three cities त्रिपुरघ्नो धनुष्मताम् BH(11-11-20).  
Meru mountain. The Meru mountain is mentioned in our puranas,  
Mahabharata and Ramayana etc. It is said to be rich in gold and  
other precious jewels and is said to be in the center of the  
earth. The Himalayas are in the southern part of the Jambudwipa  
in whose center is the Meru. The Bharathavarsha (India) is in the  
south of the Himalayas. One of the mountains surrounding the Meru  
is the Mandhara which was used by the gods to churn the ocean of  
milk. Shri Suka mentions this when he gives a description of the  
creation एषं मध्ये इलावृत्ं   
नामाभ्यन्तरवर्षं  
यस्य नाभ्यामवस्थितः सर्वतः सौवर्णः कुलगिरिराजो

मूर्धनि   
द्वात्रिंशत्सहस्रयोजनविततो मूले षोडश्सहस्रं  
तावतान्तर्भूम्यां   
प्रविष्टः । BH(5-16-6). The abodes of the  
gods like Brahma are situated on the peaks of the mountain. Lalita  
is said to reside on one of the peaks of Meru and so gets the name   
सुमेरुशृङ्गमध्यस्था। सुमेरोर्हेमद्रेर्मध्यशृङ्गे तिष्ठतीति  
तत्स्था ।  
शोभने मेरुमध्यशृङ्गे इति वा LS(55).  The sun  
and the moon are said to go round the mountain. Our poets mention this  
fact often. Kalidasa refers to the sun going round Meru in his Raghuvamsa  
(7-24). He says that Aja and Indumati going round the sacred fire during  
their wedding was like the day and the night revolving round Meru  
प्रदक्षिणप्रक्रमणात्कृशानोरुदर्चिषस्तन्मिथुनं चकासे ।  
मेरोरुपान्तेष्विव वर्तमानं अन्योन्यसंसक्तमहस्त्रियामम्।   
Krishna says that He is Meru among the mountains मेरुः  
शिखरिणामहं BG (10-23) and   
धिष्ण्यानामस्म्यहं मेरुः । BH(11-11-21). All these show that meru  
is considered a very holy mountain   
  
कृत्तिवासं- कृत्तिः = bark of a tree , skin, hide   
वासः = dress. Shiva is reputed to be dressed in the bark of  
trees and skins of tiger and elephant. Once some rishis of Daruka  
forest performed a sacrifice. It seems they were very  proud of  
their spiritual accomplishments. Shiva wanted to test their mind-set  
and teach them a lesson. So He passed by in the form of a shabbily  
dressed mendicant. The sages were furious to see the mendicant. From  
the sacrificial fire they created a ferocious elephant and a tiger  
and set them to attack the mendicant. But Shiva killed the animals,  
and wrapped Himself in their skins. The sages were humbled. They  
realised their mistake and surrendered to Shiva. So He gets  
the following names.  व्याघ्रचर्माम्बरः । व्याघ्रचर्म

दुर्वासः । दुर्निरीक्षं वासो गजसिंहव्याघ्रचर्मादिरूपं यस्य  
सः तथा। SS(566).  Kalidasa wonders at Shiva, dressing Himself  
in the bark and skins of animals though He is the supreme lord, and  
profusely showers blessings on His devotees एकैश्वर्ये स्थितेऽपि  
प्रणतबहुफले यः स्वयं कृत्तिवासाः । Malavikagnimitra (1.1).  
  
These incidents show that the Lord is capable of vanquishing his enemies  
with ease. They are meant to warn one like Ravana who takes Him lightly  
that they will have to face dire consequences. But His nature is to  
subdue pride wherever it shows up - be it in an asura like Ravana or god  
like Manmatha or even great rishis who should have known better. This  
is because pride is an obstacle to the spiritual progress. Once they  
realise their mistake and give up their pride Shiva blesses them.  
  
Now a few words about Shiva wearing the bark or skins of animals: First  
this kind of dress, His matted locks etc., proclaim that Shiva is beyond  
all varnas or grades of society - like brahmin, kShatriya etc., - and  
ashramas or stages of life - like student, householder etc.. In other  
words He is an अतिवर्णाश्रमी Such a one is not bound by any rules  
or regulations applicable to any varna or ashrama. He only gave out the  
scriptures to enable us to become mature spiritually  and realise Him.So  
He is known as bhandhu or well wisher बन्धुः । बन्धुकृत्यं  
हिताहितोपदेसं श्रुतिस्मृतिलक्षणं कृतवानिति॥ ᳚स नो  
बन्धुर्जनिते᳚ति श्रुतिः । SS(581). So these very same rules cannot  
bind Him.  The description of Shri Suka in Shri Bhagavatam matches the above  
description of a paramahamsa. It says तत्राभवद् भगवान् व्यासपुत्रो  
यदृच्छया गामटमानोऽनपेक्षः ।  
अलक्ष्यलिङ्गो निजलाभतुष्टः  
वृतश्चबालैरवधूतवेषः । BH(1-19-25).  
  
Secondly, the bark of the tree and the skins that Shiva wears represent the  
cessation of birth. Birth and rebirth have been discussed earlier. We saw  
earlier while discussing the implications of Tripura that one's mistaken  
identity with the body is the cause of all problems starting with karma  
resulting in fruits of karma and then birth(s) to ``enjoy'' the results  
of karma.   The dawn of wisdom will dispel the ignorance about the  
reality and reveal one's true status. This will end the cycle of birth  
and death. Lord's grace can give us the wisdom. So Shiva is called Hara  
हरः ।  
स्व विषय ज्ञानेनाविद्यादेर्हरणाद्धरः । SS(392).  
The late Paramacharya of Kanchipuram had explained the incident of  
Shiva burning the three cities with a smile thus. ``The All-pervasive,  
All-knowing Supreme alone can liberate us from the cycle of birth and  
death by vouchsafing us the jnana to throw off the fetters of this  
restricting human body and to find bliss supreme in the merger of the  
jivatma with the paramatma. Shri Parameswara destroyed Tripura by the  
smile that appeared on His face on a contemplation of the humour of the  
situation. In relation to ourselves, the Tripura is the physical body in  
the three states of sthoola, sookShma and karana. The consciousness of  
these three states of our body can be overcome only when we realise the  
supreme bliss that radiates from Iswara.'' (Acharya's Call-Part1- P251).  
  
The body is the result of prarabdam and another one is just waiting  
around the corner when this drops. So one should not get attached to  
it but be ready to leave it without regret when the prescribed hour  
comes. Instead, one should  use one's lifetime to gain discrimination  
and not chase the shadows. The avadhuta sage tells this to king Yadu  
लब्ध्वा सुदुर्लभमिदं बहुसंभ्वान्ते मानुष्यमर्थदमनित्यमपीह  
धीरः ।  
तूर्णं यतेत न पतेदनुमृत्यु यावन्निःश्रेयसाय  
विषयः खलु सर्वतः स्यात्। BH(11-9-290).  The human body is  
invaluable as it is got after innumerable births. No doubt it is frail  
and impermanent. But it is with this human body alone one can work to  
attain the life's goal. Plants and animals come lower in the rung of  
evolution. They face many limitations. So our shastras say that if one  
fails to properly use the rare human birth but lives to eat and leads a  
hedonistic life-style without a thought about the hereafter he is most  
unwise and incurs incalculable loss. In fact they say that such a one  
is no better than a brute or a tree. Harsh words indeed but they are  
born out of anguish and meant to rub in the point तरवः किं न  
जीवन्ति भस्त्राः किं न श्वसन्त्युत। न खादन्ति न मेहन्ति किं  
ग्रामपशवोऽपरे॥  
  
श्वविड्वराहोष्ट्रखरैः संस्तुतः  
पुरुषः पशुः । न यत्कर्णपथोपेतो जातु  
नाम गदाग्रजः ।   
BH(2-3-18 and 19).  ``Do not trees live? Do not bellows breathe? And  
do not the domestic animals (other than the human beast) take their  
food and indulge in sex? The human beast who has never heard of the  
story of the Lord has been declared to be as good as a dog, swine,  
a camel and a donkey.''  But the Lord who is an ocean of mercy is ready  
to save such a person also if he wants to turn a new leaf and worships  
Him with single minded devotion. Krishna says he will be considered  
a righteous person. BG(IX-30,31)अपि चेत्सुदुराचारो भजते  
मामनन्यभाक्। साधुरेव स मन्तव्यः सम्यग्व्यवसितो  
हि सः ॥  
  
क्षिप्रं भवति धर्मात्मा शश्वच्छान्तिं निगच्छति। कौन्तेय  
प्रेतिजानीहि न मे   
भक्तः प्रणश्यति। The bark and  
animal skins that Shiva wears proclaim this fact symbolically. They  
convey the above assurance that those who turn to Him with devotion  
will be saved from repeated births irrespective of the kind of life  
they might have lived. So Shiva has the following names भेषजम्-  
संसाररोगस्यौषधं भेषजम् VS(578)भवहेतिः- भवः  
संसारः, तस्य हेतिरायुधं संसारच्छेत्ता।᳚भवस्य  
हेत्यै   
जगतां पतय᳚ इति श्रुतिः । SS(272)  
तारकः । तारयति सम्सारादिति तारकः । SA(07)  
तारणः । संसारसागरात्तारयतीति तारणः । VS(337)  
तारः ।गर्भजन्मजरामृत्युलक्षणाद् भयात्तारयतीति तारः ।   
VS(338)तारः । गर्भजन्मजरामरणसंसारमहाभयात्तारयतीति  
तारः ।᳚नमस्ताराय   
नमः शंभवे चे᳚ति श्रुतिः । SS(76)  
भजे दिव्यसन्मार्गबन्धुम्।  दिव्य = divine सन्मार्गबन्धुम् = a  
companion to one who treads the righteous path भजे = I  
worship; means I worship the lord who is a companion to one who takes  
to the righteous path. This line provides more than one interpretation.  
सन्मार्गः । संश्चासौ मर्गश्च सन्मार्गः । means the virtuous  
path: the path trodden by the saints and noble people and that is  
in keeping with the shastric injunctions महाजनो येन गतः स  
पन्थाः । says Mahabharata. It being very difficult to understand and  
interpret the scriptures it is safe to follow the path trodden by the  
great men as they have followed the path and realised the results. The  
guru, in Vivekachudamani, tells the disciple who had approached him  
for instruction that he will show the path which ascetics took for  
crossing samsara संसारसिन्धोस्तरणेऽस्त्युपायः । येनैव याताः  
यतयोऽस्य पारं तमेव मार्गं  
तव निर्दिशामि।   
  
Krishna says that if one chooses to neglect the path laid out by the  
scriptures it will lead to his downfall. So He urges Arjuna to follow  
them यः शास्त्रविधिमुत्सृज्य वर्तते   
कामकारतः । न स  
सिद्धिमवाप्नोति न सुखं न परां गतिम्। ।  
तस्माच्छास्त्रं प्रमाणं ते कार्याकार्यव्यवस्थितौ। ज्ञात्वा  
शास्त्रविधानोक्तं कर्म कर्तुमिहार्हसि। BG.(16-23,24.) For  
those who follow the virtuous path He becomes a friend and guide. But  
for those like Ravana, who out of vanity or arrogance choose the  
prohibited path He is not a friend but metes out severe punishment  
by casting them  into inferior births.   
तानहं द्विषतः क्रूरान्संसारेषु नराधमान् ।  
क्षिपाम्यजस्रमशुभानासुरीष्वेव योनिषु। BG(16.19)  
Sankaracharya explains ``inferior births'' as cruel beings such as tigers,  
lions and the like अजस्रं सन्ततं अशुभान् अशुभकर्मकारिणः  
आसुरीष्वेव क्रूरकर्मप्रायासु  
व्याघ्रसिंहादिषु योनिषु  
क्षिपामि .  Kalidasa prays in the invocatory verse in Malavikagnimitra   
सन्मार्गालोकनाय   
व्यपनयतु स वस्तामसीं वृत्तिमीशः ।   
He prays to lord to remove the ignorance born out of lethargy to enable us  
to  perceive the right path or the virtuous path.  सत् Sat also means  
that which really exists or existence and means brahman अवितथं  
परं ब्रह्म सत्, ᳚सदेव   सोम्येदम्᳚  (छा.उ. ६।१।४।) इति  
श्रुतेः । VS(478). Thus Margabandhu is brahman only सञ्चासौ  
मार्गबन्धुश्च सन्मार्गबन्धुः । Being brahman He is the best  
guide and companion one can get on the way to liberation. The path of  
self knowledge, says Yama, is very difficult to tread upon. It is just  
like walking over the sharp edge of a razor क्षुरस्य धार निशिता  
दुरत्यया दुर्गं पथस्तत्कवयो वदन्ति KU(3-14).The knowledge  
about the Lord is most profound. The means to get it is difficult for the  
unprepared mind.   When one gets struck on the path He (being with us  
all the time and very much within us), like a sign post, points the way to  
the next stage. He is a guide and companion as long as a seeker looks for  
Him. Like the rain bearing clouds He showers His grace on His devotees  
without expecting anything in return.  Mundane bandhus (relatives)  
are the cause of bondage and ensuing misery. In fact they are called  
bandhus only because they bind themselves with us बध्नाति मनः  
स्नेहादिना इति But lord Margabandhu is a unique bandhu who causes  
all bondage to drop off (as He is Sat) सत्सङ्गत्वे निस्सङ्गत्वम्  
says Shri Sankara in Bhajagovindam. So every one prays to Him for getting  
free from bondage त्र्यम्बकं यजामहे सुगन्धिं पुष्टिवर्धनम् ।  
उर्वारुकमिव बन्धनान्मृत्योर्मुक्षीय  
मामृतात्। Ignorance  
is like a thick layer of scum covering our wisdom. When the scum is  
removed the underlying wisdom shines. Wisdom shows the seeker that he is  
himself Margabandhu. The seeker realises there is no where to go and the  
seeking ends.  So He is known as मार्गः । मुमुक्षवस्तं मार्गयन्ति  
इति मार्गः; परमानन्दो येन प्राप्यते स मार्ग  
इति वा  
VS(365). He is sought by people who want liberation. He is the path  
through which one can get infinite bliss. Only by knowing Him liberation  
is attained यं विदित्वा   
अमृतत्वाय कल्पन्ते योगिनो मुमुक्षवः  
स एव पन्थाः मार्गः । ᳚नान्यः  पन्था  
विद्यतेऽयनाय᳚  
इति श्रुतेः । VS(397).  The poet says दिव्य सन्मार्गबन्धुम्  
Why say  दिव्य divya?  The scriptures talk of the paths the jiva  
can take after the fall of the physical body. They are the dark path  
(कृष्ण गतिः )  
and  the bright path (शुक्लगतिः ). The former path is available to  
those who perform duties and sacrifices  prescribed in the vedas. Karmas  
may be performed with desires also (known as sakama karma). One may,  
for example, perform a sacrifice for achieving wealth or property or  
even swarga loka. The karmas done properly produce results without  
fail. One who does the prescribed karmas go to world of manes or  
pitruloka पितृलोकः after death through the dark path.  
One can also do the karmas without any desire (known as  
nishkamakarma). They are done as offering to the Lord and the results  
are accepted as gifts from Him. Such karmas naturally do not have  
a binding effect but result in (चित्तशुद्धिः) purity of the  
mind. So, now one with a purified mind can add meditation or upAsana  
(उपासना ) on the Lord in any chosen form, that is saguna Iswara,  
like Krishna, Rama, Shiva etc. This becomes a powerful combination and  
and gives better results(i.e.) they go to devaloka through the  bright  
path .These are said to be superior worlds as the pleasures enjoyed  
are superior.  एतेषु यश्चरते भ्राजमानेषु यथाकालं  
चाहुतयो ह्याददायन् ।  
तं नयन्त्येताः सूर्यस्य रश्मयो यत्र  
देवानां पतिरेकोधिवासः । MU(1-2-5).  We saw earlier that even  
the worlds of gods are finite and so one who attains such a place has  
to come down and be reborn after his merits are exhausted. So it is not  
considered wise to keep on doing karmas. Those who take to a combination  
of karma and upasana can practise austerities and develop mental maturity  
and detachmant. They go to Brahmaloka through the bright path  
तपःश्रद्धे ये ह्युपवसन्त्यरण्ये शान्ता विद्वांसो भैक्ष्यचर्यां  
चरन्तः ।  
सूर्यद्वारेण ते विरजाः प्रयान्ति यत्रामृतः स पुरुषो  
ह्यव्ययात्मा। MU(1-2-11).  Note the use of the word विद्वांसः ,  
that is they are not yet jnAnis but on the way to become a jnAni. A  
jnani is liberated while alive in this world itself. He is known as a  
jivanmukta (जीवन्मुक्तः ). But those who go to the Brahmaloka study  
vedanta at the feet of Brahma. They get realisation. At the time of  
pralaya they, along with Brahma merge with brahman. They do not return to  
this world. This is what is known as gradual emancipation or kramamukti  
(क्रममुक्तिः ). The lord is a companion and guide to those who take  
to the bright path that leads to Him.  
  
Meaning of the verse. I worship Lord Margabandhu who is eternal, of  
the form of consciousness and bliss, who curbed the pride of Ravana,  
who used Meru the golden mountain as a bow, who wears the bark of a  
tree and skins and who is a companion to those who choose to tread the  
spiritual path leading to liberation.  
  
      ४. कन्दर्पदर्पघ्नमीशं   
      कालकण्ठं महेशं महाव्योमकेशं   
      कुन्दाभदन्तं सुरेशं कोटिसूर्यप्रकाशं   
      भजे मार्गबन्धुम्। शंभो . . .    
      कन्दर्पदर्पघ्नम् -  
कंदर्पः = Manmatha, the god of love दर्पः = arrogance,  
pride, vanity घ्न = used at the end of a word means destroying,  
removing or curing.  So दर्पघ्नं means one who removed or cured  
the pride.  Shiva cured or removed the pride of Manmatha, the god of  
love.  
  
This statement lends itself for more than one interpretation.  
1 - Though formless and without attributes Lord assumes various forms  
such as Shiva, Krishna, Rama, Uma, LakShmi etc., to gladden the hearts  
of His devotees. Words can not adequately describe the beauty of  
these forms. Manmatha is said to be the paragon of beauty. But even  
his famed beauty appears drab and insignificant when one thinks of  
the lord's bewitching form. Shri Suka describes Krishna as साक्षात्  
मन्मथमन्मथः । जगन्मोहनस्य कामस्यापि मनस्युद्भूतः कामः  
साक्षात्तस्यापि मोहक इत्यर्थः ।  BH(10-32-2), that is His beauty  
will cast a spell on Manmatha himself.So where is the question of  
his feeling  proud in the Lord's prescence? In view of this He is  
known as   
सुन्दरः । द्वात्रिशल्लक्षणोपेतः सुन्दरः । ᳚कामाय  
कामरूपिण᳚ इति श्रुतिः । SS(416). Also सुन्दरः ।  
विश्वातिशायिसौभाग्यशालित्वात् सुन्दरः । VS(791). One who is more  
beautiful than anyone else   
सुदेहः । शोभनो देहो यस्य स सुदेहः । ᳚मङ्गलायतनं  
देवं युवानमतिसुन्दरम्। ध्यायेत्कल्पतरोर्मुले सुखासीनं  
सहोमया.'' इति। ᳚शिवान्ये᳚ति श्रुतिः । SS(249)  
शुभाङ्गः - सुन्दरां तनुं धारयन् शुभाङ्गः । VS(586). Also  
शुभाङ्गः - शोभनैरङ्गैर्ध्येयत्वात् शुभाङ्गः । VS(782).  
Saints and devotees have lost themselves in singing about the beauty  
of the lord. Let us savour some samples.  
This description of Shiva is from Navaratnamala by the saint Shri  
Sadasivabrahmendra कंदर्पकोटिशतगुणसुन्दरदिव्याकृतिं  
शिवं वन्दे Shiva's divine form is millions of times more  
beautiful than that of Manmatha.  
Likewise the saint Shri Narayana Tirta in his Krishna Leelatarangini  
repeatedly calls Krishna as कामकोटिसम,  
मनसिजशतकोटिमञ्जुलवेष, मीनाङ्ककोटिमोहन,  
कोटिमदनसुन्दर, जगन्मोहन , that is Krishna is millions of  
times more beautiful than Manmatha. Such being the case his beauty is  
completely eclipsed in the prescence of the Lord: just like the  
feeble light of the stars is lost in the blazing light of the sun.  
Let us look at another example. This one is from Shri  
Krishnakarnamrutam by Lilasukha. He is amazed at the sweet form of  
Krishna and could only exclaim ``Oh! He is sweet,sweet, the very  
embodiment of sweetness.''   
मधुरं मधुरं वपुरस्य विभो-र्मधुरं मधुरं वदनं  
मधुरम्।  
मधुगन्धि मृदुस्मित-मेतदहो मधुरं मधुरं मधुरं  
मधुरम्।   
Shri Vedanta Desika should have had the same sentiment as Shri DikShita  
and addresses the lord at Tirupathy as कन्दर्पदर्पहर सुन्दर  
दिव्यमूर्ते! ``the One whose beautiful form destroys the  
pride of Manmatha'' (in Venkatesa suprabatam).  
The use of the word कन्दर्पः for Manmatha is significant. The  
name means that he was proud right from birth. Even the pride of such  
a being vanishes in the prescence of the Lord.  
2 - We are in the habit of describing things that have no defined  
form or have no form as beautiful if they please our senses. Thus we  
say the weather is beautiful or a smell is beautiful when it is is  
pleasing to our senses. Similarly we describe the nature, for example  
the sun rise, as beautiful because it is colourful and it is also  
cool at that time. We do not call the scene beautiful after a couple  
of hours when the sun is sizzling! In the same way we describe the  
formless Lord as beautiful as He confers bliss on us. Further weather  
etc., can give happiness in a very limited manner, that is for a  
limited time or in a limited quantity only. Soon they tend to pall or  
they will turn sour. So we may not call them really pleasing.  
Considering this Krishna says  
ये हि संस्पर्सजा भोगा दुःखयोनय एव ते  ।  
आद्यन्तवन्तः कौन्तेय न तेषु रमते बुधः । BG(5-22) .  
In sharp contrast the Lord is of the form of unlimited bliss and so  
infinitely beautiful. And it never gets stale. One never gets sated  
with looking at the form. Lilasukha is charmed by Krishna's form and  
describes it in his  Shri Krishnakarnamrutam thus:    
प्रतिपदललिताभ्यां, प्रत्यहं नूतनाभ्यां,  
प्रतिमुहुरधिकाभ्याम् It appears beautiful every time one looks at  
it. It seems ever fresh and  more lovely than it appeared last time  
when one saw it.  
So He is known as सुचारुः - सुतरां दर्शनीयश्चारुः,  
निरतिशय-परमानन्दरूपत्वात्। ᳚विज्ञानमानन्दं  
ब्रह्मे᳚ति श्रुतिः । SS(818). and रम्यः -  
सुखरूपत्वाद्रम्यः । ᳚यो वै भूमा तत्सुखमि᳚ति  
श्रुतिः । SS(924).  
Devi Lalita is known as सर्वाङ्गसुन्दरी - सर्वाणि च तानि  
अङ्गानि च अवयवाः शिरःपाण्यादयः;  
तेष्वन्यूनानतिरिक्तभाववत्त्वात् यथासामुद्रिका-लक्षणं तद्वत्वेन  
सर्वाङ्गसुन्दरी। अथवा सर्वेषामङ्गेषु शरीरेषु  
ब्रह्मस्वरूपतया अत्यन्तप्रेमविषयत्वेन  
सुन्दरपदार्थवदविनाभाववाञ्छाविषयत्वात्  
तथा।  (Lalitatrishati No. 130, Shankara's commentary).  
3 - At a different level we may say that Manmatha was not destroyed  
really as it is said. He came on a mission but failed miserably.  But  
Shiva was in total control of Himself and so could not be shaken. He  
has many names that attest this fact. Some of them are:    
शान्तः - विषयसुखेष्वसङ्गतया शान्तः, ᳚निष्कलं  
निष्क्रियं शान्तम्᳚ (श्वे. उ.६।१९) इति श्रुतेः । VS(582)  
and SS(9)विरागः - विरतो रागो यस्य विरागः ।  
᳚कथमनेनेदृशेन निश्चिनोती᳚ति श्रुतिः । SS(89).  
विरतः - विगतं रतमस्य विषयसेवायामिति विरतः ।   
VS(396)दमः - दमोऽस्यास्तीति दमः । निगृहीतेन्द्रियग्राम  
इत्यर्थः । आत्मारामत्वात्। ᳚न हि स्वात्मारामं  
विषयमृगतृष्णा भ्रमयति᳚ इति शिवरहस्ये॥  
  
᳚नीलकन्ठं प्रशान्तमि᳚ ति श्रुतिः । SS(578). Thus  
Manmatha was no match to Shiva. He totally lost himself in the  
prescence of Shiva. This is said to be the destruction of Manmatha.  
Shiva's anger was a flash and disappeared soon after as is wont with  
noble souls सधूनां क्षणिको कोपः ।  The punishment was a token.  
Shiva yielded to Rati's pleadings and brought Manmatha back to life as  
he has a role to play in the creation   
ईशं - The lord or master, one who is in complete control.  
Relating to the preceding episode of Manmatha this epithet fits Shiva  
perfectly as He conquered him who was famed to be invincible in all  
the three worlds. He made Manmatha feel small and acknowledge Shiva's  
overwhelming superiority   
कालकण्ठम् - काल = black or dark-blue colour कण्ठः = throat.  
This means one whose throat has a dark colour. It refers to  
Shiva whose throat has a bluish hue. This is said to have happened  
after he swallowed the poison that was given out by the serpent  
Vasuki when the ocean was churned by the devas and asuras. Like  
Manmatha in the episode narrated above, the poison also  lost its  
virulence and became impotent in Shiva's prescence. So Shiva has the  
following names   
नीलखण्ठः - नीलः कण्ठे यस्य सः नीलकण्ठः । शिवस्य कण्ठे  
नैल्यं  
विष्ण्वादि-सकलप्राण्यार्तिकर-हलाहल-विषधारणप्रयुक्तम्।---᳚नीलक्ण्ठं  
प्रशान्तमि᳚ति श्रुतिः । SS(5). The name नीलग्रीवः for  
Shiva appears in several places in Shri Rudram. Also:   
श्रीकण्ठः - श्रीः कालकूटजनिता शोभा। तद्वान्कण्ठो यस्य सः ।  
तथा कालकूट-जनित-मालिन्यमपि शोभैव परमेश्वरस्य।  
᳚विकारोऽपि श्लाघ्यो भुवन-भयभङ्ग-व्यसनिन᳚  
इति न्यायात्। अथवा श्रीः विषमेव,  ᳚श्रीर्वेषरचना शोभा  
सम्पत्सरलशाखिषु।वाणीलक्ष्मीलवङ्गेषु विषे बिल्वेऽपी᳚ति  
नानार्तरत्नमाला। तद्वान्कण्ठो यस्येति। SS(118) and SA(16). This  
says that even the dark patch generated by the poison added to the  
beauty of Shiva's throat. This is said in the following verse in the  
Shivamahimna Stotram also   
अकाण्डब्रह्माण्डक्षयचकितदेवासुरकृपा-  
विधेयस्याऽऽसीद् यस्त्रिनयन विषं संहृतवतः ।  
स कल्माषः कण्ठे तव न कुरुते न श्रियमहो  
विकारोऽपि श्लाघ्यो भुवनभयभङ्गव्यसनिनः ॥१४।   
  
The following names of Shiva are based on this incident.   
कालकूटविषादी - हालाहल- विषपानकर्ता कालकूटविषादी ।  
स्कान्दे सनत्कुमारसंहितायां काशिकावनमाहात्म्ये विष्ण्वादिना  
समुद्रमथनं, तदानीं वासुकिमुखात्कालविषोत्पादनं, तेन

तदनु शिवप्रेरीतेन---नाम्ना हस्तेन विषमाहृत्य च  
शिवहस्ते जंबूफलवत्समर्पणं, तदनु- ᳚गृहीत्वा  
भुक्तवाञ्छंभुः कण्ठे नीलोऽभवत्तदा।  
तदाप्रभृति तत्स्थानं हालाशनमिति स्मृतम्।  
शिवोऽभूत्कालभुङ्नाम्ना कालक्ण्ठाख्यकोऽभवदि᳚ति।   
SS(203).  
The story of churning of the ocean is mentioned in the puranas. It  
appears in 8th book of Shrimad Bhagavatam. Some verses from this are  
given for reference   
निर्मथ्यमानादुदधेरभूद् विषं महोल्बणं  
हालाहलाह्वमग्रतः ।संभ्रान्तमीनोन्मकराहिकच्छपात्  
तिमिद्विपग्राहतिमिङ्गिलाकुलात्।  
तमुग्रवेगं दिशि दिश्युपर्यधो विसर्पदुत्सर्पदसह्यमप्रति।  
भीताः प्रजा दुद्रुवुरङ्ग सेश्वरा अरक्ष्यमाणाः शरणं  
सदाशिवम्।   
``Seeing that effervescent, unbearable and irresistible poison  
possessing tremendous force and spreading in all quarters, as well as  
above and below, and finding no protection (anywhere), living beings  
along with their leaders got much frightened and flew for protection  
to Lord Sadasiva (the ever-auspicious one).'' They prayed to Shiva  
to protect them. They said   
देव देव महादेव भूतात्मन् भूतभावन। त्राहि नः  
शरणापन्नांस्त्रैलोक्यदहनात् विषात्॥   
``O god of gods! O supreme deity! the protector, nay, the very  
self of all created beings! save us who have sought refuge in You,  
from this poison that is burning all the three worlds.''  
Shiva saw their plight   
तद् वीक्ष्य व्यसनं तासां कृपया भृशपीडितः ।  
सर्वभूतसुहृद् देव इदमाह सतीं प्रियाम्। Shiva  who was the  
embodiment of mercy was very much affected by their plight and told  
His consort Sati this   
अहो बत भवान्येतत् प्रजानां पश्य वैशसम्। क्षीरोदमथनोद्भूतात्  
कालकूटादुपस्थितम्।   
``How distressing it is, O Bhavani, this calamity that has come  
up on these people from the poison Kalakuta that had appeared during  
the churning of the ocean of milk.''  
आसां प्राणपरीप्सूनां विधेयमभयं हि मे। एतावान् हि  
प्रभोरर्थो यद् दीनपरिपालनम्।   
``Protection must be given by me to these people who are  
concerned about their lives. To protect the afflicted is the main  
concern of the great (who is endowed with power).'' Saying this  
Shiva swallowed the poison He had gathered in His hand   
निशम्य कर्म तच्छंभोः देवदेवस्य मीढुषः । प्रजा दक्षायणी  
ब्रह्मा वैकुण्ठश्च शशंसिरे।   
Observing the benevolent act of Lord Shiva those who approached Him,  
Sati, Brahma and Lord Vishnu praised it.  
  
Refering to this episode of Shiva swallowing the poison and the  
wearing Ganga on His head, the author Shri DikShita says that the Lord  
performed these acts not because the poison was tasty or Ganga has  
purifying power : but only to save the world and because of extreme  
compassion. And these two acts could not have been performed by  
anyone else   
गङ्गा धृता न भवता शिव पावनीति नास्वादितो मधुर इत्यपि  
कालकूटः ।  
संरक्षणाय जगतां करुणातिरेका-त्कर्मद्वयं  
कलित-मेतद-नन्यसाध्यम्। (Brahmatarkastavam)  
महेशम् -  महा is a substitute for महत् meaning big or  
great ईशः is synonymous with ईश्वरः and means lord or  
master महेशः is the name of Shiva महांश्चासावीशश्च  
महेशः । ᳚यः परः स महेश्वरः᳚ इति

other gods like Yama may be lords of their respective quarters and  
have powers but the Shiva is their Lord also. Their lordships and  
powers were given by Him only. And it is to Him only they all rush  
for protection when they see a danger to all, as happened in the  
story just narrated.  
Later on it is said अतः इतरदेवतासाध्यकार्यप्रवर्तकतया  
सर्वत्राप्रतिहतत्वात् महदीशितृत्वमस्येति महेश्वर इति  
स्मृउतः इति। इदं च श्रुतिप्रसिद्धं नाम, ᳚मायिनं तु

श्रुतेः । SA(2)  
महाव्योमकेशम् - महत् =  great or big व्योमन् = sky,  
atmosphere व्योमकेशः is an epithet of Shiva   
व्योमकेशः    गङ्गाधारणसमये व्योमवद्विशालजटावलयरूपः  
केशः अस्येति व्योमकेशः । SS(96) and SA(75).  
While receiving the Ganga when she was coming down from the heavens,  
Shiva spread out His hair which appeared to cover the sky. Hence the  
name. It is also one of Lalita's name व्योमकेशी - व्योमैव  
केशा यस्या विराड्रूपतयाः । व्योमकेशस्य शिवस्य स्त्री वा।  
व्योमैवाल्पं सद्व्योमकम्। अल्पार्थे कप्रत्ययः । तस्येशी ततोऽपि  
व्यापिका वा LS(941). Her (universal form) is larger than the sky.  
This is an additional meaning given for the name and is applicable to  
Shiva also. Because the sky was first created and came from Him only.  
Then other things were created from the sky.Thus Ganga came from the  
same source from which the entire creation started and so the river  
occupies a lofty position in our esteem. Besides it has an unique  
sacredness attached to it that is not attached to any other river or  
even to the rain water that falls from the sky. In fact the rain  
water is considered to be ordinary. It stays for a short time and is  
lost: but Ganga's flow is perennial and is symbolic of His grace.  
Ganga came from the heaven. Her waters came in a big torrent. Because  
the water fell from a great height the stream got scattered into fine  
spray and came down as an immense cloud. Shiva spread out His hair to  
cover the sky so that the cloud of spray got in and was trapped.  
Ganga lost her way and could not come out. This was done to curb her  
pride. She was released again when Bagiratha prayed to Shiva.  
The use of the adjective महा in the word महाव्योमकेशम्   
meaning great or big is significant महाव्योम meaning ``the  
big or the great sky'' is said to distinguish it from the  
``small sky'' that is mentioned in the Upanishads.    
अथ यदिद-मस्मिन् ब्रह्मपुरे दहरं पुण्दरीकं वेश्म  
दहरोऽस्मिन्नन्तराकाश-स्तस्मिन् यदन्त-स्तदन्वेष्टव्यं तद्वव  
विजिञासितव्यमिति। Chandogyopanishad.(8-1-1). What is mentioned  
here is known as Dahara Vidya. Ordinarily people may may find it to  
visualise brahman that is described to be without a form, name or any  
other attributes. It may appear to be something like a vacUm. It is  
the intention of Dahara Vidya to provide them something gross on  
which they can meditate upon.  
Daharam means  small (दहरं अल्पं ) and ब्रह्मपुरं is  
our body. Briefly stated this says that there is a small space within  
the heart in the body in which one can visualise brahman and get all  
his desires fulfilled. The upanishad says that this is because the  
space that is inside the heart encompasses all that is there outside.  
कुन्दाभदन्तम् - कुंदम् = jasmine flower आभः = likeness,  
resemblance दन्तः  tooth. Shiva's teeth are white and  
have the luster or the soft glow like the jasmine flower. They are  
uniform and packed closely like the petals of a jasmine flower. They  
are specifically mentioned as they are in the mouth of the Lord that  
is the birthplace of all sounds, grammar and the vedas. It is said  
that the vedas are the very breath of the Lord. Shiva has several  
names based on this fact. Some are given here   
वाग्विशुद्धः - वाचो वाण्यो विशुद्धा ऋग्वेदादयो यस्य सः  
वाग्विशुद्धः । ᳚अस्य महतो भूतस्य  
निश्वसितमेतद्यदृग्वेदोयजुर्वेद᳚ इत्यादि श्रुतिः ॥  
  
उक्तं च सूत्रकारेण- शास्त्रयोनित्वादिति। विवृतं च  
भाष्यकारेण महतः ऋग्वेदादेः शास्त्रस्य योनिः  
कारणमिति। SS(318)  
कृतागमः - कृता रचिता मुखपञ्चकाद्विनिर्गता आगमाः  
प्रणवादिमहामन्त्राः, ऋगादि सर्ववेदाः, प्रोद्गीतादि  
अष्टाविंशतिसङ्ख्याका आगमाश्च यस्य सः कृतागमः ।  
᳚अस्य महतो भूतस्य निःश्वसितमेतदृग्वेदः इत्यादि᳚  
श्रुतिः । SS(444)  
वेदनिश्वसितः - वेदा ऋग्वेदादयः निश्वसितमिव यथाप्रयत्नेन  
पुरुषनिःश्वासो भवति एवं यस्य स वेदनिःश्वसितः ।  
᳚अस्य महतो भूतस्य निःश्वसितमेवैतदृग्वेद᳚ इत्यादि  
श्रुतिः । SS(733)  
वेदकारः - विद्येते धर्मब्रह्मणी एभिरिति वेदाः आम्नायाः तान् करोति  
निःश्वसितरूपतया उच्चारयति इति वेदकारः । ᳚अस्य महतो  
भूतस्येत्या᳚दि श्रुतिः । SS(887).  
Thus the sacred vedas in the form of His breath are always wafting in  
His mouth and are in constant touch with His teeth making them very  
pure and endowing them with unique sacredness. For these reasons the  
comparison of the teeth with the jasmine flower is to be found often  
in the compositions of the saints and devotees. Some examples are  
given here. Shri Narayana Theertha addresses Krishna as  
कुन्दरदन and कुन्दसुन्दररदन in his Krishna Leela  
Tarangini. (रदः = tooth.) This description of Devi's teeth is  
in Shyamala Dandakam.  
कुन्दपुष्पद्युतिस्निग्धदन्तावलीनिर्मलालोलकल्लोलसंमेलनस्मेरशोणाधरे!  
सुरेशं - सुरः = god or deity. Shiva is the lord of gods like  
Indra, Brahma. He could ward off Yama also. Thus all the gods could  
not assess and understand His greatness and glory.  That is why they  
were naive enough to plan and send Manmatha on that infamous mission.  
He was also worshipped by asuras like Ravana who subjugated the  
devas. He could crush Ravana and make him realise his helplessness  
and finally surrender to Him.There is none equal to Him or greater  
than Him. So Shri Suka salutes Him saying this   
निरस्तसाम्यातिशयेन राधसा स्वधामनि ब्रह्मणि रंस्यते  
नमः । BH(2-4-14)निरस्तं सांयमतिशयश्च यस्य यदपेक्षया  
अन्यस्य साम्यमतिशयश्च नास्ति, तेन राधसा ऐश्वर्येण  
स्वधामनि स्वस्वरूपे ब्रह्मणि रममाणाय (Shridhara's  
commentary). Shri Sadasiva Brahmendra bows to Him saying  
(in Navaratnamala- 12) निस्तुलमहिमानमानतोऽस्मि शिवम्।  
तुलनं = comparison. So he says ``I salute Shiva of  
incomparable glory.''   
कोटिसूर्यप्रकाशम् - कोटि = 10 millions प्रकाश brilliant,  
bright, shining. The Lord shines like a million (infinite) suns.  
There are so many suns and stars in the universe. The Lord gives them  
their brightness and He also shines because of His own glory without  
depending on anyone else. So He has these names   
सूर्यकोटिप्रतीकाशः - सूर्यकोटीनं प्रकाश इव प्रकाशो यस्य सः  
तथा। इयं च अभूतोपमा। अधिकदीप्तिमानित्यर्थः । ᳚नमो  
दीप्ताय दीप्तिरूपिण᳚ इति श्रुतिः । SS(502)  
सुदीप्तः - सर्वप्रकाशकत्वेन प्रमाणं विना सर्वदा दीप्त इति  
सुदीप्तः । ᳚दीप्ताय दीप्तरूपिण᳚ इति श्रुतिः ।   
SS(633)  
महाद्युतिः - महती द्युतिर्बाह्याभ्यन्तरा च अस्येति महाद्युतिः;  
᳚स्वयंज्योतिः᳚ (बृ-उ-४-३-९), ᳚ज्योतिषां  
ज्योतिः᳚ (बृ- उ- ४-४-१६) इत्यादि श्रुतेः । VS (176)  
मरीचिः - तेजस्विनामपि तेजस्त्वात् मरीचिः,  
᳚तेजस्तेजस्विनामहम्᳚, (गीता १०-३६) इति  
भगवद्वचनात् VS(189)  
ज्योतिः -- स्वत एव द्योतयत इति ज्योतिः; ᳚नरयणपरो  
ज्योतिरत्मा᳚, (ना-उ-१३-१) इति मन्त्रवर्णात् VS(877).  
Thus the Lord who is brighter than a million suns, who is eternal and  
never failing is the most dependable one to light our way. Let us  
pray to Him and seek His grace. So भजे =I worship  
मर्गबन्धुम् = the Lord Margabandhu.  
I worship Lord Margabandhu who removed Manmatha's pride, who has kept  
poison in His neck, the great Lord who is more extensive than the  
space, whose teeth have the sheen of the jasmine flower, who is the  
Lord of the gods and who shines like millions of suns.  
  
      ५. मन्दारभूतेरुदारं मन्दरागेन्द्रसारं महागौर्यदूरं   
      सिन्दूरदूरप्रचारं सिन्धुरजातिधीरं भजे मार्गबन्धुम् ।  
      शंभो ..   
This is the fifth and the last verse in the stotram to be followed by  
the  
फलश्रुतिः , a verse that states the benefit of reciting the  
stotram.  
The preceding verses referred to some incidents to be  
found in the puranas. These incidents were used to highlight some  
qualities of Shiva. They also mentioned some aspects of His form, like  
the moon and Ganga on His head.  Of course the references are to His  
सगुण aspect or aspect with name and form as Shiva. In His  
निर्गुण aspect He is without name, form and qualities. These  
references brought out the greatness of the Lord like His compassion,  
readiness to come to the help of the distressed etc. Thus, He  
destroyed Manmatha because he commited a serious offence. But when  
entreated by Rati (Manmatha's wife) He readily granted his life back.  
This shows His infinite compassion.  
Whatever be the name or form by which we choose to address Him, be it  
Shiva or Rama or Hari, we find that His qualities  are endearing and  
draw one to Him. Shri Kulasekara states this in this popular verse in  
his Mukundamala (No:18) as follows   
वात्सल्या-दभयप्रदानसमया-दार्तार्ति-निर्वापणात्   
औदार्या-दघशोषणा-दगणित-श्रेयःपदप्रापणात् ।   
सेव्यः श्रीपतिरेक एव सततं सन्त्यत्र षट् साक्षिणः   
प्रह्लादश्च विभीषणश्च करिराट् पाञ्चाल्यहल्या ध्रुवः ॥   
मन्दारभूतेरुदारं -  
मन्दारः = It is the name of one of the five trees in Indira's  
paradise. It is said to be capable of granting one's desires like the  
famed Kalpa tree, also of the paradise भूतिः = grandeur,  
dignity, riches उदारम् = generous, liberal. So the word   
मन्दारभूतेरुदारं means that Lord Shiva is more generous in  
granting one's wishes than the Mandara tree. So He is known as  
कामप्रदः - भक्तेभ्यः कामान् प्रकर्षेण ददातीति कामप्रदः ।   
VS(298). He gives all that His devotees may need in abundance. Shri  
Vedanta Desika cites the case of Kuchela as an example and says  
धानामुष्टिमुचे कुचेलमुनये दत्ते च वित्तेशताम् । meaning  
that He made His devotee Kuchela rich as Kubera in return for a  
handful of pounded rice he offered Him.  
He is also known as वरदः - अभिमतान् वरान् ददातीति वरदः ।   
VS(330). He grants boons desired from Him. Also वरदः  
भक्तानामिष्टप्रदः । ᳚वरदं देवमीड्य᳚ मिति  
श्रुतिः । SS(107). And उदारः - भक्ताऽभीष्टदः  
सर्वोत्कृष्ट  
उदारः । ᳚आप्ततममुत्कृष्टतम᳚ मिति श्रुतिः ।   
SS(315).  
Saint Sadasiva Brahmendra calls Him as नतमन्दार       -  
``the  
wishing tree of heaven'' in his song भज रे गोपालम् - Bhaja  
re Gopalam. Again he calls Him as सेवकजनमन्दिरमन्दार -  
``the Mandara tree planted in the residential quarters of His  
devotees'' in the song मानस संचर रे - Manasa sanchara  
re.  
We find the mantra नमो वृक्षेभ्यो हरिकेशेभ्यः in the eighth  
anuvaka of Shri Rudram. The explanation states that Rudra, who can  
take any form, has assumed the form of trees to help the world. He  
stands in the form of Palasa, Bilwa, Peepal and  other holy trees  
which can be used in sacrifices for gaining heaven and the form of  
heavenly trees like Kalpaka, Mandara, Parijata etc., which grant all  
wishes. So He gets the following names   
पारिजातः - पारमस्यास्तीति पारि, समुद्रः, तस्माज्जातः पारिजातः  
देववृक्षः, तद्रूपत्वाद्देवोऽपि पारिजातः, भक्तजनेष्टद  
इत्यर्तः । SS(264) and वृक्षाणां पतिः - वृक्षा  
अश्वत्थादयः,  
तेषां पतिः स्वामी । ᳚वृक्षाणां पतये नम॑ इति श्रुतिः ।  
  
SS(692).  
The tree is one of the creations. May be it is in the heaven and so  
has some special features unlike those found here in this world. But  
places like the heaven are only finite. Gods like Indra who rule  
there are also finite though they may be known as अमराः . The  
tree Mandara also has a limited life. Since it has only a limited  
life, whatever it can give will also have limited life and perish  
eventually giving cause for unhappiness or sorrow. In view of this  
Krishna names those who seek petty favours (which are finite only)  
from Mandara and even gods like Indra, Brahma etc.,  as men of small  
intellect. He says   
अन्तवत्तु फलं तेषां तद्भवत्यल्पमेधसाम् । BG(7-23).  
Sankaracharya, in his commentary, points out that एवं समाने अपि  
आयासे मामेव न प्रतिपद्यन्ते अनन्तफलाय, अहो खलु कष्ठतरं  
वर्तते, इत्यनुक्रोशं दर्शयति भगवान् । ``though there  
is  
the same amount of exertion (in the two kinds of worship), people do  
not resort to Me so that they may attain infinite results. Alas! it  
is very miserable'' -thus the Lord expresses His anguish. This is  
the reason for calling them as ``men of small intellect.''  
But, unlike the tree, the Lord is नित्यः eternal as said in verse  
No. 3. He is not subject to decay etc., as the tree. So He is capable  
of granting finite material benefits like good health, wealth etc..  
  
besides  liberation or mokSha (i.e.) that is ever lasting or  
infinite. In fact He is willing to give Himself to His devotee.  
स्मरतः पादकमल-मात्मानमपि यच्छति । BH(10-80-11). This  
idea is repeated by Shri Kulasekara in his Mukundamala (31)सेव्ये  
स्वस्य पदस्य दातरि सुरे नारायणे तिष्टति । The infinite thing  
obviously includes the finite things. The true devotees know this and  
so do not seek benefits that are finite from Him. The Lord  
is very dear to them and they are very dear to Him प्रियो हि  
ज्ञानिनोऽत्यर्थमहं स च मम प्रियः । BG(7-17). So He  
naturally  takes care of them. Has not He said तेषां  
नित्याभियुक्तानां योगक्षेमं वहाम्यहम् ? ``To them who are  
ever devout, I secure them gain and safety.'' BG(9-22). Here  
योगः and क्षेमः ``gain and safety'' is explained by  
Shri Sankara as योगः अप्राप्तस्य प्रापणं, क्षेमः तद्रक्षणं,  
तदुभयं प्रापयामि अहम् । . (i.e.) Gain implies securing what is  
not already possessed; and safety means preservation of what is  
alreday possessed. Shri Sankara adds that while the lesser devotees  
work themselves for  their gain and safety the true devotees do not.  
The Lord alone is their refuge. Wherefore the Lord Himself secures to  
them gain and safety केवलं एव भगवच्छरणाः ते; अत  
भगवान् एव तेषां योगक्षेमं वहतीति । . Thus the true devotees  
do not lack anything. If their be any lack, it is taken care of by  
the Lord. The safety of their possessions is also taken care of by  
the Lord. What more can one desire?  They are carefree and therefore  
relaxed. The Tamil saint Manikkavachakar said that the Lord was more  
concerned about him than the mother of her new born child. He said  
that He anticipated his needs and fulfilled them. The brahmin Kuchela  
was another such devotee. Outwardly he appeared to be very poor but  
inwardly he was very rich: he  was totally contented and never felt  
any want यदृच्छ्योपपन्नेन वर्तमानो गृहाश्रमी ।   
BH(10-80-7).  
मन्दरागेन्द्रसारम् -  
मन्दरः = is the name of a mythical mountain अगः = mountain.  
इन्द्रः = the first or the best (of any class of objects). So the  
word मन्दरागेन्द्र means Mandara, the best among the mountains.  
सारं = strength.  
Mandara was used by the gods  and demons to churn the ocean to get  
the nectar. It is said to be situated adjacent to the mountain Meru.  
मन्दरो मेरुमन्दरः सुपार्श्वः कुमुद इति अयुतयोजन विस्तारोन्नाहा  
मेरोश्चतुर्दिशमवष्टम्भ गिरय उपकॢप्ताः । Of the four  
sides  
of Mount Meru stand the Mandara, Merumandara, Suparswa and Kumuda  
mountains forming its buttresses (as it were) and having a length and  
height of 10,000 yojanas. BH(5-16-10). Shiva is said to be as strong  
as Mandara, the best among the mountains. He is unmovable, like a  
mountain सर्वगतः स्थाणुः अचलः - सर्वगतत्वात् स्थाणुः इव  
स्थिरः इत्येतत् । स्थिरत्वात् अचलः अयं आत्मा । Because He is  
all  
pervading, He is stable like a pillar. Because He is stable He is  
firm.BG(2-24). The proof is that the mighty Ravana tried to lift His  
abode Kailasa and was crushed. But His unlimited strength is not  
demoniac but it is mellowed with kindness: so when Ravana realised  
his mistake and pleaded, He pardoned him and let him go. So He is  
known as महाबलः- बलिनामपि बलवत्त्वात् महाबलः । He is  
stronger than those who are said to possess great strength.  
VS(172)  
महाबलपरः- महद्बलं शारीरं सामर्थ्यं सैन्यरूपं वा  
येषां ते महाबलाः, इन्द्रोपेन्द्रप्रभृतयः तेषां परः  
श्रेष्ठः परमेश्वरः । ᳚तमीश्वराणां परमं  
महेश्वर᳚मिति श्रुतिः । SS(604). In fact He is known as   
अद्रिः- अद्रिवदप्रकम्प्यः, परैरचल इति यावत् । ᳚तं  
शान्तमचल᳚मिति श्रुतिः । यद्वा  
श्रीशैलारुणाचलादिपर्वतरूपत्वादद्रिः । श्रीशैलशिखरं

शंभुर्गिरयश्च शंभु᳚रिति स्कान्दे । ᳚सर्वो ह्येष

महीधरः- महीं गिरिरूपेण धरतीति महीधरः, ᳚वनानि  
विष्णुर्गिरयो दिशश्च᳚ (विष्णु-२-१२-३८) इति  
पराशरोक्तेः । VS(369). He held up Mandara during the churning of  
the ocean and lifted the Govardana mountain as Krishna. So He gets  
the name महाद्रिधृक्- महान्तमद्रिं गिरिं मन्दरं  
गोवर्दनं च अमृतमथने गोरक्षणे च धृतवानिति  
महाद्रिधृक् ॥ VS(180).  
The fact that He is mightier than the mightiest and has compassion  
makes Him the ideal protector.  Shri Vedanta Desika has expressed this  
idea beautifully in his works   
अभीति हेतोरनुवर्तनीयं नाथ त्वदन्यं न विभावयामि ।   
भयं कुतः स्यात् त्वयि सानुकंपे रक्षा कुतः स्यात् त्वयि जातरोषे ॥   
(Ashtabhujashtakam - 5)  
त्वयि रक्षति रक्षकैः किमन्यैः त्वयि चारक्षति रक्षकैः किमन्यैः ।   
इति निश्चित धीः श्रयामि नित्यं नृहरे वेगवती तटाश्रयं त्वाम् ॥   
(Shri Kamasikashtakam - 8).   
He asks: ``When one is protected by You what use is there of  
other protectors? Again,  
when You are angry and decide to punish someone, what use is there of  
other protectors?''  This reminds us of the famous incident of  
Kakasura in Ramayana.  
The asura misbehaved with Sita when she was in the forest with Rama.  
Rama was furious at his conduct and sent an arrow that chased him  
wherever he went. He ran to Indra, Brahma etc., for protection.  
But they hurriedly turned him away when they  
learnt that he had incurred Rama's wrath and is being hunted by  
Rama's arrow. Finally, feeling helpless, he surrendered to Rama  
Himself who forgave him readily. This incident was mentioned by Sita  
to Hanuman. She said   
त्रीन् लोकान् संपरिक्रम्य तमेव शरणं गतः ।   
स तं निपतितं भूमौ शरण्यः शरणागतम् ।   
वधार्हमपि काकुत्स्थः कृपयापर्यपालयत् ॥   
(Ramayana. Sundara Kanda. 38-32,3).   
Great asuras like Ravana obtained wonderful boons from Brahma and  
other gods.  With those powers they could subdue the three worlds.  
They were very proud of their powers and were convinced they were  
invincible and safe. But in the end they found themselves helpless  
when their time was up. Ravana bemoans this fact when he sees his  
army being decimated in the fight with Rama   
अहो सुबलवान् रामो महदस्त्रबलं च वै ।   
यस्य विक्रममासाद्य राक्षसा निधनं गताः ।   
तं मन्ये राघवं वीरं नारायणमनामयम् ॥ (Yuddha kanda  
72-10,11).   
In contrast young devotees like Prahlada were under His protection.  
They faced trials and tribulations with the assurance that the Lord  
will protect them. So no harm could befall them.  
We also referred to the episode of Markandeya being saved by Shiva  
from the jaws of death and mentioned that one of His names is  
मृत्युञ्जयः SS(123) and SA(71). Shri Ramana Maharshi explains  
how the Lord Mrityunjaya saves His devotees from death. He puts it in  
a unique way in his work Sat-darsanam. He says   
मृत्युञ्जयं मृत्युभियाश्रिताना-   
महंमतिर्मृत्युमुपैति पूर्वम् ।   
अथ स्वभावादमृतेषु तेषु   
कथं पुनर्मृत्युधियोऽवकाशः ॥   
The Maharshi says that when a devotee seeks the protection of the  
Lord from fear of death He protects him by destroying the individual!  
This sounds alarming and confusing. But what the Maharshi means is  
that normally one identifies himself with the body-mind complex and  
not the Self that is one's true nature. Thus the individual feels  
separate from the Self which is immortal and not subject to  
destruction. This separative idea is formed in the individual's mind.  
As long as one cherishes this mistaken notion one is in the grip of  
the viscious samsara. He is subject to repeated birth and death. This  
wrong notion that makes one to identify himself with the body is  
known as ahamkara or ego. When one surrenders himself to Lord  
Mrityunjaya who is very much in everyones heart the ahamkara loses  
itself. It is only a chimera that thrives as long as one's ignorance  
of his true nature persists. The Lord's grace confers the wisdom that  
destroys the ignorance. Consequently the ego gets stripped of all its  
coverings and ceases to be the ego. Rid of the ego the Self shines in  
its pristine glory. The individual finds his original nature and thus  
he goes beyond birth and death. He  becomes immortal.  
महागौर्यदूरम्- महा = great गौरी = is the name of  
Parvati महागौरी means great or glorious Gauri अदूरम् = close  
by, not far away दूर = distant or far off.  
Gauri or Parvati is the consort of Shiva and is said to take up half  
of His body. In view of this it is said here that She is not far off  
from Him. So Shiva is known as अर्धनारीश्वरः- नार्या अर्धं  
अर्धनारी, अर्धनारीमिलित ईश्वरः अर्धनारीश्वरः ।  
नार्यंशोऽर्धमीश्वरांशश्चार्धमित्यर्तः ।  
तदुक्तमाचार्यैः-

देहार्धकान्तः- देहस्य अर्धं वामभागः, कान्तात्मकः यस्य सः

᳚दरिद्रन्नीललोहोत᳚ इति श्रुतिः ॥ SS(568).  
Krishna has said पिताऽहमस्य जगतो माता धाता पितामहः ।    
BG(9-17).  
``I am tha father of this world, the mother, the dispenser of the  
fruits of action and the grandsire.'' That He is both the father  
and the mother is symbolised by the Ardhanari form. Kalidasa says  
this in the invocatory verse to his great poem Raghuvamsam   
वागर्थाविव संपृक्तौ वागर्थप्रतिपत्तये ।   
जगतः पितरौ वन्दे पार्वतीपरमेश्वरौ ॥   
``I salute Parvati and Parameswara who are the parents of the  
universe and who are inseparably united like the speech and the  
sense, for obtaining the correct knowledge of the words and their  
meaning.''  
Thus Krishna says that He is both the intelligent cause and the  
material cause of the creation. He is  
कत्रा - क्रियत इति कर्म जगत्तस्य कर्ता, ᳚यो वै बालाक  
एतेषां पुरुषाणं कर्ता यस्य वै तत् कर्म स वेदितव्यः ।''  
कौ-उ-४-१४ इति श्रुतेः । VS(316).  
करणं - जगदुत्पत्तौ साधकं करणम् । VS(378)  
कारणं - उपादानं निमित्तं च कारणम् । VS(379)  
विकर्ता - विविधं भुवनं क्रियते इति विकर्ता स एव भगवान्  
विष्णुः । VS(381).  
The material cause is also known as prakriti which Krishna called as  
His inferior aspect in BG Chapter 7. Prakriti is also called maya  
that deluding power of Iswara   
मायां तु प्रकृतिं विद्यान्मायिनं तु महेश्वरम् । SVU(4-10).  
Prakriti is maya and the Lord Maheswara is in control of it.  
Krishna says that His maya is very powerful and very hard to  
overcome दैवी ह्येषा गुणमयी मम माया दुरत्यया । BG(7-14).  
``This divine illusion of Mine, made up of gunas, is hard to  
surmount.'' So He is known as महामायः - मायाविनामपि  
मायाकारित्वात् महामायः, ᳚मम माया दुरत्यया᳚ इति  
भगवद्वचनात् । VS(170).  
Krishna says that in fact He is both: the intelligent cause and the  
material cause called prakriti. Thus मूलप्रकृतिः is one of His  
names मूलभूता प्रकृतिः मूलप्रकृतिः, जगदादिकारणं,  
तन्निमित्तोपादानत्मकं ब्रह्मेत्यर्तः । ᳚तदैक्षत, बहुस्यां  
प्रजायेति᳚ इति श्रुतिः ॥  
  
ऐक्षतेति ईक्षणकर्तृत्वान्निमित्तकारणत्वं, बहुस्यामिति  
बहुभवनहेतुत्वादुपादानत्वम् ॥ SS(411). Also प्रकृतिः -  
जगदुपादानभूतः परमेश्वरः प्रकृतिः । अयमर्तः सूत्रकारेण  
निश्चितः ।प्रकृतिश्च प्रतिज्ञा,  
दृष्टान्तानुपरोधादित्यादिसूत्रपञ्चकेन । विवृतं चेदं  
भाष्यकारेण संशयपूर्वपक्षप्रदर्शनपूर्वकम् ॥ SS(570)  
मायाबीजः - मायाया बीजं कारणमधिष्ठानमिति यावत् । एवं च  
मायाया अध्यस्तत्वेन वास्तवताऽभावात् शक्तित्वेन  
स्वातन्त्र्याभावाच्च जगत ईश्वरैक्यबीजत्वमुपपद्यते ।  
᳚देवात्मशक्तिं स्वगुणैर्निगूढामि᳚ ति  
श्रुतिः ॥ SS(557).  
The prakriti mentioned as the mother is symbolised as the Lord's  
consort and is variously called as Parvati, Ambika, Gauri, Bhavani,  
LakShmi etc..  प्रकृति, विष्णुपत्नी, नारायणसमाश्रिता are  
names of LakShmi to be seen in LakShmi Ashtottarashatanama stotram.  
Thus  
the Lord as brahman is one but, as Iswara and Devi appears as two.  
This is stated beautifully in the उमामहेश्वरस्तोत्रम्   
(Umamaheswara stotram) as follows   
नमः शिवाभ्यां नवयौवनाभ्यां परस्पराश्लिष्टवपुर्धराभ्याम् ।   
I salute the two Shivas who are eternally young and whose bodies are  
entwined with each other.  
Krishna also adds that we the created beings are in the clutches of  
prakriti and go through the cycle of birth and death till wisdom  
dawns on us but He is beyond it and maya, however powerful it may be  
has no influence on Him. So He is known as   
मायातीतः - मायाया अतीतः - मायया वा अतीतः ।   
सत्वादि-गुण-सामान्यरूप-प्रकृतिविवर्जित इत्यर्तः ।   
᳚अतमस्कममायमि᳚ति श्रुतिः ॥ SS(41). and   
निर्मायः - मायाया निर्गतः निर्मायः । यद्यपि ᳚मायां तु  
प्रकृतिं विद्यान्मायिनं तु महेश्वरं᳚ इति मायासंबन्दः  
श्रुतिषु दृश्यते, तथापि मायायाः कल्पितत्वेन  
वास्तवसंबन्धाभावात् कल्पितसंबन्धपरेयं श्रुतिः । अत  
एव,  
व्यक्तात्पुरुषः परः, अक्षरात्परतरः, अविद्याकार्यहीनः ।  
᳚अतमस्कम्मायमि᳚ति श्रुतिः ॥ SS(693).  
Bartruhari states the fact that the Lord is not in the clutches of  
maya in his own way in his Vairagyasatakam.(17)   
एको रागिषु राजते प्रियतमादेहार्धहारी हरो  
नीरागेषु जनो विमुक्तललनासङ्गो न यस्मात् परः ।    
He says that among sensual persons Shiva is unique sharing half His  
body with His beloved. It appears from this that as though He cannot  
bear separation from her even for a second. But, he adds, that again  
among the dispassionate there is none superior to Him, unattached to  
the company of women.  
The prakriti is subservient to Him. This is depicted in our puranas  
by showing Parvati and LakShmi as serving the Lord with great  
dedication. For example, Devahuti, the daughter of Manu, is said to  
have served her husband, sage Kardama, with the same delight as  
Goddess Parvati looks after Her consort, Lord Shiva नित्यं  
पर्यचरत् प्रीत्या भवानीव भवं प्रभुम् । BH(2-23-1).  
The following names are thus derived from the facts stated above   
पार्वतीपतिः -  पर्वतः हिमवान् तस्य पुत्री पार्वती । तस्याः पतिः ।  
तदुक्तं सूतसंहितायं-  
᳚ सा शिवा करुणामूर्तिर्जगन्माता त्रयीमयी । शिवाभिन्ना  
परानन्दा शङ्करस्यापि शङ्करी᳚  
स्वेच्छया हिमत्पुत्री स्वभक्तजनवत्सला, तस्याः पतिः प्रियः  
परमेश्वरः ॥ ᳚अम्बिकापतय उमापतये नमो नमः᳚ इति  
श्रुतिः ॥  SS(24) and   
अम्बिकापतिः - पार्वत्याः प्रियः अम्बिकापतिः ।  
᳚हिरण्यपतयेऽम्बिकपतय᳚ इति श्रुतिः ॥ SS(429).  
Also SA(15)  
गौरीशः - गौरीशोऽम्बिकापतिः ॥ SS(121)  
श्रीपतिः - अमृतमथने सर्वान् सुरासुरादीन् विहाय श्रीरेनं  
पतित्वेन वरयामासेति श्रीपतिः । श्रीः पर शक्तिः, तस्याः  
पतिरिति वा, ᳚परास्य शक्तिर्विविधैव श्रूयते᳚  
(श्वे-उ-८) इति श्रुतिः । VS(603).  
श्रीशः - श्रिय ईशः श्रीशः । VS(606)  
जगत्पिता - जगन्निर्माता- ᳚इदं सर्वमसृजते᳚ ति  
श्रुतिः । SS(36)  
विश्वमाता - विश्वस्य माता व्यापी  ज्ञाता वा । SS(85)  
जगद्धाता - जगतां धाता कर्ता । SS(86)  
मातामहः - मातुः पिता मातामहः, चतुर्विधभूतग्रामस्य  
पार्थिवस्य मात पृथिवी, तस्याः पिता मातामहः । ᳚स  
भूमिमसृजते᳚ ति श्रुतिः । पृथिव्या मातृत्वे ᳚इयं  
वै माते᳚ ति श्रुतिः । SS(615).  
Devi Gauri is called महा or great or glorious because of Her  
greatness.  
But one has to remember that She is dependant on Him for Her  
greatness. Shiva's greatness is revealed by the fact that He married  
Her though She was only the daughter of the mountain Himavan. This  
marriage conferred greatness on Parvati and Himavan also. Similarly  
as Vishnu He married LakShmi, the daughter of the ocean, and  
conferred honour on LakShmi and the ocean also. This is stated  
symbolically in our puranas.  
For example, DakShayani wanted to attend and participate in the  
sacrifice organised by Her father DakSha.  Shiva told Her not to go  
and warned that if She disregarded His advice and went to the  
function She will meet with humiliation. But She went to the function  
overriding His advice only to be  met with a barrage of insults in  
the assembly. Unable to bear the insult, She sacrificed Her body and  
was reborn as Parvati. She had to perform severe penance to please  
Shiva and married Him again.  
A similar incidence is narrated in Ramayana also. Sita spent happy  
days with Rama in the forest till She saw the the golden deer and  
became infatuated with it. She sent Him away from Her to capture it.  
This invited trouble for Her. The moment Rama turned His back on Her,  
Ravana appeared on the scene and carried Her away to Lanka. She was  
incarcerated for a long time and suffered greatly   
सिन्दूरदूरप्रचारम् - सिन्दूरम् = red lead दूर = distant,  
far off प्रचारम् = going away. That is, Shiva's complexion is  
very red and it outshines the colour of the red lead.  
Shri Rudram says असौ यस्ताम्रो अरुण उत बभ्रुः सुमङ्गलः ।   
This  
says that Rudra is ताम्रः = copper coloured, अरुणः = rosy,   
बभ्रुः = golden yellow, सुमङ्गलः = highly auspicious and  
beneficient. Only a few can understand and worship the avyakta or  
impersonal God. A larger number can contemplate Rudra as residing on  
Kailasa. For the benefit of the others, who form the majority of  
mankind, He stands in the form of the sun. The sandhya vandana mantra  
says सूर्य आत्मा जगतः तस्थुषश्च = the sun is the self of  
the world, movable and immovable. The sun is the most acclaimed and  
worshipped power of nature. It is said that असौ यस्ताम्रो इत्यनेन  
आदित्यमुपतिष्टते । The votary should praise and worship the sun  
by  
means of the rik असौ यस्ताम्रो in the Rudram. So ताम्रः -  
अत्यन्त-रक्तस्ताम्रः । ᳚नमस्ताम्राय चे᳚ ति श्रुतिः ॥  
  
  
SS(572) is one of His names.  
Also He is compassionate. The quality is represented by the red  
colour. So His form is suffused with that colour. He is known as  
दयाळुः - दयाशीलो दयाळुः । अनेन परमेश्वरस्य या शान्ता तनू  
सर्वह्लादरूपिणी सा प्रदर्सिता । ᳚या ते रुद्र शिवा तनू᳚  
रिति श्रुतिः SS(155)  
सिन्धुराजातिधीरं- सिन्धुः = the sea, ocean राजन् = a king  
or chief. It is used to qualify something very great or glorious. For  
example Kalidasa describes the Himalaya as नगाधिराजः in his  
Kumarasambhava.  अति = a prefix used to mean very, too,  
exceedingly etc धीरं = strong minded, wise, resolute.  
सिन्धुराज meaning the chief of the oceans : indicates a mighty  
ocean. The Lord is very resolute, wise and strong minded like a  
mighty ocean.  
Kalidasa defines धीरः as one who is endowed with a mind that  
does not waver even when assailed by deleterious forces that are  
capable of  perverting it विकारहेतौ सति विक्रियन्ते येषां न  
चेतांसे त एव धीराः ॥ (Kumarasambhava-1-59). Gita and the  
upanishads use the word to mean a person of wisdom or discrimination.  
  
देहिनोऽस्मिन्यता देहे कौमारं यौवनं जरा ।   
तथा देहान्तरप्राप्तिर्धीरस्तत्र न मुह्यति ॥ BG(2-13).   
Just as in this body the Self passes into childhood and youth and old  
age, so  
does He pass into another body. The wise man has no delusions in this  
regard and so is not troubled in the mind. Arjuna had delusion in  
this regard. He admitted in the end that his delusion had been  
destroyed as a result of Krishna's teaching. He said   
नष्टो मोहः स्मृतिर्लब्धा त्वत्प्रसादान्मयाऽच्युत ।   
BG(18-73).   
Again   
यं हि न व्यतयन्त्येते पुरुषं पुरुषर्षभ ।   
समदुःखसुखं धीरं सोऽमृतत्वाय कल्पते ॥ BG(2-15).   
Here Krishna says a wise man who is not afflicted by pleasure and  
pain is  
fit for immortality. Such a man of wisdom is called as  
धीरः and also as स्थितप्रज्ञः, स्थितधीः etc..  
  
The upanishads use the word धीरः to indicate a man of wisdom  
and realisation. This example is from Kathopanishad   
एको वशी सर्वभूतान्तरात्म एकं रूपं बहुधा यः करोति ।   
तमात्मस्थं येऽनुपश्यन्ति धीराः तेषां सुखं शाश्वतं   
नेतरेषाम् ॥ KU(2-2-12).   
``The indwelling Lord of all beings; who is one without the  
second and has everybody under His control; transforms His one and  
single entity into multifarious; those wise persons who always  
observe (meditate upon) that Lord abiding in self; (it is they who)  
enjoy that eternal bliss; not the others.''  
One other interpretation of the word is धीरः - धियं  
ईरयति, धियं प्रेरयति । ईर = to urge, elevate, bring to  
life. Thus the word धीरः means the Lord who is behind the  
intellect and gives life to it. We worship Him through the Gayatri  
mantra as धियो यो नः प्रचोदयात् । Shiva is known as  
गायत्रीवल्लभः - गायत्र्या वल्लभो  
गायत्रीवल्लभः ।गायत्रीप्रतिपाद्य इत्यर्थः । SS(179).  
The avaduta sage lists the similarities between a realised man and  
the ocean in his conversation with the king Yadhu. The story is seen  
in Shri Bhagavata.  He says:   
मुनिः प्रसन्नगम्भीरो दुर्विगाह्यो दुरत्ययः ।   
अनन्तपारो ह्यक्षोभ्यः स्तिमितोद इवार्णवः ॥   
समृद्धकामो हीनो वा नारायणपरो मुनिः ।   
नोत्सर्पेत न शुष्येत सरिद्भिरिव सागरः ॥ BH(11-8-5 and 6).    
The conversation is narrated by Krishna in His advice to Uddhava.  
The avaduta says: The sage should be placid and profound, difficult  
to fathom and to cross over, illimitable and immovable, like the  
ocean with its mass of waters at rest. And whether he has an  
abundance of enjoyable things or he has none, the sage, who has set  
his heart upon the Lord, neither overflows nor shrinks, like the  
ocean on account of the waters of the rivers.  
These verses say that a jnani's mind is clear. He is mature and  
गंभीरः deep or profound. Describing the qualities of Rama,  
Narada tells the sage Valmiki that Rama was profound like the  
ocean समुद्र इव गांभीर्ये । (Balakanda-1-17).  
The sage will appear to be simple, but his depth of knowledge and  
maturity cannot be  measured:  दुर्विगाह्यः . Because of his immense  
wisdom he cannot be overcome or overpowered. He is firm. He is beyond  
time and space as he has found he is अनन्तः and अपारः । .  
अपारः means shoreless. A jnani is limitless and all pervading as  
he has found his true nature स्वरूपम् . He is unshakeable; this  
refers to his emotional strength. On this point Krishna says   
दुःखेष्वनुद्विग्नमनाः सुखेषु विगतस्पृहः ।   
वीतरागभयक्रोधः स्थितधीर्मुनिरुच्यते ॥ BG(2-56).   
His heart is not distressed in calamities. It does not long for  
pleasures. He is free from attachment, fear and anger. He is called a  
sage, a man of steady knowledge.  
The sage is not disturbed by his experiences, be they favourable or  
unfavourable. King ParikShit was such a person. He was born in the  
royal family and brought up in the lap of luxury. He was said to be  
calm and serene like Lord Shiva प्रसादे गिरिशोपमः ।   
BH(1-12-23). But adversity hit him hard in the form of a curse. He  
had only seven days left to live. But though he was initially upset,  
he gathered his wits and immediately started thinking of what he  
should do next. He renounced his kingdom, went to the banks of Ganga  
and sought the advice of sages about what one in his condition should do.  
The jnani has realised his fulness पूर्णत्वम् . So he has no wants.  
His sensory experiences are like the rivers: they may bring in flood  
waters or may dry up. But the ocean does not swell or shrink in size.  
It retains its fullness. This is with reference to material  
possessions also. So whether he owns all desirable possessions  
समृद्धकामः or has none, he treats both situations like  
नारायणपरः gifts from God. Ramayana gives a fine example in  
Rama for this. He was to be made the king but this was not to be. He  
was asked to go to the forest instead. But this sudden change of  
fortune did not upset Him in the least. Valmiki says:   
न वनं गन्तुकामस्य त्यजतश्च वसुन्धराम् ।   
सर्वलोकातिगस्येव लक्ष्यते चित्तविक्रिया ॥ (Ayodhya Kanda -19-33).   
No change of mood was perceived in him,-any more than in a (master)  
yogi who surpasses all (common) men (because of his having risen  
above all pairs of opposites),- even though he was ready to retire to  
woods and was renouncing the sovereignty to the globe.  
The man of wisdom does not become arrogant or depressed. Rama was said  
to be like this सर्वदाभिगतः सद्भिः समुद्र इव सिन्धुभिः ।   
Bala (1-16). He was always sought by the righteous even as the ocean  
by the rivers. The commentators explain that just as the ocean  
maintains its level even when rivers flow into it, Rama was  
level-headed even though sadhus were regularly calling on HIm. He did  
not become proud.  
It emerges then, that in the case of a man of wisdom real possessions  
are not material possessions and adversity is not poverty. Prosperity  
for him is remembrance of the Lord and calamity is forgetting Him   
संपदो नैव संपदः विपदो नैव विपदः ।   
विपद् विस्मरणं विष्णोः संपद् संस्मरणं हरेः ॥   
It is possible that in adversity one's weakness shows up and all  
thoughts of Lord recede into the background. But this does not happen  
in the case of a true devotee. He is not daunted by reverses. In fact  
Kunti, the mother of the Pandavas found from experience that  
calamities made her think of Him and so she prayed that she should be  
regularly visited by them!   
विपदः सन्तु नः शश्वत्तत्र तत्र जगद्गुरो ।   
भवतो दर्शनं यत्स्यादपुनर्भवदर्शनम् ॥ BH(1-8-25).   
A jnani has realised his oneness with God. So there is no question of  
his forgetting Him.  
So, let us pray to the great Lord Margabandhu to show us the way.  
भजे मार्गबन्धुम् ;- भजे = I worship मर्गबन्धुम् = the  
Lord Margabandhu.  
  
In this verse the poet uses four similies to glorify Shiva's generous  
nature, His strength, His complexion and His wisdom. Talking about  
figures of speech one has to note that they are used by poets to  
highlight some quality or emphasise some thing. This works all right  
with the things in the universe (i.e.) with finite things. But when  
one tries to use similies while talking about God who is not finite  
but infinite they fail. The desired effect cannot be produced. One  
cannot find something equal to or greater than Him. Shri DikShita says  
this in his poem Varadarajastavam   
यस्मिञ्जहात्यतिशयोक्तिरलंक्रितित्वं   
न्यूनोपमात्वमुपमा समुपैति सर्वा   
सूक्ष्मस्वभावकलनापि च न प्रतर्क्या   
तद्वर्णयामि भवतः कथमाभिरूप्यम् ॥   
He says that one cannot describe His beauty directly, or by comparing  
it with a like object or by exaggeration. Describing it directly is  
not possible because His form is very subtle and cannot be grasped by  
words. There being none equal to it, one cannot use a simile and  
offer a comparison. Also one cannot use exaggeration to highlight His  
form. For example Kalidasa says that King Dilipa was tall like a  
tree साल प्रांसुः : Raghuvamsa (1-13). This makes nice reading  
and sounds definitely better than saying that  Raghu was  
exceptionally tall. But exaggeration will not work when talking about  
His qualities as nothing can excel them.  Still poets resort to the  
use of the figures of speech as with the worldly objects while  
praising Him. This is done in their enthusiasm to sing His glory and  
we accept it in the right spirit.  
  
Meaning of the verse. I worship Lord Margabandhu who is more generous  
than the divine Mandara tree, who is stronger than the Mandara  
mountain, who is close to the great Gauri, who is of crimson colour  
and who is more profound than the mighty ocean.  
  
      ६. अप्पय्ययज्ज्वेन्द्र गीतं स्तोत्रराजं पठेद्यस्तु भक्त्या प्रयाणे  
      तस्यार्थसिद्धिं विधत्ते मार्गमध्येऽभयं चाशुतोषो महेशः ।  
      शंभो ...  
अप्पय्य = the name of the author यज्वन् = performer of  
sacrifices गीतं = sung स्तोत्रराजं great poem पठेत्  
= reads यः = whoever भक्त्या = with devotion   
प्रयाणे = during a journey तस्य = for him.  अर्थ = wish,  
desire सिद्धिः = fulfilment, complete attainment विधत्ते = arranges.  
मध्यः = middle or central part मार्गमध्ये on  
the way अभयं = freedom from fear, security आशु = fast,  
quick तोषः = satisfaction, pleasure, delight.  
आशुतोषः means one who is easily pleased महेशः = name  
of Shiva.  
This verse gives the benefit or the fruit of reciting the poem and is  
known as फलश्रुतिः । फलं means the fruit, the result or the  
reward. The author says that one who reads the poem with devotion  
during a journey will be successful and attain his goal or wishes. In  
addition he will feel secure and be protected by the Lord on the way.  
What is the nature of the Lord? He is महेशः the Lord of the  
lords like Indra and Brahma. It is to Him that they all rush when  
they are confronted by fear or serious danger. This name was  
explained in verse No. 4 where it occurs. But though He is the  
supreme Lord a devotee can easily please Him by offering items that  
can beobtained without difficulty. He is known by following names:    
सुलभः - पत्रपुष्पफलादिभि-र्भक्तिमात्रसमर्पितैः सुखेन  
लभ्यत इति सुलभः । ᳚पत्रेषु पुष्पेषु तोयेषु   
अक्रीतलभ्येषु सदैव सत्सु । भक्त्येक-लभ्ये पुरुषे पुराणे  
मुक्त्यै कथं न क्रियते प्रयत्नः ॥᳚ इति महाभारते ॥   
VS(817). He is easily pleased by offering some leaves, flowers or  
fruits. The lowly woman Sabari could please Lord Rama by offering Him  
some fruits she had gathered in the forest. Krishna accepted with  
great delight some pounded rice which the poor brahmin Kuchela  
brought Him.  
Shri Krishna says that His devotees can attain the highest results by  
just offering a leaf, a flower, a fruit or water   
पत्रं पुष्पं फलं तोयं यो मे भक्त्या प्रयच्छति । तदहं  
भक्त्युपहृत- मश्नामि प्रयतात्मनः ॥ BG(9-26)  
Shiva is known as: करवीरप्रियः - करवीरप्रियत्वं शिवस्य  
पुराणादिषु प्रसिद्धम् ।  
᳚एकेन करवीरेण सितेनाप्यसितेन वा । हरिं हरं वा  
संपूज्य ब्रह्मभूयाय कल्पते᳚ इति ।  
अनेन शिवपूजस्यां सौलभ्यमुक्तम् । शिवः पूजनीय इति च ॥   
SS(326).  
भक्तानां सुलभः - शिवपूजादिपराणां सुलभः,  
शीघ्रमनुग्राहकः । तदर्तमेव शिवमूर्तिग्रहणम् ॥ SS(484).  
One of Shri Lalita's names also states this fact सुखाराध्या -  
सुखेन उपवासादिरूपकायक्लेशं ध्येयस्वरूप-   
नियमननिर्बन्धादिकं चान्तरेणाप्याराध्या ॥ LS(680). Prahlada  
says that it does not need much effort to please Him. One need not  
strain himself and go on pilgrimages etc., in search of Him   
न ह्यच्युतं प्रीणयतओ बह्वायासोऽसुरात्मजाः । आत्मत्वात्  
सर्वभूतानां सिद्धत्वादिह सर्वतः ॥ BH(6-6-19). He is the very  
Self of every being and He is available everywhere.  
There is an apocryphal story that once the author Shri DikShita was  
preparing to go to a nearby village on some work  when he received  
information that some people who were ill disposed to him were  
hatching a diabolical plot to attack and kill him on the way. The  
poet composed this stotram and prayed to the Lord to ensure his  
safety during the journey. As a result the enemies could not carry  
out their plan and Shri DikShita could complete his travel in complete  
safety. We too can recite this stotram and be protected by the Lord  
in our travels.  
It is our tradition to mention the फलश्रुतिः or the fruits of  
reciting or listening to stotras or puranas or other holy texts. This  
is usually said in the end of the text but sometimes is mentioned in  
the beginning of the  text or in both places. The purpose of the  
फलश्रुतिः is to interest one in reading or listening to the  
composition. The author in this case had lead a religious life. He  
had  built two templesin his native village.He had performed  
several sacrifices as is expected of a brahmin.  So he gets the  
appellation dikShita appended to his name. He also states this fact  
by calling himself as यज्वन् . The Manusmrithi states that  
performing sacrifices is one of the duties of a brahmin   
अध्यापनमध्ययनं यजनं याजनं तथा । दानं प्रतिग्रहं  
चैव ब्राह्मणानामकल्पयत् ॥   
Kalidasa says that the kings of the solar dynasty tended the  
sacrificial fires by means of offerings and honoured the guests also.  
यथाविधि हुताग्नीनां यथाकामार्चितार्थिनाम् । (Raghuvamsa-1-6).  
Manu further says that the noble ones should eat only the remains of  
this yagna as only it is worth eating. One who cooks for himself eats  
sin   
अघं स केवलं भुङ्क्ते यः पचत्यात्मकारणात् ।  
यज्ञशिष्टाशनं ह्येतत्सतामन्नं विधीयते ॥   
Krishna talks at length about various kinds of sacrifices in Gita (in  
chapter IV). He eulogises the performance of sacrifices by saying  
यज्ञशिष्टामृतभूजो यान्ति ब्रह्म सनातनम् । नायं  
लोकोऽस्ययज्ञस्य कुतोऽन्यः कुरुसत्तम ।   
Eating the ambrosia, the remnant of the sacrifice, they go to the  
eternal brahman. Even this world, which is common to all beings is  
not for one who does not perform the sacrifices mentioned. How can  
there be to him another world which can be secured only by superior  
means? (BG 4-31).  
The Lord Himself is called yagna यज्ञः- सर्वयज्ञस्वरूपत्वाद्  
यज्ञः;᳚यज्ञो वौ विष्णुः᳚ (तै-सं-१-७-४)  
इति  
श्रुतेः । VS(445). Also यज्ञः- सर्वयज्ञस्वरूपत्वाद्यज्ञः ।  
᳚त्वं यज्ञस्त्वं विष्णु᳚रिति श्रुतिः ॥ SS(160).  
The performance of prescribed duties or what is known as karmas is  
necessary to get purification of the mind. This is thenecessary  
first step in the path of spiritual progress चित्तस्य शुद्धये  
कर्म says Shri Sankaracharya in his Vivekachudamani.  
He defines such a person who has been regularly performing the  
sacrifices as noble minded महात्मानः अक्षुद्रचित्ताः in his  
commentary (BG-19-13). Anandagiri elaborates the definition as  
महान् प्रकृष्टो यज्ञादिभिः शोधित आत्मा सत्वं येषां -  
those whose minds have been purified by sacrifice etc.  
Such a person who is sincere, performs the duties expected of him and  
is broad minded is known as आप्तः - आप्तः यथार्तवक्ता । - a  
credible, trustworthy person. Such persons speak from experience. So  
we need not question their sincerity but accept what they say as the  
truth with complete faith. Thus our tradition says आप्तवाक्यं  
प्रमाणम् ।   
Great men act and speak for the good of the world only. They have no  
axes to grind.  
King ParikShit mentions this point when he greets the great sages who  
had come to see him in his last days   
समागताः सर्वत एव सर्वे वेदा यथा मूर्तिधरास्त्रिपृष्ठे ।  
नेहाथवामुत्र च कश्चनार्थ ऋते परानुग्रहमात्मशीलम् ॥   
The king said ``shining like the vedas you have all come together  
from every quarter. You have no purpose of your own in this world (to  
achieve) in this world or in the next, except doing good to others ,  
which is your innate disposition.'' BH(1-19-23).  
Shri Sankaracharya also talks about this trait of great men:   
शान्ता महान्तो निवसन्ति सन्तो वसन्तवल्लोकहितं चरन्तः । तीर्णाः  
स्वयं भीमभवार्णवं जनानहेतुनान्यानपि तारयन्तः ॥   
(Vivekachudamani).  
There are good souls, calm and magnanimous, who do good to others as  
does the spring, and who, having crossed this dreadful ocean of birth  
and death, help others also to cross the same, without any motive  
whatsoever   
गीतं = sung, chanted. The poet says that he had sung the poem.  
Does it mean he had not composed it? For example, one of the  
definitions of the word भगवद्गीता is that it was sung or  
chanted by Krishna: श्रीमता  भगवता गीता . This implies that  
He was not the author of the work (न कृता ) but was merely  
repeating what had been said by someone else earlier.  Krishna  
Himself told Arjuna that  He had imparted the same teaching long back  
to the Sun (Vivasvat) at the commencement of evolution by Him. This  
was then handed down in regular succession among the royal sages (men  
who were at once kings and sages). Thus it was an ancient teaching.  
The text may be different but the contents are essentially the same.  
They can be found in the upanishads also. One of the Gita Dhyana  
states this:   
सर्वोपनिषदो गावो, दोग्धा गोपालनन्दनः । पार्थो वत्सः,  
सुधीर्भोक्ता, दुग्धं गीतामृतं महत् ॥   
The upanishads are like the cows. Gopala is the one who milks them.  
Partha (Arjuna) forms the calf. The pure minded one is the partaker  
and the supreme nectar Gita is the milk.  
In the same manner, in this case also the poet had glorified the Lord  
by stringing together some of His attributes. These attributes are to  
be found in the puranas etc., and so were known long back. Also the  
fact that singing the glories of the Lord will confer great benefits  
is also known from time immemorial. In the introduction to the Vishnu  
Sahasranama Bhishma tells Yudhishtira:    
I willtell you some of the renowned names of the Lord culled from  
various  sources (such as the vedas and puranas) by great sages.  
These names will confer all merits   
यानि नामानि गौणानि विख्यातानि महात्मनः । ऋषिभिः परिगीतानि तानि  
वक्ष्यामि भूतये ॥   
Thus, the use of the word ``sung'' (गीतम्) seems  
appropriate.  
Why this piece is called स्तोत्र राजा a great or splendid piece of  
work? In the beginning of Chapter 9 of Gita, Krishna talks of the  
knowledge of brahman and to glorify the subject He calls it  
राजविद्या राजगुह्यम् । ``the sovereign science, the sovereign  
secret.''  
It is called sovereign because it talks of brahman and not of any  
lowly subject. It shows the way to wash off one's sins and attain  
brahman. Similarly this stotra glorifies the Lord who is brahman, who  
is limitless and thus supreme. It does not talk of some thing that is  
inferior or perishable like a monarch or gods like Indra and Brahma  
who are all in the clutches of time.  
It says then पठेद्यस्तु भक्त्या प्रयाणे तस्य अर्थसिद्धिं  
विधत्ते । (i.e.) whoever reads this with devotion during a journey,  
the mission will be completed successfully. The emphasis is on the  
word भक्त्या - with devotion. This implies that such great hymns  
should not be read or chanted mechanically, by rote but with  
devotion. One should put his heart and mind in it.  Bhishma says so  
in theintroduction to Vishnu Sahasranama : ``Among the dharmas  
prescribed the one I am going to say namely, worshipping the Lord by  
singing His glories with devotion is, I consider the best.''  
एष मे सर्वधर्माणां धर्मोऽधिकतमो मतः । यद्भक्त्या  
पुण्डरीकाक्षं स्तवैरर्चेन्नरः सदा ॥   
This is in reply to King Yudishtira's question to him  ``which  
among the dharmas or duties you have mentioned is , according to you  
the best?'' को धर्मः सर्वधर्माणां भवतः परमो  
मतः?   
Bhakti (devotion) while chanting the names of the Lord is mentioned  
more than once in the end after the stotram also. For example it is  
said: भक्तिमान् यः सदोत्थाय शुचिस्तद्गतमानसः । सहस्रं  
वासुदेवस्य नाम्नामेतत् प्रकीर्तयेत् ॥१२५।  
इमं स्तवमधीयानः श्रद्धाभक्तिसमन्वितः ।  
युज्येतात्मसुखक्षान्ति-श्रीधृतिस्मृतिकीर्तिभिः ॥१३२॥  
  
Shri Sankaracharya , in his commentary, says:   
भक्तिमानित्यादिना भक्तिमतः शुचेः  
सततमुद्युक्तस्यैकाग्रचित्तस्य श्रद्धालोर्विशिष्टाधिकारिणः  
फलविशेषं दर्शयति । Thus a great deal of emphasis is laid  
on devotion and faith. The Lord is  अनिमिषः । always awake  
VS(215) and on the look-out for people who have devotion. He has  
innumerable number of ears, eyes, mouths etc. सर्वतः  
पाणिपादं तत् सर्वतोऽक्षिशिरोरुहम् । सर्वतः श्रुतिमाल्लोके  
सर्वमावृत्य तिष्ठति ॥ SU(3-6). His (as Ganesa) ears are big  
and very sensitive. With them He can hear even prayers muttered  
softly. With His long proboscis He can detect even the faintest aroma  
of piety. He loves sincere prayers offered by His devotees and  
blesses them. He has the name: स्तवप्रियः VS(680). This does not  
mean that He loves adulation. He has no need for it. It is we who  
benefit by singing His glories.  
It was said पठेद्यस्तु भक्त्या प्रयाणे तस्य अर्थसिद्धिं  
विधत्ते मार्गमध्येऽभयंच आशुतोषो महेशः ।   
(i.e.) whoever reads this with devotion during a journey, the Lord  
will ensure that the mission is completed successfully. In addition  
he will feel secure as he will be protected by the Lord on the way.  
We noted that the word प्रयाणम् means departure,or journey. But  
if we scratch a bit deeper we find that the word also means death or  
departure from this world. This latter meaning puts the statement in  
a different perspective and introduces a very important topic viz.,  
the last moments of one's life and how it is to be managed.  Both  
प्रयाणकालः and अन्तकालः mean the same thing. The  
Bhagavatha Purana is very relevant in this context as it deals with  
this subject elaborately. It presents case histories of the last  
moments of many people to illustrate the theories that are stated in  
it. This subject is introduced by Krishna at the end of chapter 7 of  
Gita and dealt with in detail in the next chapter.  He says   
अन्तकाले च मामेव स्मरन्मुक्त्वा कलेबरम् । यः प्रयाति स मद्भावं  
याति नास्त्यत्र संशयः ॥   
Who at the time of death, thinking of me alone, leaves the body and  
goes forth, he reaches My being; there is no doubt in this. BG(8-5).  
And;  
यं यं वापि स्मरन्भावं त्यजत्यन्ते कलेबरम् । तं तमेवैति  
कौन्तेय सदा तद्भावभावितः । BG(8-6).  
Thinking of whatever Being at the end a man leaves the body, Him  
alone, O son of Kunti, he reaches by whom the thought of that Being  
has been constantly dwelt upon. The word Being may mean any personal  
God (इष्ट देवता) (like Shiva or Devi) other than Krishna or  
any friend or relative or anything else (may be his house or bank  
balance or even  his pet) that had been occupying the person's  
thought. This is mentioned in the upanishad also.  
कामान्यः कामयते मन्यमानः स कामभिर्जायते तत्र तत्र ।  
पर्याप्तकामस्य कृतात्मनस्त्विहैव सर्वे प्रविलीयन्ते कामाः ॥   
MU(3-2-2).  
An example is to be found in the story of the sage Bharatha that is  
familiar to all. This is told in the fifth book of Bhagavatham. The  
great king ruled over the entire country. It is because of him that  
the country has come to be known as Bharatam अजनाभं  
नामैतद्वर्षं भारतमिति यत आरभ्य व्यपदिशन्ति   
BH(5-7-3). The king was  - महाभागवतः a great devotee of the  
Lord.  After ruling the country for a long time he handed over the  
kingdom to his sons and retired to the forest. There, in the forest,  
he devoted his time in the worship of the Lord and derived great  
satisfaction. But he developed an infatuation for a fawn. His mind  
got diverted from the worship of the Lord. He was engrossed in  
protecting and caressing the young deer. Even as he was spending his  
time playing and protecting the deer the hour of death approached  
him. He died looking on the deer intently.  
तदानीमपि-पार्श्ववर्तिनं आत्मजमिवानुशोचन्तं अभिवीक्षमाणो  
मृग एवाभिनिवेशितमना विसृज्य लोकमिमं सह मृगेण  
कलेवरं मृतमनु न मृतजन्मानुस्मृतिः  
इतरवन्-मृगशरीरमवाप ।   
As a consequence he was reborn as a deer. BH(5-8-27).Shri Suka says in  
anguish that Bharatha, a great devotee, instead of attaining the  
supreme goal , died like other common people and was reborn.  
A person with unfulfilled desires at the time of death gets the birth  
suitable to the fulfilment of the desires. So to one who wants to  
avoid rebirth Krishna says:    
तस्मात्सर्वेषु कालेषु मामनुस्मर युध्य च ।  
मय्यर्पितमनोबुद्धिर्मामेवैष्यस्यसंशयः ॥ BG(8-7)  
Therefore at all times you meditate on Me and fight; with mind and  
reason fixed on Me you shall doubtless come to Me alone. . Here  
``fight'' means doing one's alloted duty.  
This means that if one thinks of Him in his last moment he will  
attain Him. ``Attaining'' means realising Him by knowing His  
true nature. Krishna says this a bit later in clarification. He says  
--   
पुरुषः स परः पार्थ भक्त्यालभ्य-स्त्वनन्यया । BG(8-22).  
That Purusha, O Arjuna! within Whom all beings dwell, by Whom all  
this is pervaded, may be won by means of exclusive devotion. Shri  
Sankaracharya in his explanation says that ``exclusive  
devotion'' means exclusive devotion, characterised by jnana or  
knowledge of the self. स भक्त्या लभ्यस्तु ज्ञानलक्षणया  
अनन्यया आत्मविषयया । is to be noted. Why should  
``devotion'' should be characterised by jnana? In answer he  
refers to what was said earlier (in verse 7-17). The jnani is the  
best devotee as he is exclusively devoted to Him तेषां ज्ञानी  
नित्ययुक्त एकभक्तिर्विशिष्यते Of them (the four types of  
devotees mentioned in verse No.16) all, the knower, ever steadfast  
and exclusively devoted excels. Shri Sankaracharya says that the wise  
man knows the truth and so is steadfast. He is exclsively devoted;  
for none else is seen deserving of devotion.  
Attaining Him means liberation from the repeated cycle of birth and  
death. Bhishma mentions this fact as he lay dying on the bed of  
arrows. Krishna was present by his side . He prepared to shed his  
body at the auspicious time since he had the power to do so. He  
praised Krishna for His kindness to be present by his side at the  
crucial moments.  He says:   
भक्त्याऽऽवेश्य मनो यस्मिन् वाचा यन्नाम कीर्तयन् । त्यजन्  
कलेवरं योगी मुच्यते कामकर्मभिः ॥ BH(1-9-23).  
A yogi who casts off his body with his thought fixed on Him through  
devotion and chanting His name with his tongue is rid of all  
hankerings and released from the bondage of actions.  
Then Bhishma stopped the wanderings of his senses and praised the  
Lord   
निवृत्त्सर्वेन्द्रियवृत्तिविभ्रमस्तुष्टाव जन्यं  
विसृजन्जनार्दनम् । BH(1-9-31).  
The first verse he said in praise of the Lord shows that he had shed  
his attachments and he was surrendering his pure mind to Him   
इति मतिरुपकल्पिता वितृष्णा भगवति सात्वतपुङ्गवे विभूम्नि ।  
स्वसुखमुपगते क्वचिद् विहर्तुं प्रकृतिमुपेयुषि यद्  
भवप्रवाहः ॥ BH(1-9-32).  
He said that on the eve of his departure from this world he offers  
his mind which is free from all thirst for worldly enjoyment to the  
Supreme Lord. He begins by saying इति - ``thus or in this  
manner.'' ``In this manner'' means ``in the manner as  
advised by You.'' Has not Krishna promised earlier that: ''  
with mind and reason fixed on Me you shall doubtless come to Me  
alone?''  मय्यर्पितमनोबुद्धि-र्मामेवैष्यस्यंशयः ॥   
Thus Bhishma said that he was offering his mind that was free from  
all hankerings to Him and was thus qualified for liberation.  
Now, because such attainment of the Lord is the ultimate goal one can  
desire, saints pray to Him to bless them with His thoughts in their  
last moments. Thus Lilasuka prayed:   
व्यत्यस्तपाद-मवतंसित-बर्हिबर्हं,  
साचीकृतानन-निवेशित-वेणुरन्ध्रम् ।  
तेजः परं परमकारुणिकं पुरस्तात्,  प्राणप्रयाण-समये मम  
सन्निधत्ताम् ॥   
He prays that he should be blessed with the vision of his favourite  
God Krishna that is at once bewitching and radiant, and a picture of  
kindness, standing with His legs crossed,  decorated with a peacock  
feather tucked in His hair, playing the flute with His slightly  
inclined head,in his dying moments.  
Now, Krishna says that by thinking of Him in one's last moments one  
can escape death and get relief. So can one be ``smart'' and  
think of Him only in his last moments but after leading a wayward or  
a ``busy'' life that had left him no time to think of the  
world to come?  
``No,'' say our scriptures and saints. The reason is that the  
last moments can be very traumatic for a variety of reasons. As one  
grows old and infirm his will power becomes steadily weaker. His  
subconscious is saturated with numerous thoughts. These thoughts will  
take over and his free will will not be able to function. If a person  
had laboured hard  chasing ``success'' in life, accumulating  
wealth and all the appurtenances that go with it then he would have  
developed strong bonds with all of them. The thought of having to  
leave all those hard earned possessions behind will  be hovering in  
his mind and be very painful. Thus he will die thinking of his money  
and perhaps worrying how all that is going to be managed in his  
abscence. Or one may be very attached to his family members. The  
thought that he will soon be whisked away from them can be very  
excruciating and occupy his mind at that critical moment. Or it is  
possible that one may live long but may be overcome by debility and  
sickness in the old age. The suffering can be so intense that any  
other thought is rendered impossible.  
Further no one can predict precisely when  the end will come. So it  
is not possible to plan and work on thinking of the Lord  in the last  
moments.  
Thus, there can be many reasons for not being able to think of Him.  
So one should practise thinking of Him right from young age and at  
all the time possible. In this way the mind, slowly but steadily,  
gets saturated with the thought of God. Then there is a good chance  
of the thought surfacing at the right time. The words अन्तकाले च  
 literally mean ``in the final moments also.'' The  
``also'' means, not only the final moments, but also the time  
preceding the  crucial moments - ``all through the life'' as  
then only one can expect to be blessed with the thought of the Lord.  
The devotee Kulasekara prays   
कृष्ण त्वदीय-पद-पङ्कजपञ्जरान्तः, अद्यैव मे विशतु  
मानस-राजहंसः ।  
प्राणप्रयाणसमये कफ-वात-पित्तैः, कण्ठावरोधनविधौ  
स्मरणं कुतस्ते ॥   
He prays to Krishna that his mind should now itself surrender to Him.  
He asks how it will be possible to think of Him in the final moments  
when the throat will be choked with phlegm etc. and consequently  
there will be acute suffering. The celebrated vaishnavite saint  
Periazhwar makes a similar request. He says that the last moments  
will be painful. His physical strength will be depleted. His  
faculties will not be functioning properly. In such a situation he  
will not be able to think of Him. Because of these reasons he says  
that he is surrendering to the Lord now itself when the body has  
strength and mind is functioning properly.  
Then what happens to the atheist who keeps himself busy earning for  
himself, his family  with no thought of the hereafter and perhaps  
leads a sybaritic life? It is a sad situation, say our scriptures.  
Lord Kapila in His advice to His mother Devahuti gives a graphical,  
albeit terrifying picture of the last moments of such a person. He  
says:   
वायुनोत्क्रमतोत्तारः कफसंरुद्धनाडिकः । कासश्वासकृतायासः  
कण्ठे घुर्घुरायते ॥   
(At the approach of death) his eye-balls are shot out by the action  
of the life-breath trying to find an exit: his wind-pipe gets choked  
with phlegm, coughing and breathing cause him exertion and  
death-rattle is heard from his throat.  
शयानः परिशोचद्भिः परिवीतः स्वबन्धुभिः ।  
वाच्यमानोऽपि न ब्रूते कालपाशवशं गतः ॥   
Lying (in his bed) surrounded by his sorrowing relations and caught  
in the noose of Death, he cannot utter a word even when addressed.  
एवं कुटुम्बभरणे व्यापृतत्माजितेन्द्रियः । म्रियते रुदतां  
स्वनामुरुवेदनयास्तधीः ॥   
Thus a man of uncontrolled senses, who is absorbed exclusively in  
worldly concerns, dies with a mind afflicted and stupified, and with  
his relatives standing by, crying with grief.  
Further it is said that in the case of such person the memory of the  
present life slowly fades. The प्रारब्धम् pertaining to the next  
birth is ready to take over and the person gets a vision of the next  
birth to come. In addition, Sage Kapila says that, the person will  
also have a vision of the messengers of Death who have come to lead  
him away from this world.  
यमदूतौ तदा प्राप्तौ भीमौ सरभसेक्षणौ । स दृष्ट्वा  
त्रस्तहृदयः शकृन्मूत्रं विमुञ्चति ॥   
He then sees before him two emissories of Yama, huge in size and  
menacing with their terriffic eyes. The sight makes him shudder and  
evacuate in fear. BH(3-30. 16 to 19). Kapila says further:    
एवं कुटुम्बं बिभ्राण उदरम्बर एव वा । विसृज्येहोभयं  
प्रेत्य भुङ्क्ते तत्फलमीदृशम् ॥   
Thus a man who lives his life entirely for the pleasure of his body  
and for the support of his family is wrenched away from both and  
subjected to the sufferings of purgatory. BH(3-30-30).  
एकः प्रपद्यते ध्वान्तं हित्वेदं स्वकलेवरम् ।  
कुशलेतरपाथेयो भूतद्रोहेण यद् भृतम् ॥   
The body which a man has nourished by exploiting and inflicting  
cruelty on other creatures, he will have to abandon here and go alone  
to hell with the wages of his sins as his sole asset. BH(3-30-31).  
केवलेन ह्यधर्मेण कुटुम्बभरणोत्सुकः । याति  
जीवोऽन्धतामिश्रं चरमं पदम् ॥   
A man who lives in this world merely for supporting himself and his  
family by thoroughly unrighteous means will certainly reach  
Andhatamisra, the hell of utter darkness. BH(3-30-33).  
अधस्तान्नरलोकस्य यावतीर्यातनाधयः । क्रमशः समनुक्रम्य  
पुनरत्राव्रजेच्छुचिः ॥   
Then attaining again to this world, he passes through various animal  
bodies one after another as part of his punishment until, having paid  
for his sins, he is purified. He is then born again as a man.  
BH(3-30-34).  
Now, let us hear the same thing from the horse's mouth.Yama the god  
of death told the boy Nachiketa:    
न साम्परायः प्रतिभाति बालं, प्रमाद्यन्तं वित्तमोहेन  
मूढम् ।  
अयं लोको नास्ति पर इति मानी, पुनः पुनर्वशमापद्यते मे ॥   
KU(1-2-6).  
Hypnotised by the attraction of wealth he fails to take notice of the  
other world. For him the visible world is everything.and there is  
nothing like the other world (heaven or hell). Such a person comes  
within my clutches again and again.  
Having gone through the above material about the ``last  
moments''  let us seek the answers to the following questions:    
1- why does one fear death?  
2- when do the ``last moments'' begin?  
3- how shoud one prepare himself for the ``last moments?'' and  
4- how much time the preparations will require?  
  
We will try to answer the questions here.  
1- why does one fear death?  
One can be expected to fear or abhor or shun some experience if he  
had had previously tasted it and found it unpleasant or painful. But  
death can not be such an event. One could not have experienced death  
earlier in this very life and carry on the experience of it in the  
same life. We find that even insects try to avoid death. Because of  
this reason our scriptures say that this fear is inherited from  
previous births. The sage Patanjali mentions this in his Yogasutras  
and calls the fear  अभिनिवेशः । He says that the fear affects  
the wise people also.  
स्वरसवाही विदुषोऽपि तथारूढोऽभिनिवेशः । साधनपादः-९।   
स्वस्य रसेन संस्कारेणैव वहतीति स्वरसवाही ।  
अपिशब्दसमुच्चितमविद्वांसं तथेति तच्छब्दः  
परामृशति ।  
रूढः प्रसिद्धः । तथाच यथाऽविदुषः तथा विदुषोऽपि  
स्वरसवाहित्वहेतुना यज्जातीयः यत्क्लेशो भयाख्यः  
प्रसिद्धोऽस्ति सोऽभिनिवेश इत्यर्थः । विदुषामपि  
मरणत्रासकृतं भयमस्तीति भाष्यकृतोक्तम् ।  
पूर्वपूर्वजन्मसु  
मरणकाले यत्रासो जातो ᳚मा न भूवं भूयासम्᳚  
इत्युत्कण्ठारूपो भयनामा तज्जनित-संस्करमात्रा-  
दविदुषामिवा- त्मविदामपि स जायते, न तत्राविद्यादिकं  
कारणमिति ।   
2- When do the ``last moments'' begin?  
Suppose a person plans to go on a long trip, say, to Kasi  and he had  
never been there earlier. One can easily imagine the excitement that  
wells up in his mind. He will start running around, gathering all the  
information about the place. He will start looking for people who can  
provide the information, the train fare and numerous other details.  
All these activities will be occupying his mind constantly as there  
will be some  associated tension also. He  may be physically present  
in his home town but his mind has already gone to the other place. So  
we may say that the journey begins the moment it is conceived of. The  
actual travel is also there and will follow. Similarly our journey  
begins the moment we start thinking of the other world.The pilgrimage  
to Kasi may come through or not: but this journey we are talking  
about has to be undertaken by everyone. The details are plunged in  
mystery. So it is incumbent on everyone to start knowing the complete  
details about the travel and making the preparations. All these are  
to be done now and without delaying it any further.  
It is said that death takes birth along with our birth. BH(10-1-38).  
Vasudeva points this out to Kamsa.  
मृत्युः जन्मवतां वीर देहेन सह जायते । अद्य वा अब्धशतान्ते  
वा मृत्युर्वै प्राणिनां ध्रुवम् ॥   
From that moment it never leaves us even for a moment. Rama says this  
to Bharata when the latter meets him in Chitrakoota. Bharata is  
inconsolable at all the tragic events that had happened in his  
abscence. His father had died leaving his three mothers widowed,  
Ayodhya was plunged in grief and to cap it all his dear brother Rama  
had been expelled from the kingdom. Rama consoles him and points out  
that death is inevitable. There is no use in grieving over the dead  
as every one is inexorably moving towards his own end. So Rama  
advises him to stop crying over the king who is gone and instead to  
grieve for himself.  
अहो रात्राणि गच्छन्ति सर्वेषां प्राणिनामिह । आयूंषि  
क्षपयन्त्याशु ग्रीष्मे जलमिवांशवः ॥   
Passing days and nights quickly end the life-span of all living  
beings in this world, (even) as sunbeams suck up the water in summer.  
आत्मानमनुशोच त्वं किमन्यमनुशोचसि । आयुस्तु हीयते यस्य  
स्थितस्यास्य गतस्य च ॥   
Grieve for yourself (alone), why do you grieve for another? In fact,  
the life-span of each and every creature, whether staying (at home)  
or departed (for another place), gets shortened (every moment).  
सहैव मृत्युर्व्रजति सह मृत्युर्निषीदति । गत्वा  
सुदीर्घमध्वानं सह मृत्युर्निवर्तते ॥   
Death ever walks with us (when we are walking) and remains seated  
with us (while we are sitting). (Nay,) having travelled a very long  
distance (with us) death returns with us (on our return). (Ayodhya  
Kanda -105-20, 21 and 22).  
Thus, one has to be alive to the fact that death is shadowing us.  
Because of this reason there has to be a sense of urgency and every  
moment has to be considered as the last moment. This is where the  
glory of Shrimad Bhagavatham becomes evident. If Ramayana teaches us  
the art of living then Shrimad Bhagavatham becomes an excellent  
treatise on the art of dying. This is because this purana gives in  
detail the answer to the third question:    
3- How shoud one prepare himself for the ``last moments?''  
This is one of the two questions asked by the king ParikShit to the  
sage Suka as the king is left with just a week to live. He asks:    
अतः पृच्छामि संसिद्धिं योगिनां परमं गुरुम् । पुरुषस्येह  
यत् कार्यं म्रियमाणस्य सर्वथा ॥   
``I enquire of you, the greatest preceptor of the Yogis, the  
character and the means of the highest realisation. What should be  
done under all circumstances by a man who is on the verge of  
death?'' BH(1-12-37). The answer to the questions is given in the  
Book II of  Bhagavatam and has been elaborated in the further Books  
also. This is similar to what is said in chapter 8 of Gita.  
We have seen that those who are soaked in samsara and lead a Bohemian  
life get inferior births. Those who perform their duties and rituals  
with desires सकाम कर्मा get births suitable for the fulfilment  
of the desires.  
Those who perform desireless karmas निष्काम कर्मा and also  
upasana (which includes offering prayers, worship of the Lord in any  
particular form etc.) form the next higher category. Krishna advises  
that such people should, at the time of departure, cut off all  
attachments. Then they should concentrate on the Lord in His cosmic  
form as Virat Purusha or Viswarupa Iswara and leave the body. They  
attain liberation in stages called क्रममुक्तिः ।  
प्रयाण काले मनसाऽचलेन भक्त्या युक्तो योगबलेन चैव ।  
भ्रुवोर्मध्ये प्राणमावेश्य सम्यक् स तं परं पुरुषामुपैति दिव्यम् ॥ BG(8-10) .  
But a person of wisdom - jnani- who has realised his true nature does  
not worry about death as it is meaningless to him. He is free and  
liberated - मुक्तः ।  He is totally detached from the body..  
  
The celebrated Tamil saint Pattinaththar presents this matter in his  
own unique rather blunt way. The body by itself is inert only. It is  
the presence of the consciousness in it that keeps it alive. Thus the  
only difference between a living body and the dead one is the  
presence of the animating life in the living body. And sooner or  
later the living body will also become dead or a corpse. So the  
saint, who was the personification of detachment, calls it as the  
``will-soon-be-dead'' corpse! Or to put it in his language  
one is a dead corpse and the other a ``will-soon-be-dead  
corpse'' only. If one accepts this truth then one need not grieve  
over death. This is a well known fact only, but comes as a rude  
revelation. He is amused at the sight of a group of people  
surrounding  a dead body and crying over it. He asks Lord Shiva at the  
famous Kanchipuram temple ``O Lord! whence is this confusion;  
some will-soon-be -dead corpses falling and crying over a  
dead-corpse?'' A pregnant, though a very disturbing one,  
statement that leaves us much to ponder.  
  
4- How much time the preparations will require?  
The ``preparation'' is for escaping death and it is  
meaningful only for one for whom ``death'' has meaning. As  
pointed out earlier ``death'' is irrelevant for a person who  
has gained wisdom. ``One can escape death only by knowing Him.  
There is no other way to escape death.'' So assert the shahtras.  
तमेव विदित्वातिमृत्युमेति नान्यः पन्था विद्यतेऽयनाय ॥   
SU(3-8). Thus the one who has gained wisdom is clear that death can  
destroy only the body and not him. So he has no fear of death.  
Yama-the Lord of death says this to the boy Nachiketa who sought  
wisdom from him:   
अशरीरँ शरीरेषु अनवस्थेष्ववस्थितम् । महान्तं  
विभुमात्मानं मत्वा धीरो न शोचति ॥   
The wise person does not grieve. He knows that the all-pervading, the  
greatest Supreme Self is present without body among all the  
perishable bodies. KU(1-2-22).  
Thus the preparation is relevant only to others who are in various  
stages of spiritual progress. They have to gain wisdom first to be  
able to reject death. This is illustrated by the story of Markandeya.  
He was a devout worshipper of Lord Shiva. He knew death was imminent.  
When the hour of death approached he embraced Shiva (who is the very  
embodiment of knowledge)  implying he got wisdom and with the wisdom  
rejected death and as a result he became immortal.  
  
The question now becomes how long does it take to gain wisdom about  
ourselves. Unfortunately Krishna says it is a very long process and  
may involve many births   
बहूनां जन्मना-मन्ते ज्ञानवान् मां प्रपद्यते । वासुदेवः  
सर्वमिति स महात्मा सुदुर्लभः ॥ BG(7-19).  
At the end of many births, the man of wisdom comes to Me, (realising)  
that Vasudeva is the all: he is the noble-souled, very hard to find.  
Shri Sankaracharya explains in his commentary that these many births  
are required to gain the mental maturity to make him fit enough to  
acquire and assimilate the supreme wisdom that liberates him.  
बहूनां जन्मनां ज्ञानर्थसंस्काराश्रयाणां  
अन्ते समाप्तौ ज्ञानवान् प्राप्तपरिपाकज्ञानः मां वासुदेवं  
प्रत्यगात्मानं प्रत्यक्षतः प्रपद्यते । He then realises the goal  
to be reached is Vasudeva who is the inner self of all. Why such a  
person is extremely rare to find? Krishna had said earlier:    
मनुष्याणां सहस्रेषु कश्चिद्यतति सिद्धये । यततामपि  
सिद्धानां कश्चिन्मां वेत्ति तत्त्वतः ॥ BG(7-3) .  
Just one man among thousands strives to win the knowledge: among  
those who know and strive, only one comes to know Me in truth.  
What is the reason for this unfortunate situation? Why are people not  
interested in the path of knowledge that assures them liberation?  
The reasons can be many. One is that we have tenanted the body in  
innumerable births and have become attached to it. The attachment is  
so great that we have come to take the body to be ourselves. It  
sounds preposterous to hear that we are not the body, but something  
occupying it. It is naturally difficult, almost immpossible to shake  
off the attachment that we have so assiduously nourished over such a  
long time.  
Secondly all the talk about the other world and liberation etc.,  
sounds very theoretical. Things like heaven and God appear nebulous  
and remote. What they are said to offer is not certain. So one tends  
to prefer the bird in the hand and not the promised land.  
We do not come across any who had been there and could narrate their  
experiences. All that we hear about is only culled from various  
books. Thus it is very difficult to get a lively interest in the  
subject.  
Then there are enough discussions on other mundane topics that can  
veer us away from the subject. The influences of the media, the alien  
religions, the many incidents that happen around us and some of our  
own experiences add to the scepticism and help to slacken what little  
interest one might have developed in the subject.  
Then the preparatory steps that one is expected to go through to  
become a qualified student for taking up the study of vedanta can be  
daunting. They too can put off one from taking serious interest in  
the subject. Because the steps known as साधन  
चतुष्टयसंपत्तिः or the four fold qualifications include  
things such as control of the mind to curb its wandering tendencies  
so that it becomes focussed on a subject, control of the sense organs  
so that they become disciplined, detachment to the pleasures of the  
world.  
Thus the reasons why people are not interested in the topic of  
liberation can be many. One is busy during the active part of the  
life. The general tendency is to put off religion  for the post  
retirement period. But then it may be too late! Old age will bring  
with it its own problems. So Shri Sankaracharya wails:   
बालस्तावत् क्रीडासक्तः तरुणस्तावत् तरुणीसक्तः ।  
वृद्धस्तावच्चिन्तासक्तः परेब्रह्मणि कोऽपि न सक्तः ॥   
So our scriptures advise one to start the practices early in life  
before one gets sucked into the whirlpool of life. Prahlada tenders  
this considered advice to his friends: कौमार आचरेत्प्राज्ञो  
धर्मान् भागवतानिह । BH(7-6-1). When young the mind is fresh,  
receptive to advices and is not yet polluted by the pulls and pushes  
of the world. Kalidasa mentions that the kings of the solar dynasty,  
about whom he writes in his great work Raghuvamsam, acquainted with  
this subject even when young. He says शैशवेऽभ्यस्तविद्यानां   
(1-7). Our tradition says that only that learning that leads to  
liberation can be called education.  
सा विद्या या विमुक्तये । Shri Sankaracharya also defines education  
as आत्मनो बोधः while commenting on the popular verse beginning  
विद्या विनयसंपन्ने ब्राह्मणे गवि हस्तिनि ।  BG(5-18). It is  
knowing about Self. Thus Devi (LakShmi, Lalita) is called Vidya  
विद्या । The commentator's explanation is:    
मोक्षप्रदज्ञानस्वरूपत्वाद्विद्या । (Lalita Sahasranamam. No 549).  
Other subjects are learnt only to eke out a living. They will not be  
useful beyond a point of time. Thus they are inferior. So a wise  
person will not fail to give utmost importance to this subject.This  
is said in our upanishads   
द्वे विद्ये वेदितव्ये इति ह स्म यद्ब्रह्मविदो वदन्ति परा चैवापरा  
च । तत्रापरा ऋग्वेदो यजुर्वेदः सामवेदोऽथर्ववेदः शिक्षा  
कल्पो व्याकरणं निरुक्तं छन्दो ज्योतिषमिति । अथ परा यया  
तदक्षरमधिगम्यते ॥ MU(1-4 and 5).  
These mantras say that there are two Vidyas worth knowing to men -  
Para and Apara. Out of these two; the vedas, and all their branches  
through which one can gain the worldly and otherworldly enjoyments is  
the inferior one and is called Apara Vidya. Para or the superior one  
is that through which the imperishable brahman is known.  
Yama also tells this to his student Nachiketa:   
श्रेयश्च प्रेयश्च मनुष्यमेतस्तौ संपरीत्य विविनक्ति  
धीरः । KU(1-2-2). He says that two paths present themselves before  
every one. One is called sreyas  i.e., the one that offers release  
from all miseries for ever and the other is called preyas i.e., the  
means of obtaining the pleasures of this world. The wise person  
prefers the former viz., sreyas in comparison to preyas.  
The Tamil saint Tiruvalluvar also points this out in his great work  
Tirukkural. He asks what profit have those derived from learning if  
it  does not lead to the worship of the Lord who is possessed of pure  
knowledge?  
But generally all these warnings and advices fall on deaf ears.  
Consequently we have to take the long path for salvation. The story  
of Gajendra, the elephant narrated in the eighth book of Bhagavata  
illustrates this point. The elephant symbolises one covered with  
ignorance. The elephant has a large family comprising of she  
elephants and baby elephants - a typical samsari. He was  
``enjoying'' the life. He was afflicted with the heat and  
entered a lake full offragrant waters. The fragrant waters  
represent the vAsanAs or the latent tendencies accumulated in  
previous births. He enjoyed a refreshing bath, sprayed the cool  
waters on the female elephants as well as their young ones and made  
them also drink. This he did out of attachment to his own herd. Shri  
Suka adds - like a householder यथागृही । Such a one steeped in  
samsara normally does not imagine there can be trouble around the  
corner. Thus the elephant could not foresee the imminent problem -  
नाचष्ट कृच्छ्रं कृपणोऽजमायया । . A crocodile -  
representing kala - caught hold of the elephant. The elephant  
struggled hard to free himself but did not succeed. The gods looked  
on the struggle without coming forward to help. The struggle went on  
for thousands of years. This long time represents the numerous births  
one wrapped in ignorance has to take. The elephant found that his  
family members left him one by one . He was left alone, drained  of  
energy and helpless. At this point the distraught animal cried to the  
Lord for help. Indra, Brahma and similar gods did not respond as they  
too are in the grip of time. The appearance of the Lord shows the  
dawn of wisdom. He killed the crocodile  and released the elephant  
meaning that with the gaining of wisdom one is released from samsara  
or the cycle of birth and death.  
  
Shri Suka gives another example of the king Khatwanga of the solar  
dynasty. He was very powerful and on several occassions  had helped  
the gods in their fights against the asuras. Once, after such a fight  
the devas wanted to offer a favour in return for the help they have  
received from the king. The only favour the king wanted was to know  
the duration of life remaining. Much against their will the devas had  
to inform him that he had only about an hour to left to live. The  
king at once rushed back to earth, renounced every thing, meditated  
on the Lord in that brief period of time and got liberation   
खड्वाङ्गो नाम राजर्षिः ज्ञात्वेयत्तामिहायुषाः । मुहूर्तात्  
सर्वमुत्सृज्य गतवानभ्यं हरिम् ॥ BH(2-1-13). Most  
appropriately Shri Suka calls the king राजर्षिः or royal sage, a  
saint like king.  
How can this be possible when Krishna had said that one can get  
liberated only after repeated births? The answer lies in the fact  
that  
one has to take several births before coming to the path of devotion:    
but having stepped into the right path he will get births suitable  
for his spiritual progress   
तत्र तं बुद्धि-संयोगं लभते पौर्वदेहिकम् । यतते च ततो  
भूयः संसिद्धौ कुरुनन्दन ॥ BG(6-43).  
Krishna says that in his new birth he gains touch with the knowledge  
that was acquired in the former body. He strives with greater vigour  
than that with which he strove before for perfection. Thus the  
progress continues and does not stop till one gains wisdom mentioned  
in our shastras. At that stage one's preparations are over. Thus the  
king too was making progress. He got birth in the right  
environment i.e., the solar dynasty. He got the right education even  
as a child just like Kalidasa said of the kings of the solar dynasty  
शैशवेऽभ्यस्तविद्यानाम् । The story of Khatwanga is told in  
book nine of Bhagavatha. The king, on being informed of the short  
span of life left did not panic or get agitated: but was smart enough  
to take appropriate steps without delay.  He said that even as a  
child he knew what was reality and was not attached to sense  
pleasures offered by his vast kingdom. Thus, thanks to the right  
education he had received in his early days he had wisdom. He could  
renounce his kingdom etc., without hesitation and sit in meditation.  
These characteristics were also  typical of the kings of solar  
dynasty i.e., यथाकालप्रबोधिनां they were alert at all times  
when vigilance was called for and then at the end (of their lives)  
they abandoned their bodies by means of meditation   
योगेनान्ते तनुत्यजाम् . This is mentioned by Kalidasa in his  
Raghuvamsam.  
No wonder, then the king got the result he wanted in a short time.  
Shri Suka gives the example of a great monarch to king ParikShit: not  
that of an ordinary person or a sanyasi so that ParikShit will get  
confidence that even a king like himself who had lived in the lap of  
luxury could work and get liberated in a short time. But in his case  
ParikShit had one full week to get freedom. So Shri Suka advises him  
to shed fear first as there was ample time.  
Then it was said that the one who reads the stotram with devotion  
will feel secure as he will be protected by the Lord on the way.  
मार्गमध्येऽभयंच आशुतोषो महेशः ।   
It was stated earlier that our journey has already started and so we  
are on the way. The question, now, is how can reading the stotram with  
devotion confer security on the way? This becomes more relevant as  
the upanishads say आनन्दं ब्रह्मणो विद्वान् । न बिभेति  
कदाचनेति । the person having experienced the bliss of brahman  
ever fears not. (TU-II-4-1) that only by realising the Self one can  
shed his fears. We are long way from realising brahman. We very much  
seek security.We have the constant fear that the things that we  
consider as contributing to our security may get damaged or destroyed  
or leave us. Thus we worry about sickness, loss of money, friends or  
relatives etc.. The remedy for this feeling of insecurity is to  
realise that all these listed above can not last for  ever. Either  
they will leave us or we will have to leave them some day. Everyone  
knows this but wants them to last for ever. Thus we want the body to  
be youthful and last for ever. One is unwilling to grow old and end  
one's days. Being insecure themselves nothing on the earth can confer  
security.This is a fact and has to be accepted howsoever bitter this  
may be. But strangely no one is prepared to accept this. Acceptance  
requires wisdom and it is not got in a day. It is a difficult  
process. The recital of the stotrams and other texts like the puranas  
pave the way for gaining the knowledge. They describe the endearing  
qualities of the Lord in a manner that will make our heart turn to  
Him. Once He gains entry into our heart He clears the accumulated  
sins and brings in the wisdom. Krishna has given this assurance in  
Gita (10-10)  
तेषां सतत-युक्तानां भजतां प्रीति-पूर्वकम् । ददामि  
बुद्धि-योगं तं येन मामुपयान्ति ते ॥   
``To these, ever devout, worshipping Me with love, I give that  
devotion of knowledge by which they come to Me.'' Thus devotion  
develops where even the seed of  it was absent earlier. This is the  
power of listening to His glories   
यस्यां वै श्रूयमाणायां कृष्णे परमपूरुषे । भक्तिरुत्पद्यते  
पुंसः शोकमोहभयापहा ॥ BH(1-7-7). Such devotion dispels  
grief, infatuation and fear. Shri Suka lays stress on the fact that  
this happens even one decides to listen to the Lord's stories  
(श्रूयमाणायाम् ) leaving us to imagine what benefits it can confer  
when one actually takes to listening to them.  
Shri Vedanta Desika states this clearly in his poem Abhitistavam (5).  
He says:   
भवन्तमिह यः स्वधीनियतचेतनाचेतनं  
पनायति नमस्यति स्मरति वक्ति पर्येति वा ।  
गुणं कमपि वेत्ति वा तव गुणेश गोपायितुः  
कदाचन कुतश्चन क्वचन तस्य न स्याद्भयम् ॥   
He says that one who praises the Lord or salutes Him or remembers Him  
or recites hymns about Him or circumambulates Him or knows about at  
least one of His attributes does not encounter fear of any kind at  
any time from anyone at any place. This is repeatedly stated towards  
the end of Vishnu Sahasranama stotram in the फलश्रुतिः . It is  
said न भयं क्वचिदाप्नोति वीर्यं तेजश्च विन्दति and  
भयान्मुच्येत भीतस्तु मुच्येतापन्न आपदः । and  
जन्ममृत्युजराव्याधिभयं नैवोपजायते । .  
This was what happened to the king ParikShit when he listened to Shri  
Bhagavatham. The experience totally transformed him. He shed the fear  
of death, gained wisdom and got release.  
God grants us the wisdom that removes the fear. So he is called  
भयापहः - भयं संसारजं पुंसामपघ्नन् भयापहः ।   
VS(935). But there may be fear from foes and elements etc. God  
removes them also. Shiva is known as सहायः -  
ब्रह्मादीनामप्यापत्काले रक्षक इत्यर्थाः । SS(762). He protects  
even gods like Brahma in times of danger. Lalita is called  
भयापहा - भयानि जलस्थलादिप्रयुक्तादीनि सर्वाण्यपहन्तीति  
भयापहा । ᳚आनन्दं ब्रह्मणो विद्वान्न बिभेति  
कुतश्चनेति᳚ श्रुतेः । तथा च वायुपुराणे ᳚अरण्ये  
प्रान्तरे वापि जले वापि स्थलेऽपि वा । व्याघ्रकुम्भीरचोरेभ्यो  
भयस्थाने विशेषतः । आधिष्वपि च सर्वेषु देवीनामानि  
कीर्तये᳚दिति ।   
We do not realise the fact that He is never away from us even for a  
moment. We are used to looking out for security and not within. The  
devout Pandavas knew that they could get His help readily whenever it  
was needed. Kunti, the mother of Pandavas, acknowledged this fact  
gratefully. She said:   
विषान्महाग्नेः पुरुषाददर्सादसत्सभाया वनवासकृच्छ्रतः ।  
मृधे मृधेऽनेकमहारथास्त्रतो द्रौण्यस्त्रतश्चास्म  
हरेऽभिरक्षिताः ॥ BH(1-8-24). She said that Krishna protected them  
from poison, from a conflagration, from the look of man-eating  
demons, from the assembly of evil people (Duryodhana and his  
associates), from the many perils met during their stay in the  
forest, from the missiles of many great warriors (like Bhishma, Drona  
etc..) in every battle and lastly from the missile discharged by  
Aswatthama (the son of Dronacharya).  
The gopis also stated that Krishna saved them time and again from  
death from poisonous water, demons in various disguises, showers,  
storm and lightning and other perils   
विषजलाप्ययाद् व्यालराक्षसाद् वर्षमारुताद् वैद्युतानलात् ।  
वृषमयात्मजाद् विश्वतोभयादृषभ ते वयं रक्षिता  
मुहुः ॥ BH(10-31-3).  
Thus the truly devout people never miss Him and are , therefore do  
not feel insecure on the way. The ``way'' or मार्गः may  
be viewed allegorically also. Our scriptures talk of many ways to  
worship Him. These are meant for people with differing tastes based  
on their temperaments. The Shiva-Mahimna Stotram says this:   
त्रयी सांख्यं योगः पशुपतिमतं वैष्णवमिति  
प्रभिन्ने प्रस्थाने परमिदमदः पथ्यमिति च ।  
रुचीनां वैचित्र्यादृजु-कुटिल-नानापथजुषां  
नृणामेको गम्यस्त्वमसि पयसामर्णवमिव ॥ (7).  
There are different paths (of realisation) as enjoined by the three  
vedas, Samkhya, Yoga, Pasupatha doctrine and Vaishnava shastras.  
People follow different paths and each considers some particular path  
to be the proper one. This is because of the difference in their  
temperaments. But ultimately they all reach You only just as the  
rivers enter the ocean.  
Krishna says that all paths of worship lead to Him only and It is He  
who rewards them, just in the way they seek Him   
ये यथा मां प्रपद्यन्ते तांस्तथैव भजाम्यहम् । मम  
वर्त्मानुवर्तन्ते मनुष्याः पार्थस्सर्वशः ॥ BG(4-11).  
Shri Rudram salutes  Lord Shiva who is in the form of various paths. It  
says - पथीनां पतये नमः । पथीनां = शास्त्रोक्त  
दक्षिणोत्तर- तृतीय-मार्गाणां पतिः । This says that Rudra is  
the protector of the three paths described in the sastras. Later It  
again says: नमः स्रुत्याय च पथ्याय च । salutation to Him  
who is in the narrow foot paths and in the broad highways स्रुतिः  
स्वल्पो देवलोकमार्गः, पन्था ब्रह्मलोकमार्गः । The narrow path  
indicates tortuous religious beliefs and practices. Krishna talks  
about this   
मूढग्राहेणात्मनो यत्पीड्य क्रियते तपः । परस्योत्सादनार्तं वा  
तत्तामसमुदाहृतम् ॥ BG(17-19).  
The penance which is performed obstinately, with self-torture, or for  
the purpose of ruining another is declared to be Tamasic. The broad  
and firm ways represent the beliefs and practices inculcated by the  
great teachers. They are the safe ways and are intended to be trodden  
by the common people महाजनानां येनगतः स पन्थाः says  
Mahabharatha. Saint Thiagaraja talks about this in his famous song  
``Sakkani raja margamu undaga.'' He asks ``when there is  
the well-laid king's highway of devotion to God, why do foolish  
people stray into hard, tortuous and thorny footpaths and  
suffer?'' Saint Manickavachagar has stated the same idea in his  
Tiruvachagam. He says ``I was straying in the company of fools  
who did not know the path to liberation. The Lord pointed out to me  
the path of devotion and how to shake myself free from my past acts.  
He flushed out the impurities in my mind. He made me Shivam or the  
auspicious one and ruled me with grace. Oh! who had received in full  
measure the bounty God has showered on me? I mistook the wrong paths  
to be the right ones. He prevented me from following the small  
pathways and showed me the broad ones for obtaining His divine  
grace.''  
Again Shri Rudra says नम इरिण्याय च प्रपथ्याय च ।   
Salutation to Him who abides in saline tracts and in trodden  
pathways.  
इरिण्याय   Irinyaya: signifies arid  tracts and has a refernce to  
samsara.  
प्रपथ्यः   बहुभिहि सेवितो मार्गः प्रपथः, तत्र भवः  
प्रपथ्यः । ᳚नम इरिण्याय चप्रपथ्याय चे᳚ति  
श्रुतिः   
SS(346). Prapathyaya: pathway trodden or resorted to by many.  
The Lord helps all who seek Him by following various paths. He  
says:   
मच्चितः सर्वदुर्गाणि मत्प्रसादात्तरिष्यसि । Fix your heart in  
Me. You shall, by My grace, cross over all difficulties.  
So let us latch on to Him and win His grace.  
Thus we have come to the end of this gem of a poem. Quotations from  
various sources have been given to stress the point that the Lord is  
one but known by various names and forms. We can find that though  
this is a small piece of work it condenses in itself the gist of  
vedantic truth and is very suitable for regular recitation. I submit  
this commentary of mine at the feet of my preceptor Shri Vedanta  
Desikachariar Swami. He litererally flodded me with ideas on this  
poem But my bird brain could retain only an iota of what he  
communicated to me. I trust this work will receive the approval of  
the readers. Namaste. Om Tat Sat.
