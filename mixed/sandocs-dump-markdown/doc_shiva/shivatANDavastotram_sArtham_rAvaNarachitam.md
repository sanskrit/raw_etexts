      सम्पूर्णम्  
       ends.   
  
 Thus ends the Shiva-Tandava Stotra written by Ravana.  
  
The word-meanings and translation have been kindly provided by  
Dr. Sarasvati Mohan and her students at Samskrit  
Academy, San Jose CA, USA. She teaches samskrit in the Bay area.  
The typing of these was done by SArada kALiSeTTy  
  
The stotra is in panchachAmara Chanda, in which there are 16  
varna-s per line, each line begins with a laghu and the laghu and guru varna-s  
alternate. So there are eight LG (laghu-guru) pairs, making up 16 syllables of  
each line.  The last shloka is in Vasanta-tilakA metre.  
  
Some versions of the stotra carry 17-19 verses.  For total 17 version,  
there are two as follows that devotee can add during prayers.  
निलिम्पनाथनागरीकदम्बमौलमल्लिका-  
     निगुम्फनिर्भरक्षरन्मधूष्णिकामनोहरः ।  
तनोतु नो मनोमुदं विनोदिनीमहर्निशं  
     परश्रियः परं पदन्तदङ्गजत्विषां चयः ॥ १४॥   
  
Divine beauty of different parts of Lord Shiva which are  
enlightened by fragrance of the flowers decorating the twisted  
hair locks of angels may always bless us with happiness and  
pleasure.

विमुक्तवामलोचनाविवाहकालिकध्वनिः  
     शिवेति मन्त्रभूषणा जगज्जयाय जायताम् ॥ १५॥   
The Shakti (energy) which is capable of burning all the sins  
and spreading welfare of all and the pleasant sound produced  
by angels during enchanting the pious Shiv mantra at the time  
of Shiv-Parvati Vivah may win over and destroy all the sufferings  
of the world.  
  
There are two additional verses seen in some version   
नमामि पार्वतीपतिं नमामि जाह्नवीपतिं  
     नमामि भक्तवत्सलं नमामि फाललोचनम् ।  
नमामि चन्द्रशेखरं नमामि दुःखमोचनं  
     तदीयपादपङ्कजं स्मराम्यहं नटेश्वरम् ॥ १६॥  
Salutations to consort of Parvati,  
Salutations to lord of Ganga,  
Salutations to the one who is kind to worshippers,  
Salutations to the one having an eye in the forehead,  
Salutations to the one adorned with Moon crescent as a crown,  
Salutations to the one who liberates from sorrow  
I meditate upon his lotus like feet, Salutations to the dancing Shiva.  
  
and the last (19) in conclusion   
रावणेन कृतं स्तोत्रं यः पठेच्छिवसन्निधौ ।  
पुत्रपौत्रादिकं सौख्यं लभते मोक्षमेव च ॥  
  
   इति दशकन्धरविरचितं शिवताण्डवस्तोत्रं समाप्तम् ।  
  
The one who recites the praise composed by Ravana, fully  
associated near Shiva, receives happiness generated by  
children and grandchildren (and other desirable things) and  
also attains salvation.
