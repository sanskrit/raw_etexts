The logic of materialist science fails when  
observers are considered . How can inanimate matter, governed by  
fixed laws, lead to mind?  
To bring in consciousness as a separate category like  
space, time, matter, as suggested by  
many physicists and neuroscientists,  
leads to further paradox.  
This very issue was considered with great subtlety in the Vedic tradition  
of India . Here we consider one of the late classics  
of this tradition that deals with the question of  
consciousness, laws, and freedom---the justly famous  
Siva Sutras (c . 800 C.E.).  
We present a new translation of the Siva Sutras along  
with a commentary.  
  
रूपंरूपं प्रतिरूपो बभूव  
तदस्य रूपं प्रतिचक्षणाय ।  
  
He became the original form of every form  
It is his form that is everywhere to be seen.  
-Rigveda 6-47-18  
*Introduction  
Our knowledge of the physical world is based on empirical associations.  
These associations reveal the laws of the physical world.  
But how do we study the nature of consciousness?  
There is no way to observe one's own awareness because  
we are aware through the associations with the phenomenal world.  
The Vedas deal precisely with this central question of the nature  
of knowledge.  
The consciousness aspect of the Vedas was emphasized most  
emphatically by Dayananda (1824-1883) and Aurobindo (1872-1950).  
It is seen with directness in the Upanishads.  
For an overview of the Vedic tradition see the recent book coauthored  
by me (Feuerstein et al, 1995); this book summarizes new insights  
from archaeology and history of science.  
It has been less than a century that  
the theories of relativity and quantum physics have brought the observer  
centerstage in physics.  
It is not surprising, therefore, that the  Vedic ideas,  
with their emphasis on cognition, have been a source  
of enduring inspiration in modern science.  
As is well known, the idea of brahman in the Vedas being a representation  
of all possibilities, as in the statement  praj~nanam brahman,  
was the inspiration in the conception of the wavefunction of quantum  
theory defined as a sum of all possibilites (Moore, 1989; Kak, 1995b).  
Modern science has had great success in explaining the nature of  
the physical world.  
But these successes have not brought us any closer to the resolution  
of the mystery of consciousness.  
In the application of quantum theory to the macroworld and in  
the neuropsychological explorations of the brain, one cannot any  
longer ignore  
the question of the observer (e.g . Kak, 1995a, 1995b, 1996a, 1996b, 1996c).  
The notion that the mind emerges somehow out of the complexity  
of the connections inside the brain is too simplistic to be taken  
seriously.  
It is like Baron MnChausen pulling himself out of the  
bog by his own bootstraps!  
If mind emerges from matter, how does it obtain autonomy?  
If the world is governed by laws then how do we have free will?  
If our autonomy (free will) is an epiphenomenon then are we  
walking shadows?  
Should one consider consciousness to be the ground-stuff of reality?  
If that is so then what is the connection between consciousness and  
the physical world?  
These are just the questions that we come across repeatedly in  
the Indian tradition . Is there something to be learnt from  
the insights of this tradition?  
The  Aphorisms of Shiva (Siva Sutras) (SS) are a late  
reiteration of the Vedic view of consciousness.  
According to legend, Vasugupta (c . 800 C.E . in Kashmir) `saw' the aphorisms  
(sutras) in his dream.  
Siva Sutras led to the flowering of the Kashmir school  
of consciousness (Kashmir Shaivism).  
It is due to a very clear exposition of the issues the Kashmir  
Shaivism has come to be quite influential in contemporary  
scholarship.  
In this paper we present a translation, along with the Sanskrit  
text, of the 78 aphorisms of the SS.  
(The 78 number itself has a very important significance in the  
Vedic systof knowledge may  
be seen elsewhere (e.g . Kak 1994, 1995c)).  
The commentary provided in this paper is not based on the  
commentatorial tradition from within Kashmir Shaivism  
(see e.g . Jaideva Singh, 1979; Dyczkowski, 1992) so as not to  
burden the reader with the unfamiliar vocabulary of the tradition.  
I present my translation, as well as my commentary, in as modern  
terms as possible.  
*The universal and the individual in the SS  
According to SS the individual knowledge comes from associations.  
Owing to this our phenomenal knowledge can only be in terms of  
the associations of the outer world.  
But the associations in themselves need something to bind them  
together.This is the binding problof neuroscience to which no  
solution, within the standard scientific paradigm, is known  
(see Kak 1995a for details).  
The binding energy is  called matrika (matrikA).  
It is matrika that makes it possible for us to understand words  
or symbols strung together as  
language.  
Lacking matrika, computers cannot understand language or pictures.  
Universal consciousness, as a unity, is called Shiva or Bhairava.  
Shiva makes it possible for the material associations of the  
phycisal world to have meaning.  
But the domain of the union of Shiva and the phenomenal world is  
puzzling and astonishing (1-12).  
This is a restatement of a metaphor that goes back to the  
Rigveda where the mind is seen  
as two birds are sitting on a tree where one of theats the  
sweet fruit and the other looks on without eating (RV 1-164-20);  
one of the birds represents the universal consciousness, the  
other the individual one.  
There is only one bird; the other is just the image of the first  
energized by the fruit!  
There is a paradox here which is left unresolved.  
But certainly root consciousness (Shiva, prakasa, cit)  
is what makes it possible  
to comprehend.  
In later texts the capacity of consciousness to reflect on  
itself is called  vimarsa.  
Another metaphor that has been used elsewhere is that of the sun  
of consciousness illuminating the associations in the mind.  
What facilitates this illumination is the ``power of the will.''  
Innate knowledge is taken to emerge from the mind, which is equated  
with mantra, taken here to not as a formula but the inherent capacity  
to reflect.  
Mantra leads to the knowledge of the reality that lies beyond  
material associations.  
Consider sound made meaningful in terms of  
strings that, as words, have specific associations.  
But what about the `meaning' of elementary sounds?  
This happens as one opens the `crack' between the universal  
and the individual.  
The individual then gets transformed into a state where  
knowledge is his food.  
The detachment from one's own associations is the key to  
the knowledge of the self---the universal being.  
One is supposed to take oneself as an outsider.  
By separating the senses from the source of consciousness,  
one is able to reach to the heart of the self.  
*The Siva Sutras  
Ths chapter presents my new  
English translation . For earlier translations see  
Jaideva Singh (1979) and Dyczkowski (1992). Note that Jaideva Singh  
has 77 sutras whereas Dyczkowski has 79; for the reason why the  
canonical text is likely to have had 78 sutras see Kak (1994).  
*1- Universal consciousness  
1-1 Consciousness is the self.  
1-2 (Ordinary) knowledge consists of associations.  
1-3 Sets of axioms generate structures.  
1-4 The ground of knowledge is matrika.  
1-5 The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava.  
1-6 By union with the energy centers one withdraws from the universe.  
1-7 Even during waking, sleep, and deep sleep one can experience  
the fourth state (transcending consciousness).  
1-8 (Sensory) knowledge is obtained in the waking state.  
1-9 Dreaming is free ranging of thoughts.  
1-10 Deep sleep is maya, the irrational.  
1-11 The experiencer of the three states is the lord of the senses.  
1-12 The domain of the union is an astonishment.  
1-13 The power of the will is the playful uma.  
1-14 The observed has a structure.  
1-15 By fixing the mind on its core one can comprehend  
perceivable and emptiness.  
1-16 Or by contemplating the pure principle one is free of  
the power that binds (to associations).  
1-17 Right discernment is the knowledge of the self.  
1-18 The bliss of the sight is the joy of samadhi.  
1-19 The body emerges when the energies unite.  
1-20 Elements unite, elements separate, and the universe is gathered.  
1-21 Pure knowledge leads to a mastery of the wheel (of energies).  
1-22 The great lake (of space-time) is experienced through the  
power of mantra.  
*2- The emergence of innate knowledge  
2-1 The mind is mantra.  
2-2 Effort leads to attainment.  
2-3 The secret of mantra is the being of the body of knowledge.  
2-4 The emergence of the mind in the womb is the forgetting of  
common knowledge.  
2-5 When the knowledge of one's self arises one moves in the  
sky of consciousness---the Shiva's state.  
2-6 The guru is the means.  
2-7 The awakening of the wheel of matrikA (the elemental  
energies).  
2-8 The body is the oblation.  
2-9 The food is knowledge.  
2-10 With the extinction of knowledge emerges the vision of  
emptiness.  
*3- The transformations of the individual  
3-1 The mind is the self.  
3-2 (Material) knowledge is bondage (association).  
3-3 Maya is the lack of discernment of the principles  
of transformation.  
3-4 The transformation is stopped in the body.  
3-5 The quieting of the vital channels, the mastery of the  
elements, the withdrawal from the elements, and the separation of  
the elements.  
3-6 Perfection is through the veil of delusion.  
3-7 Overcoming delusion and by boundless extension innate  
knowledge is achieved.  
3-8 Waking is the second ray (of consciousness).  
3-9 The self is the actor.  
3-10 The inner self is the stage.  
3-11 The senses are the spectators.  
3-12 The pure state is achieved by the power of the intellect.  
3-13 Freedom (creativity) is achieved.  
3-14 As here so elsewhere.  
3-15 Emission (of consciousness) is the way of nature and so  
what is not external is seen as external.  
3-16 Attention to the seed.  
3-17 Seated one sinks effortlessly into the lake (of consciousness).  
3-18 The measure of consciousness fashions the world.  
3-19 As (limited) knowledge is transcended, birth is transcended.  
3-20 Maheshvari and other mothers (sources) of beings  
reside in the sound elements.  
3-21 The fourth (state of consciousness) should be used to  
oil the (other) three (states of consciousness).  
3-22 Absorbed (in his nature), one must penetrate (the phonemes)  
with one's mind.  
3-23 The lower plane arises in the center (of the phoneme).  
3-24 A balanced breathing leads to a balanced vision.  
3-25 What was destroyed rises again by the joining of perceptions  
with the objects of experience.  
3-26 He becomes like Shiva.  
3-27 The activity of the body is the vow.  
3-28 The recitation of the mantras is the discourse.  
3-29 Self-knowledge is the boon.  
3-30 He who is established is the means and knowledge.  
3-31 The universe is teh aggregate of his powers.  
3-32 Persistence and absorption.  
3-33 Even when this (maintenance and dissolution) there is no  
break (in awareness) due to the perceiving subjectivity.  
3-34 The feeling of pleasure and pain is external.  
3-35 The one who is free of that is alone (with consciousness).  
3-36 A mass of delusion the mind is subject to activity.  
3-37 When separateness is gone, action can lead to creation.  
3-38 The power to create is based on one's own experience.  
3-39 That which precedes the three (states of consciousness)  
vitalizes them.  
3-40 The same stability of mind (should permeate) the body,  
senses and external world.  
3-41 Craving leads to the extroversion of the inner process.  
3-42 When established in pure awareness, (the craving) is  
destroyed and the (empirical) individual ceases to exist.  
3-43 Although cloaked in the elements one is not free, but,  
like the lord, one is supreme.  
3-44 The link with the vital breath is natural.  
3-45 Concentrating on the center within the nose, what use  
are the left and the right channels or suShumna?  
3-46 May (the individual) merge (in the lord) once again.

*Concluding Remarks  
This brief paper is just an introduction for the  
cognitive scientist to the riches of the  
Kashmir school of consciousness.  
The contents of SS are very cryptic and one may not be  
convinced that it represents any advance over the ancient  
Upanishadic tradition.  
But later texts speak of important details in the process  
of cognition.  
The structure of the Kashmir school  
of consciousness goes beyond the categories of Sa.nkhya.  
I hope that others will examine other classics in this  
tradition (e.g . Abhinavagupta, 1987, 1989; Dyczkowski, 1987) and see for  
themselves whether it has any lessons for  
contemporary science;  
further connections between modern science and this tradition are  
presented in Kak (1992/4).  
The Sanskritists who have worked on Indian theories of consciousness  
have been ignorant of the important insights of modern physics  
relating to the process of observation.  
The argument that one need not know contemporary insights since  
they were unknown when the old texts were written is just plain  
wrong.  
Schrodinger's use of Vedic insights is testimony to the fact  
that the metaphors in use by the ancient thinkers were holistic  
and similar to that of modern physics.  
But do we need to go beyond even this?  
Could the process of meditation on the nature of consciousness  
have led to insights that remain beyond the pale of our  
current understanding of the nature of reality?  
Kashmir Shaivism deals with concepts that also have a bearing on  
questions such as: How do the senses emerge in the emergence of  
the mind?  
Could there be more senses than we possess?  
The whole mythology of Shiva (e.g . Kramrisch, 1981) is a retelling  
of the astonishing insights of the science of consciousness.
