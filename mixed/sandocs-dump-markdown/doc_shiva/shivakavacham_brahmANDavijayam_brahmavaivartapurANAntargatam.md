The above hymn belongs to the genre of poems known as kavacham. A kavacham  
is an armour worn by soldiers in the battlefield as a shield to protect  
them from enemies' weapons. In this hymn the devotee prays to Lord  
Rudra to protect his limbs and from danger from all directions. There  
 are kavachams on many deities. This hymn is a rare amulet (kavacham)  
of Lord Shiva. It is in Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Ganapathy Khanda,  
chapter 35. The kavacha was given to Sage Naradha at his request by Lord  
Narayana. The hymn appears as part of the narration of Parasurama's  
penance on Lord Shiva seeking boons to fulfill his vow to destroy  
twenty one generations of kshatriyas. Pleased with his penance Lord  
Shiva bestowed on him several astras, shastras, rare mantras, stotras  
and kavachams such as Krishna Kavacham, Padma Kavacham, Durga Kavacham,  
Kalika Kavacham, theabove shiva Kavacham etc. The kavacham was originally  
given to Matsya Raja by the Sage Durvasa after bestowing the shadaxara  
mantra. It is in the Kanva Shakha of Vedas. It is a most secretive one and  
difficult to attain. Lord Narayana describes the benefits of chanting  
the kavacham with devotion. Reciting this destroys sins and wards off  
death.One attains (siddhi) fulfillment, attainment of this kavacham  
 by chanting it one million times and becomes verily like Lord Rudra  
Himself. Without knowing this Kavacham a person will not attain siddhi  
of Shiv mantra even if he repeats it ten million times. Performing one  
million asvamedha sacrifices, hundred Rajasuya sacrifices and all other  
sacrifices cannot become equal to one sixteenth of this Kavacham. The  
person who chants this Kavacham becomes a Jivanmukta (liberated even  
while living) and all knowing and attains supernatural powers. The  
armours were used in olden days by solders during wars to protect the  
user from enemies' weapons. In spite of their use solders have been  
injured seriously or even lost their lives. People resort to using  
various devices for their protection. The state employs a vast police  
force and military to provide protection to people. In addition some  
engage security guards for their protection. Ministers, governors and  
high ranking officials get special security guards to protect them  
round the clock. If we ask why all want protection it is to protect  
themselves from pain and death. Still we see that they get attacked  
and killed. Everyone values his life above all else. नह्यात्मनः  
प्रियतरं किञ्चिदस्तीह निश्चितम्  says Mahabharata. We hear  
that asuras did severe penanace and sought freedom from death, only to  
be told that such a boon cannot be granted. One born is destined to  
die. Also the time of death cannot be foretold. Knowing all this no  
one wants to die. This is a strange phenonenon. In Mahabharata there  
is the episode in which King Yudishtira is confronted by a Yaksha who  
puts questions to Yudishtira. One of the questions is what is the  
great wonder.  
किमाश्चर्यम्? The king replies:  
      अहन्यहनि भूतानि गच्छन्तीह यमालयम् ।  
      शेषाः स्थावारमिच्छन्ति किमाश्चर्यमतः परम् ॥   
  
But what happens in reality. Everyone still has fear. The fear arises from  
various sources. The source may be sickness, accidents or death from  
different causes. But still inspite of all the efforts, and ingenious  
devices like insurance schemmes etc., there is still much uncertainty  
about the efficacy of these items. Because the protection offered from  
these devices all suffer from various deficiencies. So, they cannot  
afford total security. One reason is they themselves are not secure  
totally. Even gods like Indra live in fear. We learn from puranas that  
the gods were routed and driven away from their homes by asuras like  
Ravana and Mahabali. Further the positions like Indra and Brahma the  
creator are obtained by merit (punyam). One enjoys the rich life there  
and as soon as the stock of punyam is exhausted the person has to return  
to this world and take another birth. Krishna says this in Gita (9-21).  
ते तं भुक्त्वा स्वर्गलोकं विशालं क्षीणे पुण्ये मर्त्यलोकं विशन्ति  
Thus these lives in higher worlds are also subject to happiness and  
grief. Krishna said this to His friend Uddhava (Bhagavatam 11-6-29,30).  
      कर्माणि दुःखोदर्काणि कुर्वन्देहेन तैहि पुनः ।  
      देहमाभजते तत्र किं सुखं मर्त्यधर्मिणः ॥ (29)  
      लोकानां लोकपालानां मद्भयं कल्पजीविनाम् ।  
      ब्रह्मणोऽपि भयं मत्तः द्विपरार्धपरायुषः ॥ (30).  
Meaning:- Doing throug those bodies deeds that but result in grief,  
they again get new bodies. What happiness comes to mortals  
in this process? The higher worlds as also the rulers of those worlds,  
(who live upto a cycle) including Brahma the creator who has a  
fabulously long life of ten thousand billion years has to be afraid of Me.  
So if one wants a real protector that one should not have such  
infirmities. Such a protector without any infirmity is only God.  
The great Vaishnava acharya Shri Vedanta Desika tells this in his  
Ashtabhujashtakam. (5).  
अभीतिहेतोरनुवर्तनीयं नाथ त्वदन्यं न विभावयामि।  
भयं कुतः स्यात् त्वयि सानुकम्पे, रक्षा कुतः स्यात् त्वयि जात रोषे ॥   
Meaning:- O Lord! to get rid of fear I do not think that anyone other  
than You is to be sought after. When You are kindly inclined  
from where will fear arise? On the other hand, if You are not kindly  
inclined who is there to protect me?  
And again in Kamasikashtakam (8) he says:  
त्वयि रक्षति रक्षकैः किमन्यैः, त्वयि चारक्षति रक्षकैः किमन्यैः?  
When You are there to protect me what use is there by others? If You do  
not think of protecting me then again what use is there of others?  
Because of the fact that God is the only real protector, the practice  
of invoking the Lord's names in different parts of the body has been  
in vogue from time immemorial. We find in Shri Bhagavatam the gopis  
invoked God's protection in child Krishna's body after they found Him  
playing on the huge body of Putana after she died. The following  
verses give this in detail.  
गोमूत्रेण स्नापयित्वा पुनर्गोरजसार्भकम् ।  
रक्षां चक्रुश्च शकृता द्वादशाङ्गेषु नामभिः ॥ २०॥  
Having bathed the boy with the urine of a cow (which is held to be as  
sacred as the water of the holy Ganga) and again sprinkling him with  
the dust under the hoofs of cows (which is considered to be as good  
as sprinkling with the totality of all sacred waters) they (further)  
ensured his security by daubing him with cowdung (which is recognised  
as another seat of goddess Lakshmi) at twelve points while uttering  
(twelve different) names (of the Lord).(20).  
(NOTE:-The twelve names to be uttered on such occasions and the twelve  
limbs to be touched while doing so are specified in the following verse  
of the Padma Purana.  
      ललाटे केशवं ध्यायेन्नारायाणमथोदरे ।  
      वक्षःस्थले माधवं तु गोविन्दं कण्ठकूबरे ॥  
  
      विष्णुं च दक्षिणे कुक्षौ बाहौ च मधुसूदनम् ।  
      त्रिविक्रमं कन्धरे तु वामनं वामपार्श्वके ॥  
  
      श्रीधरं वामबाहौ तु हृषीकेशं तु कन्धरे ।  
      पृष्ठे तु पद्मनाभं च कट्यां दामोदरं न्यसेत् ॥   
Meaning:- One should visualise Keshava on one's forehead, Narayana on the  
belly, Madhava on the breast and Govinda on the back of one's neck,  
Vishnu in the right side of the abdomen and madhusudana on the right  
arm, Trivikrama on the neck, Vamana on the left side (of the abdomen),  
Sridhara on the left arm and Hrishikesa again on the neck, Padmanabha  
 on the back and Damodara on the waist.)  
गोप्यः संस्पृष्टसलिला अङ्गेषु करयोः पृथक्।  
न्यस्यात्मन्यथ बालस्य बीजन्यासमकुर्वत ॥ २१॥  
Having sipped water and assigned (a number of seed letters (representing  
the first letters of the following eleven names of the Lord followed  
by a nasal sound (Anuswara) separately to the (diverse) limbs of their  
(own) body as well as to (the parts of) their hands, the cowherd women  
next assigned the same seed letters to the limbs and (parts of) the  
hands of the baby.(21)  
अव्यादजोऽङ्घ्रि मणिमांस्तव जान्वथोरू यज्ञोऽच्युतः कटितटं जठरं हयास्यः ।  
हृत्केशवस्त्वदुर ईश इनस्तु कण्ठं विष्णुर्भुजं मुखमुरुक्रम ईश्वरः कम् ॥ २२॥  
May Aja (the birthless Lord) protect your feet; Manman (the Lord adorned  
with the KAustubha gem) your knees and Yagna (the deity presiding  
over sacrifices) your thighs; Achyutha (the immortal Lord) your loins;  
Hayagriva (the Lord endowed with the head of a horse) your abdomen;  
Kesava (the ruler of even Brahma and Siva) your heart; Isa (the  
almighty Lord) your bosom and Ina (the master) your throat; Vishnu  
(all pervading Lord) your arms; Urukrama(the Lord with long strides)  
your mouth and Ishvara (the supreme Lord) your head. (22).  
चक्र्यग्रतः सहगदो हरिरस्तु पश्चात् त्वत्पार्श्वयोर्धनुरसी मधुहाजनश्च ।  
कोणेषु शङ्ख उरुगाय उपर्युपेन्द्रस्तार्क्ष्यः क्षितौ हलधरः पुरुषः समन्तात् ॥ २३॥  
May the wielder of a discus stand (as your protector) before you and Sri  
Hari endowed with a mace behind you; the slayer of Madhu ans Ajana  
(the birthless Lord) wielding (severally) a bow and a sword stand on  
your two sides; Urugaya (sung by many) the wielder of a conch at the  
(four) points intervening between the quarters; LOrd VAmana (the younger  
brother of INdra) overhead; the rider of Garuda on the ground and the  
Supreme Person (Lord Sankarshana) wielding a plough on all sides.(23).  
      इन्द्रियाणि हृषीकेशः प्राणान्नारायणोऽवतु ।  
      श्वेतद्वीपपतिश्चित्तं मनो योगेश्वरोऽवतु ॥ २४॥  
  
      पृश्निगर्भस्तु ते बुद्धिमात्मानं भगवान्परः ।  
      क्रीडन्तं पातु गोविन्दः शयानं पातु माधवः ॥ २५॥  
  
      व्रजन्तमव्याद्वैकुण्ठ आसीनं त्वां श्रियः पतिः ।  
      भुञ्जानं यज्ञभुक्पातु सर्वग्रहभयङ्करः ॥ २६॥  
May Hrishikesa protect your Indriyas; Narayana your vital airs; Vasudeva  
(the Lord of Svetadvipa)your intellect; Aniruddha (the master of yoga)  
your mind; Pisnigarbha (Pradyumna) your understanding; and Sankarshana  
(the all-destroying Lord) your ahankara (ego). May Govinda (who sports  
in thesenses) protect you while you are at play; Madhava while lying  
down; Vaikunta while walking; the Lord Of Sri while seated; and the  
Enjoyer of sacrifices inspiring terror in all evilspirits while you are  
dining(24-26)  
      डाकिन्यो यातुधान्यश्च कुष्माण्डा येऽर्भकग्रहाः ।  
      भूतप्रेतपिशाचाश्च यक्षरक्षोविनायकाः ॥ २७॥  
  
      कोटरा रेवती ज्येष्ठा पूतना मातृकादयः ।  
      उन्मादा ये ह्यपस्मारा देहप्राणेन्द्रियद्रुहः ॥ २८॥  
  
      स्वप्नदृष्टा महोत्पाता वृद्धा बालग्रहाश्च ये ।  
      सर्वे नश्यन्तु ते विष्णोर्नामग्रहणभीरवः ॥ २९  
Malevolent spirits such as) Dakinis, Yatudanis,and Kusmandas, evil  
spirits that seize their victims taking the form of babes, Bhutas,  
Pretas and Pisachas, Yakshas, Rakashasas, and Vinayakas, Kotara, Revati,  
Jyeshta, Putana, (the sixteen) Matrikas and others (such as Charaki  
andnJwalamuka), Unmadas (evil spirit causing insanity) and Apasmara  
(those inducing apoplexy), that actually torment the body and sense  
organs and interfere with the vital functions of those responsible for  
evil portents of a grave nature seen in dreams and those that seize  
the aged as well as youngsters (alike) -terrified at the mention of  
the names of Lord Vishnu, may all these (evil spirits) die out. (27-29).  
  
Thus it is clear that the Lord alone can be the source of true protection.  
So, He has he name (Vishnusahasranama-935)  
भयापहः भयं संसारजं पुंसामपघ्नन् भयापहः ।  
and Devi has the name भयापहा in Lalthasahasranama (121).  
भयानि जलस्थलादि-प्रयुक्तादीनि सर्वाण्यपहन्तीति भयापहा ।  
तथा च वायुपुराणे - अरण्ये प्रान्तरे वापि जले वापि स्थलेऽपि वा ।  
व्याघ्रकुम्भीरचोरेभ्यो भयस्थाने विशेषतः ।  
आधिष्वपि च सर्वेषु देवीनामानि कीर्तयेद् - इति ।  
This says that one caught in the midst of a forest or in a desolate  
place, in the sea,or anywhere in the land or while in fear of animals  
like tiger or shark or thieves or in mental pain should chant Devi's  
names. Shri Appayya Dikshita, the great poet and devotee echos this  
thought in verses 12 and 13 in his Durga Chandrakala Stuti.  
      कान्तारमध्यदृढलग्नतयाऽवसन्ना  
           मग्नाश्च वारिधिजले रिपुभिश्च रुद्धाः ।  
      यस्याः प्रपद्य चरणौ विपदस्तत्रन्ति  
           सा मे सदाऽस्तु हृदि सर्वजगत्सवित्री ॥ १२॥  
Those who have lost their way in the dense forest and are distressed,  
those who are floundering in the deep seas and are struggling to reach  
safety, those who are being attacked by enemies they will find their  
problems eased by surrendering at the feet of Durga.  
      बन्धे वधे महति मृत्युभये प्रसक्ते  
           वितक्षे च विविधे च महोपतापे ।  
      यत्पादपूजनमिह प्रतिकारमाहु-  
           स्सा मे समस्तजननी शरणं भवानी ॥ १३॥  
Great men have said that fear of incarceration, being killed, death,  
loss of wealth, varities of other fears such as fear from government  
agencies, thieves, serpants, animals etc., will be removed by worshipping  
the Mother. I surrender to that Devi. Shri Shankaracharya was very much  
aware of the fact that if one has God in his heart one need not fear  
anything. So, he asks in Sivanandalahari (44) from where will fear come  
when he has the Lord Shiva in the recess of his heart -Shiva the one  
who holds a deer in one hand, has destroyed Gajasura and Vyagrasura,  
who takes into Himself all beings at the time of pralaya, who resides  
in mount Kailasa and has a white complexion.  
करलग्नमृगः करीन्द्र-भङ्गो घनशार्दूल-विखण्डनोऽस्त-जन्तुः ।  
गिरिशो विशदाकृतिश्च चेतः-कुहरे पञ्चमुखोऽस्ति मे कुतो भीः? ॥   
So, it should be our endeavour to firmly establish one's favourite  
deity, be it Rama, Krishna or Shiva or Devi or any other form by  
earnest prayers to Him and be rid of any fear. The question, then is,  
how to firmly establish one's favourite God in our minds. While people  
may talk of different ways, Shrimad Bhagavatam shows the easy way. It  
is listening to His stories or words known as श्रवणम्. Today we  
should include reading them also in this.  
      शृण्वतां स्वकथां कृष्णः पुण्यश्र्वणकीर्तनः ।  
      हृद्यन्थःस्थो ह्यभद्राणि विधुनोति सुहृत्सताम् ॥   
This says that Krishna is the friend of the virtuous, Lisetening to  
His praises sanctify those who listen or sing them. He abides in the  
heart of those who hear His stories and uproots the evil propensities  
of their mind. (Shrimad Bhagavatam-1-2-17). Such statements are to  
be seen in abundance in this holy book. Today we are indeed blessed  
because the expositions of holy books by learned scholars are easily  
available to us in several media like radio, TV, internet, ebboks and  
internet. Repetedly listening to such holy books and reading them  
will gradually winnow away the blemishes of the heart like anger, greed,  
lust etc and make it pure and a fit abode for the Lord to stay.
