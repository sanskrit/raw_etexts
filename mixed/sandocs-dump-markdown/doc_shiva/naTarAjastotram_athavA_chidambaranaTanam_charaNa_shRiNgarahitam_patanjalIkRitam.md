 नटराजस्तोत्रम् , चरण शृङ्ग रहित (पतञ्जलि)   
चिदम्बरनटननं च  
  
This hymn is by Sage Patanjali, the author and compiler of the famous  
yogasUtra . Once upon a time, as the story of the origin of  
the hymn goes, Nandi, Shiva's carrier would not allow Patanjali Muni to have  
Darshan of the Lord Shiva (Nataraja of Chidambaram).  In order to reach Lord  
Shiva, Patanjali, with his mastery over grammatical forms,  
spontaneously composed this prayer in praise of the  
Lord without using any extended (`dIrgham') syllable,  
(without `charaNa' and `shRi~Nga' i.e . leg and horn) to tease Nandi.  
Shiva was quickly pleased, gave Darshan to the  devotee, and danced to the  
lilting tune of this song .  
The place where this incidence is said to have happened is  
Chidambaram (also known as Thillai), located about a  hundred miles  
from Madras, Tamilnadu, India . It is considered to be  one of the  
holiest places in India . In this temple, which has a gold covered roof,  
Lord Nataraja is present in a cosmic-dancing form . Many books have been  
written on the greatness of the temple and its deity and can also be inferred  
from various hymns composed in praise of the Lord by the Shaiva  
Siddhanta Saints.  
Please refer to http://www.geocities.com/Athens/2583  
for more information and detailed description of Shaiva Siddhanta.  
The translation of the hymn is based on Smt . Usha Bhise's and is taken from  
the book `caranasrngarahitam natarajastotram.' This book also contains a sanskrit  
commentary on this stotra by Chandrakala . The book was published by Bharati  
Samskrta Vidya Niketanam in 1992-

words in it lead to the perception of the   the Lord's pair of feet.  
It flows on, being beginningless and endless (composed of the meter

into the ocean of worldly existence which causes great sorrow and sinfulness.
