From Sri Niyama Kshetra Mahatmyam  
  
Sri Nemam – Nemam  
nemam or shrii nemam is located on the southern  
side of the Cauvery belt in thirukaatupaLLi,  
Tanjore district, Tamil Nadu.  Conforming to the  
traditions of Tamil Nadu’s township pattern,  
a Shiva temple by name airAvateshwara, facing the  
east and a Vaishnav temple, facing the west is  
found in this place.  Pleased with the staunch  
devotion, stupendous rituals and persistent  
meditation of the people, the Lord voluntarily  
desired to go over to this holy place and shower  
His grace; and living there gives a sense of  
pride and happiness; His grace is carefully  
protected by the kshetra.  
  
kAshI and rAmeshvaram are considered to be  
important kshetra-s in Bharat.  People however  
claim that the aura in, and the importance of,  
this kshetra are much higher than those two.  
One could feel innately in this place, the  
divine grace of the Lord spread all over India.  
The kshetra enjoys the following powers:    
  
- Proximity to the river Cauvery;  
  
- brahmateertha, sudhA kUpam (well), baaNa  
kUpam and similar teerthas’ capacity to  
purify the soul;  
  
- The demised person’s holy ash when buried,  
becomes a Linga to attain the realization  
of Shiva;  
  
- The Lord clears the sins and sorrow of  
the devotee who utters His names and/or the  
pancAkShara mantra and purifies his body,  
intellect and the soul;  
  
- The Lord’s consort shrii alankAravalli, makes  
everyone realize that she occupies a special  
place in their hearts as a mother, relative and  
lovable divine power to attain enlightenment by  
the personification of Her kindness.  
  
- She, the alankaari, manifests as the mother at  
every moment as alankAravalli, that Her divine  
grace is all-pervasive and omnipresent across  
the kshetra.  
  
Recognized by the purAnAs as one among the  
few important kshetras, its history can be  
found in brahmOttara kANDA of brahmANDapurANa.  
shri airAvatham iyer – kumAra swaminAtha  
iyer compiled its history from palm leaves and  
protected it in handwritten grantha lipi.  His  
grandson, and owner of mAtangi publications, shri  
S shriidharan, has now taken the responsibility  
of publishing this book.  
  
Around shrii nemam, there are plenty of  
shivasthalAs which worship airAvateeswara  
as their presiding deity, some of which  
are: aayirathaLi, arikulakesareeshwaram,  
nirupakesareeshwaram, chandramalliishwaram,  
attupaLLi, etc.  The Cauvery floods, the fight  
amongst the rulers closer to the place and the  
invasion of Malik Kafur had damaged thousands of  
temples, reducing this area from a mammoth town  
to a tiny village.  With the Lord’s grace,  
it would get back its original size and glory.  
  
The purANAs would vouchsafe the fact that  
this kshetra existed in brAhma kalpa before  
the present svetavarAhakalpa.  During the  
krutayuga, at the time when tirupArkadal  
(milk ocean) was churned to get the amrutA, a  
portion of this amrutA got spilled over in this  
place out of which a pArijAta tree sprouted to  
become a pArijAta vanA for the Lord to reside  
there; and the place to be called as pArijAta  
vanam, brahmapuri, indirapuri, puShpavanam,  
airAvateshwaram and nemam.  Elders would say  
that as the people were living with lot of  
self-restraint and discipline, the place came  
to be called as nemam.  History would also state  
that these elders were able to reach the abode of  
the Lord for the reason that shri alankAravalli  
voluntarily guided them to achieve the feat of  
bliss and enlightenment.  
  
When a devotee of shrii alankAravalli raised his  
left hand to deliver his blessings to a Chozha  
king, the king got angry that an inappropriate  
protocol was observed; the devotee explained to  
the king that the right hand which worships the  
Lord had immense illumination and keerthi (fame,  
glory) which a human cannot bear.  
  
The grace of shrii alankAravalli is matchless  
that both children and the Heavens would  
celebrate it with joy and happiness. Closer to  
nemam, there is a place called Pazhamaarneri.  
A resident by name mahAdeva dikShitar was  
a pundit and intellectual but was not very  
popular.  He was praying to shrii alankAravalli  
to bless him with a child.  On Her command, he  
went to Madurai to worship Goddess meenAkshi.  
At that time, Madurai was ruled by a famous  
king thirumalai nAyakan.  He had a minister by  
name neelkantha dikShitar who did not honour  
the visitor.  On learning that mahAdeva was  
sent by shrii alankAravalli, he rushed to pay  
his respects to mahAdeva and extended him a  
warm hospitality. This story was informed to  
us by Shri Mahaperiyavaa and it is mentioned in  
deivathin kural, volume 4.  
  
There is yet another story on shrii  
alankAravalli.  You will find two deities with  
the same name here.  Several thousand years  
back, either because of floods in cauvery  
or Malik Kafur’s atrocities, the idol of  
shrii alankArvalli got buried in the sands.  
The villagers searched for it most meticulously  
but failed; heartbroken, they made an identical  
idol and started worshipping it.  It so happened  
the original idol that got buried surfaced  
itself one fine day, that the villagers raised  
another kOShTa and installed the deity there.  
It seemed to be yet another inscrutable and  
divine play of Hers to demonstrate that both of  
Them were one and the same.  
  
The crematorium in nemam is located near  
brahmateertham.  Instead of dissolving the ash  
of the dead, it is buried near this teertham.  
The purAnA-s seek to explain that this act is  
much sacred and holier than dissolving the ash  
in Ganga.  
  
Devotees would have the darshan of the Lord  
airAvateshwara from outside the temple with the  
illumination gained from the glittering lamp  
in the sannidhi.  In order not to obstruct the  
darshan, nandikeshvar sits in a deep pit. During  
the times of hot summer when the river bed gets  
dried up, it has been noticed that if you fill up  
this pit with the water sinking nandikeshvar,  
you do get rains to your surprise and awe.  
Inasmuch the Lord can be worshipped from outside,  
there is a small dvaara on the wall of the  
sanctum sanctorum through which you can happily  
have the darshan of shrii alankAravalli.  
  
On the southern side of the temple, Lord  
dakShinAmoorthy grants siddhi to those who  
have been initiated into different mantras.  
Then, you will find Lord Vishnu in His divine  
posture.  The amudha koopam is located on the  
southern side; the brahma teertham and the  
baNa teertham are located outside the temple.  
Since the practice of conducting rituals near  
these teerthas are not in vogue, they have  
become pathetically dilapidated.  Whence the  
way of living of our people changes to seeking  
His blessings, these teerthas, would naturally  
get back their purity and sanctity.  
  
There are seven kshetras around tiruvaiyaru  
called saptasthAna kshetras.  Including  
nemam, the other six are: thirukAttupaLLi,  
thiruchennampooNDi, thirukaanoor, vAnavarAngudi,  
thiruchadaivaLandai and chendalai.  
  
With their deep insights and experience our  
elders have proved that when we worship the  
Lord with love, unflinching faith and care,  
He manifests himself as our Father, Mother,  
Friend and Teacher (guru) as well to enhance  
the value of our life.
