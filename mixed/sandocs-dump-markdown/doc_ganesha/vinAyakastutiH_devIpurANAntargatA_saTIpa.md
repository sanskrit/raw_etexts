The concept of gaNapati can be traced back to the Vedic  
literature. Some scholars opine that worship of gaNesha was  
in vogue before the advent of the Aryans and the latter had  
adopted this tradition. The references to gaNapati in the  
Vedic literature denote gaNapati as gaNAnAm pati or the  
lord of the herd. He is not the pot-bellied god which we  
are acquainted with. We do not find gaNapati's references  
in the main upaniSads. But the gANapatyupaniSad, taittirIya  
AraNyaka mention names like gaNapati, mahAgaNapati, vakratuNDa,  
dantI etc. The early gRRihyasUtras and the dharmasUtras do  
not mention the worship of gaNapati either. The baudhAyana  
sUtras refer to gaNapati being the elephant headed and  
the master of obstacles. gaNapati came to eminence as a  
deity in the Epic-Puranic age. In the purANas various myths  
regarding his birth appeared. Along with these we find the  
iconographical descriptions of his forms. The agnipurANa, the  
brahmavaivartapurANa, the vAmanapurANa, the varAhapurANa, the  
padmapurANa and the garuDapurANa are the main purANas in which  
the cult of gaNapati has been dealt with. The gaNeshapurANa  
and the mudgalapurANa are the only two upapurANas which  
treat extensively about the gaNesha worship and the cult. We  
may, therefore, say that gaNesha is a typically Puranic  
deity. Several theories have been established about the origin  
of gaNapati as he is the only animal-headed deity in the Indian  
pantheon. Mostly he has been shown as the son of Lord Shankara  
and goddess pArvatI. ShankarAchArya's pa~nchAyatanapUjA has  
several verses in praise of gaNapati. It is said that gaNapati  
worship had been adopted by the Tantriks during sixth/seventh  
century. Dr. R.C. Hazra opines that gaNapati came to have  
elephant's head earlier than the 6th century A. D. which  
can be determined by the sculptural, epigraphic and literary  
evidences.[1]  
  
The devIpurANa, one of the important shAkta upapurANas from  
the medieval period, is considered as a great authority on the  
worship of the Mother Goddess. The work professing shaktism,  
had been recognized by the early smRRiti writers of different  
parts of India, as an authoritative hand book of religious  
and social matters. Many digest texts based on the devIpurANa  
are prevalent in Bengal and are considered as the manual  
of religious rites. The society and social structure have  
changed considerably, but these texts are even now important  
as far as the religious instructions are concerned. Besides  
dealing with the exploits and worship of the devI, the purANa  
gives an account of eulogies by/of Lord viShNu, Lord sUrya and Lord  
vinAyaka. The legend of vinAyaka depicted in the three chapters  
of the purANa, is however, quite different from those delineated  
in other purANas. It is Lord viShNu who eulogizes vinAyaka to  
get rid of the demon vighnAsura. The story of the origin of  
the demon vighna, his rise and his end has been interwoven  
with the worship of Lord vinAyaka. (Chs. 112-114)  
  
Lord brahmA, while seated in penance, was once infatuated by  
ego. He began to think himself as the whole and sole of the  
three worlds by neglecting Lord sha~Nkara and Lord viShNu. All  
or a sudden a fire broke out from the left side of his face  
and from there emerged a terrific demon named vighna who  
overpowered all the gods including brahmA. In order to subdue  
the demon, viShNu created vighnesha gaNapati and sought help  
by eulogizing him.  
  
The myth regarding the birth of gaNapati in the text is as  
follows- Once Lord viShNu, while sporting with goddess lakShmI in  
the mount mAlavya, created gajAnana suddenly by rubbing his hand  
(11.112). Immediately all the gods contributed their power in  
the growth of gaNesha. The sun and the moon became his eyes,  
brahmA his head, the trees became his hair and the Rudras  
were his throat, the stars and planets were his teeth. The  
dharma and adharma became his lips, and goddess sarasvatI was  
his tongue and the ten directions were his ears. Lord indra  
appeared in gaNapati's nose, Lord mahAdeva sat in between  
his eyebrows, the seas became his stomach. yakSha, rakShas,  
gandharvas, pishAchas were settled in his abdomen, shriyAdevI  
was seated in his heart. It is to be noted that gaNapati,  
in the devIpurANa, has been referred to as svayambhU and  
anAyaka. He is again addressed as pramatheshajAta, born from  
pramathesha and shaktitanaya, son of shakti.  
  
viShNu prays to gajavaktra, the elephant faced god who is  
copper coloured complexion and has tooth as white and bright  
as conch shell or moon or the kunda flower, to intervene  
in the demon-god battle and help the god to subjugate  
vighnAsura. gaNapati has such a huge body that it obstructs  
the orbits of sun and moon and even it pushes meru mountain  
downwards. The demons are very much apprehensive to face his  
valour. He is wearing a huge garland string with wild flowers  
and designed in row of stars. The bees are humming near his  
secreted throat. Like Lord pramatha his head is crowned with  
serpents and yoginIs are offering service to him. His roar  
sounds like the bell. The demons elephants are stuck on the  
tip of his tooth. His complexion is as red as red lotus. He  
is served by the jeweled fan. His huge ears are like the leaf  
of palAsha. His beautiful eyes extend up to his ears. He is  
holding some weapons in one hand and in one of his left hands  
he holds a lADDu. Lords like brahmA, indra, chandra, vasu,  
shankara are gratifying him. gaNesha is the god who bestows  
his devotee with whatever he desires. He helps his devotees  
to overcome all hurdles.  
  
The attributes of vinAyaka in the devIpurANa illustrate  
nicely his character as the one who is the destroyer of  
vighna, the problem personified. Image of the god can be  
classified into terrific and pacific types according to  
the portrayal of nature of the deity. The terrific or the  
raudra image is characterized by sharp, long tusks and nails,  
and a large number of hands carrying weapons. It also has  
wide eyes and fire round its head. The raudra form of images  
are worshispped for the attainment of objects requiring for  
violence. The shAnta form of images are peaceful looking in  
appearance and are worshipped for the attainment of peaceful  
aims and objects. The Hindu theism attributes various names  
and powers to a particular deity and sculpt images according  
to the attributed nature. We find almost 91 types of gaNapati  
with four hands, six hands, ten hands and twelve hands from the  
iconography described in the purANas, tantras, Agamas and the  
idols found in different temples. In the devIpurANa we find the  
vinAyaka gaNapati in raudra form as he has been depicted as the  
protector of the three worlds. The text does not mention the  
number of hands vinAyaka has. He must be having at least six  
hands as he is holding a daNDa, an aऽNkusha, parashu, mekhalA,  
and sUtra in his hands. The weapons in the deity's hands are  
all of symbolic significance. parashu is a battle axe. gaNesha  
is parashudhara, the destroyer of the evil. aऽNkusha is an  
elephant's driver's hook. This symbolizes the control power,  
control over the misdeeds. It is also j~nAnashakti. The  
controlling weapon in the right hand indicates controlling  
capacity of the brain. mekhalA is a girdle or belt, may be a  
serpent indicatinig the latent kulakuNDalinI. daNDa is a staff  
or a club. laDDu is a type of sweet resembling happiness and  
bliss. It also symbolizes life. vinAyaka is wearing a crown,  
a coiled snake. It represents the kuNDalinI shakti which has  
been elevated to the head. This means vinAyaka has attained the  
yogic power and has become yogeshvara. He has beautiful broad  
ears like conch shell. The broadness represents the hearing  
power of the oMkAra by which one can be free from life and  
death circle. He has a huge body, an elephant face and a big  
tusk. The elephant having a gigantic body is an irresistible  
force that can face as well as progress through all odds. The  
elephant head stands for the organs of cognition and action. The  
tusk stands for concentration. vinAyaka is stated to have served  
by the yoginIs. Since ancient times vinAyaka had a close  
connection with the seven mAtRRikAs. The devIpurANa does not  
mention the number of yoginIs, the text may have indicated the  
seven mAtRRikAs. The seven mAtRRikAs or the yoginIs are the  
forces of gaNesha. No reference to mouse as gaNesha's mount  
is referred to here.  
  
Digressions from the main theme are numerous in the  
devIpurANa. Though this is a shAkta upapurANa yet it establishes  
gaNapati as the supreme, even superior than the other gods. The  
text mentions some practices or methods of worship or the vows  
or rituals connected with the gaNapati worship in two separate  
chapters.[2] It does not contain any instruction for making  
of image. But the iconographic feature of gaNapati described  
in the text shows some Tantric influence. In Tantric rituals  
worship of gaNesha, mAtRRis and grahas are performed prior  
to every auspicious event. The yoginIs' association with the  
deity and the weapons and ornaments mentioned bear the same  
significance. The text, though, is lacking in enough material  
regarding the gaNesha cult the stava depicted here may be an  
important addition to the gaNapati stotras as the devIpurANa  
is a very little known work and is not much studied.

2. Chapter 69 in the devIpurANa explains gaNayAga where it  
has been said that one, who has experienced a terrible dream  
should perform a ritual in order to satisfy gaNapati. The  
rite includes offering of meat, fish and wine along with  
sweetmeats like curd, pAyasa,(milk with rice) modakas prepared  
with jaggery etc. to gaNapati and also offering of flowers,  
durvA and white mustards to his mother ambikA. Chapter 70  
mentions rakShAvidhAna of gaNapati. The mantras like oM  
vinAyakAya gaum namaH, gAM hRRidayAya namaH, gIM shiraH, gUm  
shikhA, gaiM netre, goM kavacham, gaH astram should be written  
in silver plate or in bhurjapatra (birch bark) and one has to  
perform some rites so that he can live long and healthy and  
can get rid of all obstacles.
