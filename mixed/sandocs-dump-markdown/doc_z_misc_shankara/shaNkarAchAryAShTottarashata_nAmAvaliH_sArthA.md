१) ॐ श्रीशङ्कराचार्यवर्याय नमः

१०) ॐ सूक्ष्म-तत्त्व-रहस्य-ज्ञाय नमः  
 I bow to shrI shankara who knows the intricate and secret  
tattvam. The word tattvam which is often used to mean philosophy is

intricate truth is the identity of Atman and brahman.  
११) ॐ कार्याकार्यप्रबोधकाय नमः  
 I bow to shrI shankara who taught about ᳚what that needs to be done᳚

living.

gesture. There is specific gesture known as jnAna mudrA. This mudra is  
also known as chinmudra. In this one joins the tip of the thumb with  
the tip of the index finger forming a circle.  The term jnAna mudrA  
also means one who gives (ra) the bliss (mud) of jnAna.  
१३) ॐ शिष्यहृत्तापहाराकाय नमः  
 I bow to shrI shankara who destroys the heat or obstacles that  
trouble the hearts of his disciples. He destroys that heat by

lalita sahasranAmam praises shrI mAtA as ᳚तापत्रयाग्नि सन्तप्त  
साम्ह्लादन चन्द्रिका᳚, Like HER, shrI shankara destroys the tApa by

was shrI shankara who established it firmly through his bhAshyams on  
upaniShads, bhagavad gIta and brahmasUtra, prakaraNa granthas and  
through establishment of mAthas.  
१७) ॐ साक्षाच्छङ्कररूपभृते नमः

भव एव भवा निति मे नितरं समजायत चेतसि कौतिकिता मम  
वारय मोह महाजलधिं भव शङ्कर देशिकमे शरणम्  
  
 and the famous verse attributed to padmapAda which he realized and  
uttered during the great debate between shrI vedavyAsa and shrI  
shankara

᳚trayI᳚.

 I bow to shrI shankara who knew the intricate and subtle philosophy

digvijayas he increased the spiritual power of many temples by
