Introduction  
============  
  
From time immemorial man has been preparing to face  
uncertainties and struggling to overcome difficulties in  
life. Broadly speaking the difficulties and conflicts he  
faces can be categorised as physical on the one extreme and  
spiritual on the other, intervened by various other stages  
like ethical, intellectual, emotional, filial, occupational,  
professional, societal, national and so on. While enormous  
education, training and efforts go into tackling difficulties,  
conflicts and uncertainties at the basest physical level  
onwards, these are waning with the progression to the noblest  
spiritual level. It is towards strengthening in this direction  
that man has evolved rituals and faith in that Universal  
Power and set out in search thereof. Ideally, man should turn  
everything he does into sacred with a view to know himself and  
his God and towards this strengthen all his faculties. SandhyA  
vandana, worship of Gods three times a day at the junctures  
of Night-Morning-afternoon-evening, invoking their blessings  
and strength, is one such important activity.  
  
Brahmanas  
=========  
  
A Brahmana deserves to be called so only when he  
conducts himself in the ways approved in the scriptures  
and also performs at least the basic ritual called trikAla  
SandhyA-vandana. SandhyA vandana is a daily duty for a Brahmana  
after upanayana. It is very auspicious and sacred also. TrikAla  
SandhyA vandana means paying obeisance to the Lord, three times  
a day, i.e., during sun rise, noon and sun-set. It is called  
SandhyA Vandana also because the obeisance is offered at the  
junctures of 1. Night and day, 2. morning and afternoon, and  
3. Day and night. The first one, prAtaH SandhyA, is performed  
when the sun is about to rise and the stars are still aglitter  
in the sky. The second one, mAdhyAhnika, is performed during  
the noon time. The third one sAyaM sandhyA, is performed just  
before the sunset. These junction times are regarded as highly  
sacred for this purpose.  
  
Preparation  
===========  
  
The basic preparation is to cleanse the body externally.  
For prAtaH SandhyA, it will be by means of the morning bath  
and for the other two it will be by means of washing the  
legs, hands and face. After this, You will wear clean clothes  
specially meant for this purpose.  The practice is to wear a  
dhoti and a shalya.  
  
Thereafter, quietly sit on either a kR^iShNAjina (deer-skin  
seat) or on wooden plaque placed on the floor, in the pooja  
room (select some other neat place if pooja room is not  
available. While for prAtaH SandhyA you can face either East  
or North, for the other two you have necessarily to face  
North. Keep readily available minimum three vessels, two  
with clean water (one for Achamana and the other for Arghya)  
and ladle (spoon) and the third one empty (arghya pAtra).  
Also ensure that you have complete privacy during the whole  
process and avoid external noises like music systems, TV,  
talking to others etc.  
  
You will also take the following steps for prAtaH SandhyA  
only. Keep a set of mudras (five metallic stamps with different  
shapes explained later) and gopichandana (a special variety of  
mud ball). Then, apply gopichandana on your body. Generally,  
if available, nirmalya tIrtha (holy remnant water after deva  
pooja by self or someone) is used for this purpose. In case  
of unavailability of nirmAlya tIrtha i.e. Arghya Water can  
also be used.  
  
Start the process invoking the blessings of the Lord by reciting  
the following mantras.  
  
श्री लक्ष्मीवेङ्कटेशाय नमः ॥  
  
श्री गुरुभ्यो नमः । परम गुरुभ्यो नमः ॥  
  
श्रीमदानन्दतीर्थ भगवत्पादाचार्य गुरुभ्यो नमः ॥  
  
श्री वेदव्यासाय नमः ॥  
  
हरिः ॐ ॥  
  
गोपीचन्दन पापघ्न विष्णुदेह समुद्भव ।  
चक्राङ्कित नमस्तेऽस्तु धारण मुक्तिदो भव ॥  
  
Simultaneously, place a spoon of water (either nirmalya  
or Arghya Water) on the left hand palm, take a piece  
of gopichandana, rub vigorously and prepare a paste of  
gopichandana. Apply this paste at 12 places in the body - one on  
forehead, three on abdomen, one on chest, one each on shoulders,  
all 4 parts of neck, one on bottom of back-bone just above trunk  
and one on top of head. Then, one more is applied on the right  
side of the chest.  Some people do also apply a similar final  
mark on the left side of the chest, if this is the tradition  
that they have been taught as per their sampradAya (custom).  
While applying, recite Keshavadi Dwadashanama (explained below),  
one nAma each for one application.  
  
The order for applying nAmas are -- on the forehead (keshavAya  
namaH), center of abdomen (nArAyaNAya namaH), chest (mAdhavAya  
namaH), front portion of neck (govindAya namaH), right side  
of abdomen (viShNave namaH), right shoulder (madhusudhanAya  
namaH), right side of neck (trivikramAya namaH), left side of  
abdomen (vAmanAya namaH), left shoulder (shrIdharAya namaH),  
left side of neck (hR^iShIkeshAya namaH), back side (above  
tunk) (padmanAbhAya namaH), back side of neck (dAmodarAya  
namaH) and on the head, on the chest (shrIvatsAya namaH).  
The shapes of the paste applied will be as follows. On the  
forehead : one set of vertical parallel lines (first apply the  
paste with the forefinger and later run through it with a wet  
cloth/finger). On the chest: heart (lotus leaf) shape. On the  
shoulder: leaf shape (preferably with a stem).  Elsewhere:    
deepAkAra (burning candle light shape). Concentrate on the  
mantra and quickly go through the process of applying the  
paste instead of trying to perfect the shapes.  
  
After applying gopichandana, apply mudras as follows in  
that order.  
  
chakra mudra: one on right side of eye, five on centre of  
abdomen, three on heart, two on right of abdomen, three on  
right of chest, two on right shoulder both sides of nAma, two  
on right of neck, one on front of neck, one on left shoulder  
below the nAma.  
  
shankha mudra - one on left side of eye, one on left of abdomen,  
two on left of chest, two on left shoulder both sides of nAma,  
two on left of neck, one on right shoulder below the nAma.  
  
gadA mudra - one on forehead, one on left of abdomen, one on  
left of chest, two on left shoulder both sides of nAma below  
shankha mudra.  
  
padma mudra - two on chest, two on right abdomen, two on right  
shoulder both sides of nAma below chakra mudra.  
  
nArAyaNa mudra - one each overlapping on all mudras and nAma.

यः स्मरेत्पुण्डरीकाक्षं सबाह्याभ्यन्तरः शुचिः ॥

प्राणायामः ................... (2)  
  
(This is preamble for Gayatri Awahana i.e. welcome, for this  
Sri Hari or ParamAtmA is R^iShi devatA and devI gAyatrI is  
Channdassu.  Practice of prANAyAmah cleanses one of impurities  
and provides a resurgence of spiritual energy to revitalize  
one's sAdhana.  
  
In order to extinguish the sins or effect of base deeds in the  
previous night for prAtaH SandhyA this verse is uttered. The  
pramAna says that this mantra will destroy all the sins  
committed previously or previous night if it is prAtaH SandhyA,  
morning if it is mandhyanika SandhyA and it is afternoon till  
evening if it is sAyam SandhyA.)  
  
ॐ प्रणवस्य परब्रह्म ऋषिः । परमात्मा देवता ।  
देवी गायत्री छन्दः । प्राणायामे विनियोगः ॥  
  
ॐ भूः । ॐ भुवः । ॐ स्वः । ॐ महः । ॐ जनः । ॐ तपः ।  
ॐ सत्यं । ॐ तत्सवितुर्वरेण्यं । भर्गो देवस्य धीमहि धीयो यो नः  
प्रचोदयात् । ॐ आपोज्योतीरसोऽमृतं ब्रह्म भुर्भुवःस्वरोम् ॥  
  
(A married man should hold the nose in all His five fingers  
while performing this and bachelors and saints/seers should hold  
through three fingers i.e.  index, thumb and small fingers. This  
prANAyAmaH has three parts to perform and it is called rechaka,  
pUraka and kumbhaka. To start with one has to leave the air  
from right side of the nose (1 unit of time) that is called  
rechaka, secondly one has to inhale the air from left side of  
nose (2 units of time) i.e. called pUraka and finally holding  
the air for 3 units of time i.e. is called kumbhaka.  
  
Meaning of this mantra is as follows : OM = ParamAtmA who  
has all the virtues is to be called OM, bhUH = gunapUrna  
(complete virtues or characters), bhuvaH = wealthy and never  
become pauper or most prosperous, svaH = always happy, mahaH =  
prayed as the best or excellent, janaH = creation of the world  
by Him, tapaH = one who has the complete knowledge, satyaM =  
one who controls or decides about the liberation.  
  
yaH = this paramAtmA, naH = ours, dhIyaH = mind, prachodayAt  
= initiates, tasya = of this paramathmA, savituH = cause of  
creation, devasya = special characters, vareNyaM = prayed by  
all, bharga = paramAthmA in knowledge form, dhImahi = pray  
for Him.  
  
Apo = paramAtmA, jyoti = cause of brightness, rasaH = has got  
essence or substance or Ananda rUpa peaceful, amR^itaM = does  
not have extinction, bhUH = complete virtues or characters,  
bhuvaH = prosperous and wealthy always, svaH = always happy,  
OM brahma = all virtues of ParamAtmA, dhImahi = praying for You.  
  
The gist of this verse is:    
  
Sri Hari in the form of Sri Gayatri is complete with all divine  
virtues, always prosperous and wealthy, always happy, considered  
to be the best or excellent, one who creates this world, one who  
regulates this world and one who is being prayed by all of us.  
  
Further, Sri Hari or paramAtmA also has the power of creating  
the brightness (enlightenment), does not have extinction,  
has complete knowledge, is always prosperous and wealthy and  
has got complete virtues, is the paramAtmA (Supreme Being)  
whom I am praying.)  
  
सङ्कल्पः ..................... (3)  
  
(Hold right palm over the left palm and keep them on the  
right thigh and utter the following mantra )  
  
श्री शुभे शोभने मुहूर्ते विष्णोराज्ञया प्रवर्तमानस्य  
आद्य ब्रह्मणः द्वितीये परार्धे श्री श्वेतवराह कल्पे

प्रातः सन्ध्यामुपाशिष्ये ।  
  
(For any prayer or performance of any sacred work whether  
it is SandhyA, puja, yagna, or any ritual performed by any  
individual this customary sankalpa has to be narrated. It  
denotes the commitment and determination of the performer  
to rightfully and sincerely perform such sacred rituals.  
Here in this sankalpa it is nothing but remembering which  
of the samvatsara (year), period or season (R^itau), month  
(mAse), the half of lunar month (pakShe), lunar day (tithau),  
day (vAsare), star of the day (nakShatre) has to be to according  
to the calendar. KAla, i.e. kAladevata is equally God. Even one  
has to remember that the prayer is initiated by paramAtmA and  
to get His blessings and love, I am performing the respective  
ritual.  This is a must as it has been understood that without  
this sankalpa the prayer or ritual will not materialise or  
not received by the God.  
  
The need for this is to totally concentrate on the present  
moment instead of the usual mind's habit of either brooding  
over the past or dreaming of the future.)  
  
मार्जनम् ....................... (4)  
  
(Keep a spoon or ladle of water (Arghya Water) in the left  
hand and from tulasi or basil leaves sprinkle the water in three  
different directions to the organs of the body. Firstly one has  
to sprinkle feet, centre of the head and heart, secondly heart,  
feet and centre of the head and finally centre of the head,  
heart and feet like this one has to sprinkle three ways or  
nine times)  
  
ॐ आपोहिष्ठेति त्र्यर्चस्य सूक्तस्य । सिन्धुद्वीप ऋषिः ।  
अपो देवता गायत्री छन्दः । मार्जने विनियोगः ॥   ........ (4.1)

(mArjanam means cleansing or scouring. It is again purifying  
the body and mind for offering Arghya and chanting Gayatri  
mantra.  
  
For R^ik mantras sindhudvIpa is R^iShiH, paramAtmA is devatA  
and Gayatri is Chandassu.  
  
Here is the substance of this verse. It is prayer to Water  
related devatAs (aqua-Gods).  
  
᳚ Hey, Water related devatAs, You are bestowing on us happiness  
by causing the water to flow, and You bless us with grains  
and other related needs and also confer on us devotion and  
knowledge towards Sri Hari which guides all of us in the path  
of liberation. ᳚  
  
᳚ Hey, Water related devatAs, You are auspicious, You are very  
eminent, You are bestowing on us happiness and joy and confer on  
all of us love like mothers feeding and protecting their newborn  
kids. In order to destroy the sins which we have committed and  
also to acquire knowledge we are praying Sri Narayana who is  
omnipresent in the water and whom we are praying to bless us to  
lead a happy life and also to liberate us at the earliest. ᳚ )  
  
जलाभिमन्त्रणम् ...................... (5)  
  
(While uttering this, take a spoon of water (Arghya Water)  
and sip it after completing the following portion)

(The verse which has started with sUryascha, Narayana is  
R^ishi, manyupathi ratri niyamaka durga is devatA and it is  
in prakR^iti Chandassu.  
  
᳚ Hey, paramAtmA, You are the one who controls the Sun who is  
very bright, You are the one who controls Sri Rudra who is known  
for His wildness You protect us from the sins which are caused  
by the ferocity and the initiatives of Sri Rudra devatAs. ᳚  
  
᳚ Hey, paramAtmA, please also protect me from not committing  
sins like, sins during night times, sins from mind, sins by  
mouth or talking or speaking, sins through hands, sins from  
feet, sins from belly and sins through the sex organs. If  
I commit any sins, ratrI abhimani (related) devatA should  
bless me to wipe it off and if any of my sins are over, I  
am performing homa (burnt offering) of the same to You i.e.,  
Sri Narayana who is shining in the form of Sun . ᳚ )

᳚ Apashabda vAchya Sri ParamAtma, You bless us with the wealth  
of needs like drinking water, happiness and good health. ᳚  
(6.3)  
  
᳚ Apashabda vAchya Sri ParamAthma, the grains which are grown  
through water mainly referring to rice and like food grains,  
You are the owner. You confer on us the knowledge of medicine

(6.4)  
  
᳚ There are different medicines in water which can cure many  
diseases. Hey, ParamAtma You have manifested in the form of  
of water to bless us with the knowledge to understand these  
curative medicines. ᳚   (6.5)  
  
᳚ Hey, ParamAtma, bless us with the preventive medicine  
i.e. knowledge for all diseases of my body and soul so that  
for long time I can visualize You in my life. ᳚  (6.6)  
  
᳚ Hey, ParamAtma, if I have committed any sins, if I have  
betrayed anybody and if I have cursed anybody or if I have  
mistaken any body please pardon me. ᳚  (6.7)  
  
᳚ Hey, ParamAtma, now I am following Your directions and Your  
principles and I am drowning in water, You are like fire in  
the water and rescue me and infuse in me Your energies. ᳚  (6.8)  
  
There is a definite relationship between water and Narayana. Sri  
Hari is incarnated and is omnipresent in water. Sri Hari  
created water-related amruta (knowledge) to lead us towards  
liberation. For this purpose He created day and night abhmimani  
(related) devatAs. For acquisition of knowledge and protection  
of my body (from any diseases) I am welcoming You (Narayana)  
to reside in my soul and body.  (6.9))

(While uttering this verse take a spoon of water (Arghya  
Water) in right-palm then after completing the verse inhale  
the water from right side of the nose and exhale the air from  
the left side of the nose and pour out the water on the earth  
on one's left side.  
  
This verse is from pApaparihari RishiH, satya and bhakti devatA  
and anuShTup Chanddassu . You should have the feeling that  
in order to extinguish the sins committed you are offering,  
symbolically, a spoon full of water.  (7.1)  
  
Before Brahma thought about anything, ParamAtma created truth,  
from the same ParamAtma night was born and from the same  
ParamAthma ocean was born.  
  
ParamAtma, the supreme head of everything, created the following  
in that order: four-headed Brahma, night, day and all kinds  
of living beings.  
  
ParamAtma, one who is the cause of creation has created first  
the Sun and the moon, then He created heaven, then He created

(Pratah Arghya should be offered facing the Sun i.e. facing  
East, you should be in standing position, seeing the Sun,  
both the hands should fold make like cow's face or bowl and  
it should be up to your nose's height.  
  
Write this figure (yantra) and words (preferably in devanagari  
script) using your small finger in the bowl where arghya  
offering water (Arghya Water) has been kept:  
  
                               ॐ  
                               /

There is story behind this offering Arghya : Mandeha's  
were powerful AsurAs (demons) and they are devoted to Sri  
Brahma. They got a boon from Him that even if they die one  
day they should be born the next day. They were trying to  
consume the Sun God himself as a result of these Arghyas;  
Whenever they were killed, because of Brahma's blessings they  
are born the next day. It is believed this process goes on even  
now. In order to kill these AsurAs and to protect the Sun God  
for illuminating all of us, we have to offer three Arghyas on  
each occasion. Three Arghyas are offered as follows: the first  
one is to destroy the AsurAs' vehicle, the second to destroy  
their weapons and the third to kill them. This story has been  
explained in Vishnu Purana of 8th chapter.  
  
If the prescribed time for performing SandhyA has passed,  
You have to offer the fourth Arghya as compensation.)

(For pratichakShva verse VashiShta is R^ishI, Moon and  
Indra are devatAs and anuShTup Channadassu. This verse is for  
obtaining eligibility and capability for offering Arghya and  
protection of the soul.  
  
The presence of Moon and Indra is invoked to watch out AsurAs  
see that the later will not spoil the process of performing  
SandhyA and prevent the performer realising the benefits  
thereof. It is believed that both Sun and Indra are capable  
of killing or destroying these AsurAs, who cause impediments  
and even destroy the process of performing sacred rituals.  
The Lord Indra, the head of devatAs, uses His weapon, Vajrayudha  
for the purpose.)

with the first 12 names of Vishnu (keshava etc.) and during  
krishna pakSha (second half of lunar month) it is given with  
the 12 names starting from sankarshana. The procedure for  
giving tarpaNa is: take one ladle full of water from Arghya  
Water in left hand and pour it on right hand fingers so that  
it falls through the fingers (except thumb) to 'Arghya PAtra'.  
This tarpaNa should not be given on ekadashi, gokulAShTami)

(Paravasu was killed, I am living in the hearts of  
arvahasu. This has been told by Surya (Sun). By reciting  
this cut a thread of the cloth worn by you and make two small  
pieces. Throw the one on the left hand, on the left side and  
keep the other under the seat.  
  
Silently think like this. Earth is like four poles i.e. four  
sides (North, South, East and West) having a seat like the  
turtle/tortoise (referring to kurma incarnation). I am sitting  
on that. ParmAtma is sleeping on top of snake (shesha) bed. I  
am bowing to You. I am bowing to Vishnu Kurma (tortoise)  
one who is protecting the earth (Brahmanda) from destruction.  
  
For Prithvi verse merupR^iShTha is R^ishi kUrma (tortoise)  
is the devatA sutalam is Channdassu. After this, settle on  
the seat for chanting Gayatri MantraH.  
  
Prayer to Prithvi i.e. earth. All regions of Loka are covered  
by You, Prithvi Namaka Daivi, You are decorated by Vishnu vakya  
ParamAtma. Hey, Prithivi, You authorise me by purifying the  
seat where I am sitting.  Prithivi, You also purify me. You  
are very special and I am bowing You.  By uttering this,  
touch the seat and bow to it.  
  
ParamAtma is called as OM; He has got the form of Brahma and  
Agni devatA.  Like the same Brahma is R^ishi, Gayatri Chanddassu  
and in the form of OM.  
  
'AyAtu' verse is to welcome Gayatri. For this verse Vasudevaka  
ParamAthma is R^ishi, Gayatri Pratipadya Narayana is devatA  
and it is in anuShTup Channdassu.  
  
᳚ Hey, Wealth bestowing devatA, bless us with Brahma verse  
(Gayatri) which is immortal and is considered to be the mother  
of all Vedas (Gayatri); Please bless me Para Brahma (Gayatri  
verse). By uttering this Gayatri verse all the sins committed  
by me in my daily life will be destroyed (extinguished). ᳚  
  
᳚ I am praying to ParamAthma, who is in the form of Saraswathi  
who is also SandhyA devatA and knowledge devatA. Please  
extinguish, through the night related devatA who is none other  
than Sri Hari, all my sins committed in the night. ᳚  
  
This is a prayer to ParamAtma who is in the form of Gayatri. ᳚  
Hey, ParamAtma - You are instrumental for everything, You  
have all the patience, You have all the powers, You have the  
vision, for devatAs You are Sharanya (protecting them), You  
are omnipresent, You have complete form, You are controlling  
everything, You are instrumental for everybody's life-activities  
and enemies are being defeated by Your single word 'OM'. By  
all the above things You are being called Paramatma by the  
name Gayatri, the same Gayatri I am inviting in my mind  
(AhvAna), I am welcoming Savitri, I am welcoming Saraswati,  
I am inviting Chhanddassu, R^ishis, Parabrahma, I am inviting  
LakShmi and Vayu who is well known for His powers. ᳚  
  
For Gayatri verse, Gayatri is Channdassu, Vishwamitra is R^ishi  
and ParamAtma who is called very sacred (savitR^inamaka). This  
ParamAtma is in the following form : His appearance is like fire  
in His body, His face is like four headed Brahma, He has got  
the heart which is covered by the whole universe, He appears  
like Rudra, He has the Sankarshana's hair, He is the earth,  
He has yoni sthana, He has five vital airs like prANa, apAna,  
vyAna, udAna and samAna and He has upa prANa like devadatta,  
kurma, kR^ikara, dhananjaya and nAga, His colour appears like  
blood and He belongs to sankhyasana gotra. He has been called  
in 24 keshava nAmas, His presence is there in all three places  
i.e.. earth, vaikuntha and pAtAla, He has covered in all four  
regions (i.e. North, South, East and West), He has five heads  
like vyakarana, shikSha, kalpa, nirukta and jyotiSha this  
Gayatri I am praying and worshipping.)

(For this Gayathri verse, Vishwamitra is R^ishi, Sri LakShmi  
Narayana is devatA, in order to impress Sri LakShmi Narayana,  
and in order to get love and affection from Sri LakShmi Narayana  
I am reciting this according to my abilities and capabilities.  
  
While reciting the japa, imagine the following picture of  
Sri LakShmi Narayana who is the subject and object of your  
prayer. They are :    
  
Settled in the centre of the Sun, He is sitting in the posture  
of a yogi (padmasana), He has been decorated with the ornament  
of shoulder, He has worn ear rings, He has put head gear,  
He has the necklace, He has the body of hiranya and He has  
conch shell and wheel on His both hands. The same Sri LakShmi  
Narayna is the subject and object of my prayer. This prayer is  
initiated by Sri LakShmi Narayana and I am praying to please  
Him and to get love from Him. I am chanting this verse sincerely  
according to my abilities and capabilities.  
  
Take note of the following guidelines while reciting Gayatri Japa :    
  
1. Laughing/Smiling, talking with others, looking here and  
there, sitting other than in the posture of yogi, hands  
together, allowing the mind to wander, touching the places  
which are below the navel portion etc., which are all unholy,  
should not be done.  
  
2. Reciting should be with calmness and peace of mind.  
  
3. PrataH SandhyA Gayathri japa can be recited by standing  
and facing towards the East till the Sunrise. Later it can be  
recited either standing or sitting.  But Madhyanika Gayathri  
japa and Sayam SandhyA Gayathri japa should be recited only  
sitting.  
  
4. While counting the beads, cover the right hand either by the  
left hand or with a cloth and the number of Gayatri mantraH to  
be recited should be ten or in geometrical progression thereof  
(i.e. 100, 1000 etc.)  
  
5. Pause after every 5 verses.  
  
6. There are three methods of uttering Gayatri verses. One is  
by uttering loudly, second is whispering i.e. speaking through  
lips without being heard by any body and third silently chanting  
in your mind, always dwelling on their meaning. It is believed  
that the third method is better than the second and second  
one is better than the first.  
  
7. Counting of the Gayatri verses should be done through finger  
beads on circular basis in clockwise direction. Start counting  
from middle bead of ring finger (1), come down to bottom bead  
(2), traverse through bottom (3), middle (4) and top bead (5)  
of little finger, top of ring finger (6),  
 8. Hands should rest just above the navel during Pratah  
 SandhyA, on the  
chest during Madhyahnika and on the nose during Sayam SandhyA.  
  
9. Generally, the Gayatri japa should be performed at the same  
place where SandhyA is performed.)

(It is also believed that one should recite nArAyaNa  
aShTAkShara mantra after the Gayatri japa. It should be in 1:3  
proportion, i.e.for every 10 Gayatri, you should recite 30  
narayana aShTAkShara mantra. After reciting that, for every  
10 Narayana aShTAkShara MantraH you should offer one Arghya  
i.e. in above case you have to offer 3 Arghyas.)
