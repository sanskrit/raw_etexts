Translation of Srichandrasekharabharatinavaratnamalika  
  
A Bejewelled Garland of Nine Verses on Jagadguru  
Sri Chandrasekhara Bharathi Mahaswamigal  
  
An offering of the Sringeri Jagadguru  
His Holiness Bharathi Theertha Mahaswamigal  
  
(1) I seek refuge in Jagadguru Sri Chandrasekhara Bharathi  
Mahaswamigal, an ascetic committed to rescuing the people  
drowning in the ocean of phenomenal existence.  
  
(2) I pay obeisance to Him, whose attire is ochreous, who has  
a gentle smile on His face, who bestows all that is wished  
for, whose ornaments are traits like control of the mind and  
restraint of the senses and whose host of noble qualities can  
be reckoned only by Adisesa with a thousand mouths.  
  
(3) I resort to Him, the auspicious Lord, whose body is more  
lustrous than gold, whose speech resembles the flow of the  
Ganges and who nullifies the terrible poison of transmigratory  
existence.  
  
(4) I ever take shelter in Him, who is an ocean of mercy, who  
is worthy of even My Guru’s praise, who has an unmatched  
intellect, whose face is like the rising sun and who is  
accessible to all people.  
  
(5) For the removal of mental dullness, I constantly hold in My  
heart the foremost samnyasin, whose intellect is most splendid,  
whose speech is exceedingly sweet and whose feet ought to be  
saluted by all.  
  
(6) I always offer prostrations to Him, who takes care of His  
numerous devotees, who is versed in the profound essence of  
Vedanta, whose gaze is indrawn and who is benevolent to the  
three worlds.  
  
(7) I take refuge in the best of Guru-s, who eradicates sorrows,  
whose face is beautiful like the full moon, who is devoted  
to Lord Siva and whose conduct is commendable even to the  
celestials headed by Indra.  
  
(8) I extol Him, the very utterance of whose name destroys  
sins, who has the power to curse and to shower grace, who is  
a fire that burns up the forest of afflictions and whose pair  
of feet is saluted even by kings.  
  
(9) In My heart, I offer reverential prostration to Jagadguru  
Sri Chandrasekhara Bharathi Mahaswamigal, a great gem in the  
garland of pontiffs of the Sringeri Sharada Peetham founded  
by Sankara Bhagavatpada.
