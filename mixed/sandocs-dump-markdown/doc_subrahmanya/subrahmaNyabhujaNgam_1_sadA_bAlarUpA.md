 श्रीसुब्रह्मण्य भुजङ्गम् १   
  
 Comments by Ravishankar Mayavaram msr@comco.com  
  
shrI subrahmaNya bhujaN^gam is a stotra sung under inspiration  
by shrI Adi shankarAchArya at Thiruchendur ( presently located in  
Tamil Nadu, India). When he meditated upon shrI subrahmaNya, he  
became aware of the self luminous light shining in his heart and words  
came out his mouth in extempore in bhujanga metre. It is also said  
that AchArya then actually saw the AdisheSha worshipping the Lord  
and adopted the bhujanga metre.  
  
Major portion of the translation provided here is adopted from,  
Iyer, Ganesa M., Srimat Sankara Bhagavat Padal's Sri  
Subrahmanya Bhujangam, The Little flower Company, Madras, 1992.  
  
Invocation of shrI vighneshvara  
  
  
सदा बालरूपाऽपि विघ्नाद्रिहन्त्री  
      महादन्तिवक्त्राऽपि पञ्चास्यमान्या ।  
विधीन्द्रादिमृग्या गणेशाभिधा मे  
      विधत्तां श्रियं काऽपि कल्याणमूर्तिः ॥ १॥   
Though he always sports the appearance of a child, he can crumble the  
the mountains of obstacles. Though he is elephant--faced, he is  
honored even by his five--faced father Shiva (sadyaojAtam, vAmadevam,  
aghoram, tatpuruSham and IshAnam). Lord Brahma, Indra and the other Devas  
seek him to fulfil their aspirations. He is known as Ganesha and he is  
endowed with boundless glory. May he bless me with wealth!  
  
AchAryA's humility  
  
  
न जानामि शब्दं न जानामि चार्थं  
      न जानामि पद्यं न जानामि गद्यम् ।  
चिदेका षडास्य हृदि द्योतते मे  
      मुखान्निःसरन्ते गिरश्चापि चित्रम् ॥ २॥   
I know not the science of musical sounds, I know not the meanings of  
complex texts either, I know not the nature of shlokas made of four  
types of padAs, and nor do I know the intricacies of the Gadyam style!  
But in my heart, shines a effulgent light with luminous six faces, and  
because of that from my mouth, amazing phrases with musical tone and  
meanings pour out in extempore.  
  
This shloka brings out the humility of the AchArya, who is  
considered as the greatest jnani, poet, and yogi who walked on the face of  
this earth. Meditating on the verse will bring wisdom to the aspirant.  
  
      Lord as the Goal of VedAs  
  
  
मयूराधिरूढं महावाक्यगूढं  
      मनोहारिदेहं महच्चित्तगेहम् ।  
महीदेवदेवं महावेदभावं  
      महादेवबालं भजे लोकपालम् ॥ ३॥   
When shrI shankara sang this verse, it is said that Lord  
Subrahmanya gave him darshan.  
  
O Son of Mahadeva! Seated on the peacock chariot, being the essence of  
the great mahA vAkyAs, having wonderfully attractive body, dwelling  
in the heart of great sages, O the quintessence of four vedas!  
Thou are indeed the Lord of the Universe.  
      Reason for residing on the sea shore  
  
  
यदा सन्निधानं गता मानवा मे  
      भवाम्भोधिपारं गतास्ते तदैव ।  
इति व्यञ्जयन्सिन्धुतीरे य आस्ते  
      तमीडे पवित्रं पराशक्तिपुत्रम् ॥ ४॥   
O Lord Subrahmanya! son of spotless parAshakti [the Mother of the  
Cosmos], Thou have taken the your abode near the sea shore (Thiruchendur  
is a coastal town) as if it is indication that whenever the devotees  
take refuge in Thee, they can easily cross the ocean of Samsara (the eternal  
cycle of life and death) and reach the other side of the shore safely!  
Destroyer of devotee's difficulties  
  
  
यथाब्धेस्तरङ्गा लयं यान्ति तुङ्गा-  
      स्तथैवापदः सन्निधौ सेवतां मे ।  
इतीवोर्मिपङ्क्तीर्नृणां दर्शयन्तं  
      सदा भावये हृत्सरोजे गुहं तम् ॥ ५॥   
The waves of worries that haunt the minds of the devotees get  
destroyed like the waves of the ocean when they hit the shore, Thou  
stands on the sea-side town of Thiruchendur exemplifying this truth  
that the mental worry-waves get destroyed when the devotees surrender  
themselves at Thy feet. O Lord Guha (one who resides in the cave of  
the heart)! I meditate on you always!  
Glory of Sugandha Hill  
  
  
गिरौ मन्निवासे नरा येऽधिरूढा-  
      स्तदा पर्वते राजते तेऽधिरूढाः ।  
इतीव ब्रुवन्गन्धशैलाधिरूढः  
      स देवो मुदे मे सदा षण्मुखोऽस्तु ॥ ६॥   
O Lord ShanmukhA! Thou stands on the top of the Sugandha hill,  
proclaiming that whenever the devotees climb this hill it will give  
the same benefit as climbing the king of mountains (Kailas)! May the  
six-faced lord on the Sugandha hills remain there to bless me!  
  
      Glory of Lord Guha  
  
  
महाम्भोधितीरे महापापचोरे  
      मुनीन्द्रानुकूले सुगन्धाख्यशैले ।  
गुहायां वसन्तं स्वभासा लसन्तं  
      जनार्तिं हरन्तं श्रयामो गुहं तम् ॥ ७॥   
On the shores of the great ocean which steals away the sins of the  
devotees, stands the Sugandha hills, the most favourable site  
for the sages to perform their penance! Thou resides there to destroy  
the worries of the devotees! O self-luminous Lord who is present in  
the cave of the heart! I adore Thee!

समुद्यत्सहस्रार्कतुल्यप्रकाशं  
      सदा भावये कार्तिकेयं सुरेशम् ॥ ८॥   
In a radiant golden bed room, on a cot set with rubies and covered on  
all sides with sweet smelling flowers, Thou art seated with the  
effulgence of thousand suns! Thou art the answer to every desire of  
the heart and Thou fulfils the righteous desires of Thy devotees! Thou  
art the lord of devas and son of the lord of the universe! O  
KartikeyA I meditate on Thee!

हतेन्द्रारिषण्डाञ्जगत्राणशौण्डान्  
      सदा ते प्रचण्डान् श्रये बाहुदण्डान् ॥ १२॥   
Oh! Shanmuga!  Thy arms punished Brahma, Thy arms governs the world as  
Thy play, Thy arms killed  Soorapadma and other demons who are

and Thy arms are a terror to Thine enemies.  I worship Thy twelve  
arms which does all these things effortlessly.
