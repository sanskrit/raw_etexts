 श्रीलक्ष्मणगीता रामचरितमानससे   
  
दोहा  
  
सिय सुमन्त्र भ्राता सहित कन्द मूल फल खाइ ।  
सयन कीन्ह रघुबंसमनि पाय पलोटत भाइ । ८९ ।  
  
Having partaken of the bulbs, roots and fruits alongwith Sita, Sumantra and His  
brother (LakShmana), the Jewel of Raghu's race lay down to sleep, while His  
brother kneaded His feet. (89)  
  
चौपाई  
  
उठे लखनु प्रभु सोवत जानी । कहि सचिवहि सोवन मृदु बानी ।  
कछुक दूरि सजि बान सरासन । जागन लगे बैठि बीरासन । १ ।  
गुहँ बोलाइ पाहरू प्रतीती । ठावँ ठावँ राखे अति प्रीती ।  
आपु लखन पहिं बैठेउ जाई । कटि भाथी सर चाप चढ़ाई । २ ।  
सोवत प्रभुहि निहारि निषादू । भयउ प्रेम बस हृदयँ बिषादू ।  
तनु पुलकित जलु लोचन बहई । बचन सप्रेम लखन सन कहई । ३ ।  
भूपति भवन सुभायँ सुहावा । सुरपति सदनु न पटतर पावा ।  
मनिमय रचित चारु चौबारे । जनु रतिपति निज हाथ संवारे । ४ ।  
  
When LakShmana perceived that his lord had fallen asleep, he rose and asked the  
minister in soft accents to retire. As for himself he got ready his bow and  
arrows and sitting at some distance in the posture of a hero he kept watch. Guha  
called his trusted watchmen and stationed them at different points with great  
love; while he himself went and took his seat beside LakShmana with a quiver  
fastened to his waist and an arrow fitted to his bow. When the NiShada chief saw  
his lord lying (on a bed of grass and leaves) he felt great sorrow in his heart  
due to excess of love; the hair on his body bristled, tears flowed from his eyes  
and he addressed the following affectionate words to LakShmana: `The king's  
palace is naturally charming; even Indra's residence can hardly stand comparison  
with it. Its beautiful atics are built of precious gems and are so lovely as  
though the god of love has constructed them with his own hands.' (1-4)  
  
दोहा  
  
सुचि सुबिचित्र सुभोगमय सुमन सुगन्ध सुबास ।  
पलँग ग मञ्जु मनिदीप जहँ सब बिधि सकल सुपास । ९० ।  
  
`Free from impurities, exceedingly marvellous of design, abounding in exquisite  
luxuries and scented with the fragrance of flowers, they are furnished with  
lovely beds and lighted with gems and are full of amenities of every  
description.' (90)  
  
चौपाई  
  
बिबिध बसन उपधान तुराईं । छीर फेन मृदु बिसद सुहाईं ।  
तहँ सिय रामु सयन निसि करहीं । निज छबि रति मनोज मदु हरहीं । १ ।  
ते सिय रामु साथरीं सोए । श्रमित बसन बिनु जाहिं न जोए ।  
मातु पिता परिजन पुरबासी । सखा सुसील दास अरु दासी । २ ।  
जोगवहिं जिन्हहि प्रान की नाईं । महि सोवत तेइ राम गोसाईं ।  
पिता जनक जग बिदित प्रभाऊ । ससुर सुरेस सखा रघुराऊ । ३ ।  
रामचन्दु पति सो बैदेही । सोवत महि बिधि बाम न केही ।  
सिय रघुबीर कि कानन जोगू । करम प्रधान सत्य कह लोगू । ४ ।  
  
Again they are equipped with coverlets and sheets, pillows and cushions of  
various kinds-all soft, white and charming as the froth of milk.  It is in such  
attics that Sita and Rama used to sleep at night and humbled by their beauty the  
pride of Rati and her consort, the god of love. Those very Sita and Rama are now  
lying on a pallet, exhausted and uncovered, a sight one cannot bear to see. The  
same Lord Rama whom his father and mother, his own family and the people of the  
city, his good-natured companions, men- servants and maid-servants, all  
cherished as their own life, sleeps on the ground ! Nay, Sita, whose father  
Janaka is famed throughout the world, whose father-in-law is King Dasharatha,  
the chief of Raghus and an ally of Indra (the lord of immortals) and whose  
spouse is Ramacandra, is lying on the ground! An adverse fate spares none. Do  
Sita and the Hero of Raghu's race deserve to be exiled to the woods? They  
rightly say: `Fate is supreme.' (1-4)  
  
दोहा  
  
कैकयनन्दिनि मन्दमति कठिन कुटिलपनु कीन्ह ।  
जेहिं रघुनन्दन जानकिहि सुख अवसर दुखु दीन्ह । ९१ ।  
  
`The foolish daughter of Kekaya has wrought a cruel mischief in that she has  
brought trouble on Sita and the Delighter of Raghu's race at a time of  
enjoyment.' (91)  
  
चौपाई  
  
भइ दिनकर कुल बिटप कुठारी । कुमति कीन्ह सब बिस्व दुखारी ।  
भयउ बिषादु निषादहि भारी । राम सीय महि सयन निहारी । १ ।  
बोले लखन मधुर मृदु बानी । ग्यान बिराग भगति रस सानी ।  
काहु न कोउ सुख दुख कर दाता । निज कृत करम भोग सबु भ्राता । २ ।  
जोग बियोग भोग भल मन्दा । हित अनहित मध्यम भ्रम फन्दा ।  
जनमु मरनु जहँ लगि जग जालू । सम्पति बिपति करमु अरु कालू । ३ ।  
धरनि धामु धनु पुर परिवारू । सरगु नरकु जहं लगि ब्यवहारू ।  
देखिअ सुनिअ गुनिअ मन माही । मोह मूल परमारथु नाही । ४ ।  
  
`The wicked woman has played the axe in felling the tree of the solar race and  
plunged the whole universe in woe.' The NiShada chief was sore distressed to see  
Rama and Sita sleeping on the ground. LakShmana spoke to him sweet and gentle  
words imbued with the nectar of wisdom, dispassion and devotion: 'No one is a  
source of delight or pain to another; everyone reaps the fruit of one's own  
actions, brother. Union and separation, pleasurable and painful experiences,  
friends, foes and neutrals-snares of delusion are these. Even so birth and  
death, prosperity and adversity, destiny and time and all the illusion of the  
world; lands, houses, wealth, town and family, heaven and hell, and all the  
phenomena of the world; nay, whatever is seen, heard or thought of with the mind  
has its root in ignorance: nothing exists in reality.' (1-4)  
  
दोहा  
  
सपनें होइ भिखारि नृपु रङ्कु नाकपति होइ ।  
जागें लाभु न हानि कछु तिमि प्रपञ्च जियँ जोइ । ९२ ।  
  
`Suppose in a dream a king becomes a pauper and apauper becomes lord of  
paradise; on waking, the one does not gain nor does the other lose  
anything. So must you look upon this world.' (92)  
  
चौपाई  
  
अस बिचारि नहिं कीजिअ रोसू । काहुहि बादि न देइअ दोसू ।  
मोह निसाँ सबु सोवनिहारा । देखिअ सपन अनेक प्रकारा । १ ।  
एहिं जग जामिनि जागहिं जोगी । परमारथी प्रपञ्च बियोगी ।  
जानिअ तबहिं जीव जग जागा । जब सब बिषय बिलास बिरागा । २ ।  
होइ बिबेकु मोह भ्रम भागा । तब रघुनाथ चरन अनुरागा ।  
सखा परम परमारथु एहू । मन क्रम बचन राम पद नेहू । ३ ।  
राम ब्रह्म परमारथ रूपा । अबिगत अलख अनादि अनूपा ।  
सकल बिकार रहित गतभेदा । कहि नित नेति निरूपहिं बेदा । ४ ।  
  
`Reasoning thus be not angry nor blame anyone in vain. Everyone is slumbering in  
the night of delusion, and while asleep one sees dreams of various kinds. In  
this night of mundane existence it is Yogis (mystics) alone who keep awake-Yogis  
who are in quest of the highest truth and remain aloof from the world. A soul  
should be deemed as having awoke from the night of the world only when he  
develops and aversion for the enjoyments of the world of sense. It is only when  
right understanding comes that the error of delusion disappears and then alone  
one develops love for the feet of Shri Rama (the Lord of Raghus). O friend, the  
highest spiritual goal is this: to be devoted to the feet of Shri Rama in  
thought, word and deed. Shri Rama is no other than Brahma (God), the supreme  
Reality, unknown, imperceptible, beginningless, incomparable, free from all  
change and beyond all diversity. The Vedas ever speak of Him in negative terms  
(not this).' (1-4)  
  
दोहा  
  
भगत भूमि भूसुर सुरभि सुर हित लागि कृपाल ।  
करत चरित धरि मनुज तनु सुनत मिटहिं जग जाल । ९३ ।  
  
`For the sake of His devotees, Earth, the Brahmanas, cows and gods, the gracious  
Lord takes the form of a man and performs actions by hearing of which the snares  
of the world are broken asunder.' (93)  
  
  
चौपाई  
  
सखा समुझि अस परिहरि मोहू । सिय रघुबीर चरन रत होहू ।  
कहत राम गुन भा भिनुसारा । जागे जग मङ्गल सुखदारा । १ ।  
  
  
`Realizing this, O friend, shed all infatuation and be devoted to  
the feet of Sita and the Hero of Raghu's race.'
