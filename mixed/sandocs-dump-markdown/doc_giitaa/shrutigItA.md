The text is from Srimad BhAgavatam, Skandha 10 ,Ch 87, verses 14-41.  
The meanings are extracted from http://home.att.net/~gitaprasad/BhPurantm  
  
14. The srutis said: Victory, victory to You, O unconquerable one! By  
Your very nature You are perfectly full in all opulences; therefore  
please defeat the eternal power of illusion, who assumes control over  
the modes of nature to create difficulties for conditioned souls. O You  
who awaken all the energies of the moving and nonmoving embodied beings,  
sometimes the Vedas can recognize You as You sport with Your material  
and spiritual potencies.  
  
15. This perceivable world is identified with the Supreme because  
the Supreme Brahman is the ultimate foundation of all existence,  
remaining unchanged as all created things are generated from it and at  
last dissolved into it, just as clay remains unchanged by the products  
made from it and again merged with it. Thus it is toward You alone that  
the Vedic sages direct all their thoughts, words and acts. After all,  
how can the footsteps of men fail to touch the earth on which they live?  
  
16. Therefore, O master of the three worlds, the wise get rid of all  
misery by diving deep into the nectarean ocean of topics about You, which  
washes away all the contamination of the universe. Then what to speak of  
those who, having by spiritual strength rid their minds of bad habits  
and freed themselves from time, are able to worship Your true nature,  
O supreme one, finding within it uninterrupted bliss?  
  
17. Only if they become Your faithful followers are those who breathe  
actually alive, otherwise their breathing is like that of a bellows. It  
is by Your mercy alone that the elements, beginning with the mahat-tattva  
and false ego, created the egg of this universe. Among the manifestations  
known as anna-maya and so forth, You are the ultimate one, entering  
within the material coverings along with the living entity and assuming  
the same forms as those he takes. Distinct from the gross and subtle  
material manifestations, You are the reality underlying them all.  
  
18. Among the followers of the methods set forth by great sages, those  
with less refined vision worship the Supreme as present in the region of  
the abdomen, while the Arunis worship Him as present in the heart, in the  
subtle center from which all the pranic channels emanate. From there,  
O unlimited Lord, these worshipers raise their consciousness upward  
to the top of the head, where they can perceive You directly. Then,  
passing through the top of the head toward the supreme destination, they  
reach that place from which they will never again fall to this world,  
into the mouth of death.  
  
19. Apparently entering among the variegated species of living beings  
You have created, You inspire them to act, manifesting Yourself according  
to their higher and lower positions, just as fire manifests differently  
according to the shape of what it burns. Therefore those of spotless  
intelligence, who are altogether free from material attachments, realize  
Your undifferentiated, unchanging Self to be the permanent reality among  
all these impermanent life forms.  
  
20. The individual living entity, while inhabiting the material bodies he  
has created for himself by his karma, actually remains uncovered by either  
gross or subtle matter. This is so because, as the Vedas describe, he is  
part and parcel of You, the possessor of all potencies. Having determined  
this to be the status of the living entity, learned sages become imbued  
with faith and worship Your lotus feet, to which all Vedic sacrifices  
in this world are offered, and which are the source of liberation.  
  
21. My Lord, some fortunate souls have gotten relief from the fatigue  
of material life by diving into the vast nectar ocean of Your pastimes,  
which You enact when You manifest Your personal forms to propagate the  
unfathomable science of the self. These rare souls, indifferent even to  
liberation, renounce the happiness of home and family because of their  
association with devotees who are like flocks of swans enjoying at the  
lotus of Your feet.  
  
22. When this human body is used for Your devotional service, it acts as  
one’s self, friend and beloved. But unfortunately, although You always  
show mercy to the conditioned souls and affectionately help them in  
every way, and although You are their true Self, people in general fail  
to delight in You. Instead they commit spiritual suicide by worshiping  
illusion. Alas, because they persistently hope for success in their  
devotion to the unreal, they continue to wander about this greatly  
fearful world, assuming various degraded bodies.  
  
23. Simply by constantly thinking of Him, the enemies of the Lord attained  
the same Supreme Truth whom sages fixed in yoga worship by controlling  
their breath, mind and senses. Similarly, we srutis, who generally see  
You as all-pervading, will achieve the same nectar from Your lotus feet  
that Your consorts are able to relish because of their loving attraction  
to Your mighty, serpentine arms, for You look upon us and Your consorts  
in the same way.  
  
24. Everyone in this world has recently been born and will soon die. So  
how can anyone here know Him who existed prior to everything else and who  
gave rise to the first learned sage, Brahma, and all subsequent demigods,  
both lesser and greater? When He lies down and withdraws everything  
within Himself, nothing else remains—no gross or subtle matter or bodies  
composed of these, no force of time or revealed scripture.  
  
25. Supposed authorities who declare that matter is the origin of  
existence, that the permanent qualities of the soul can be destroyed,  
that the self is compounded of separate aspects of spirit and matter,  
or that material transactions constitute reality—all such authorities  
base their teachings on mistaken ideas that hide the truth. The dualistic  
conception that the living entity is produced from the three modes of  
nature is simply a product of ignorance. Such a conception has no real  
basis in You, for You are transcendental to all illusion and always  
enjoy perfect, total awareness.  
  
26. The three modes of material nature comprise everything in this  
world—from the simplest phenomena to the complex human body. Although  
these phenomena appear real, they are only a false reflection of the  
spiritual reality, being a superimposition of the mind upon You. Still,  
those who know the Supreme Self consider the entire material creation  
to be real inasmuch as it is nondifferent from the Self. Just as things  
made of gold are indeed not to be rejected, since their substance is  
actual gold, so this world is undoubtedly nondifferent from the Lord  
who created it and then entered within it.  
  
27. The devotees who worship You as the shelter of all beings disregard  
Death and place their feet on his head. But with the words of the Vedas  
You bind the nondevotees like animals, though they be vastly learned  
scholars. It is Your affectionate devotees who can purify themselves  
and others, not those who are inimical to You.  
  
28. Though You have no material senses, You are the self-effulgent  
sustainer of everyone’s sensory powers. The demigods and material nature  
herself offer You tribute, while also enjoying the tribute offered them  
by their worshipers, just as subordinate rulers of various districts in a  
kingdom offer tribute to their lord, the ultimate proprietor of the land,  
while also enjoying the tribute paid them by their own subjects. In this  
way the universal creators faithfully execute their assigned services  
out of fear of You.  
  
29. O eternally liberated, transcendental Lord, Your material energy  
causes the various moving and nonmoving species of life to appear by  
activating their material desires, but only when and if You sport with  
her by briefly glancing at her. You, the Supreme Personality of Godhead,  
see no one as an intimate friend and no one as a stranger, just as the  
ethereal sky has no connection with perceptible qualities. In this sense  
You resemble a void.  
  
30. If the countless living entities were all-pervading and possessed  
forms that never changed, You could not possibly be their absolute ruler,  
O immutable one. But since they are Your localized expansions and their  
forms are subject to change, You do control them. Indeed, that which  
supplies the ingredients for the generation of something is necessarily  
its controller because a product never exists apart from its ingredient  
cause. It is simply illusion for someone to think that he knows the  
Supreme Lord, who is equally present in each of His expansions, since  
whatever knowledge one gains by material means must be imperfect.  
  
31. Neither material nature nor the soul who tries to enjoy her are ever  
born, yet living bodies come into being when these two combine, just as  
bubbles form where water meets the air. And just as rivers merge into  
the ocean or the nectar from many different flowers blends into honey,  
so all these conditioned beings eventually merge back into You, the  
Supreme, along with their various names and qualities.  
  
32. The wise souls who understand how Your Maya deludes all human beings  
render potent loving service to You, who are the source of liberation  
from birth and death. How, indeed, can fear of material life affect  
Your faithful servants? On the other hand, Your furrowing eyebrows—the  
triple-rimmed wheel of time—repeatedly terrify those who refuse to take  
shelter of You.  
  
33. The mind is like an impetuous horse that even persons who have  
regulated their senses and breath cannot control. Those in this world  
who try to tame the uncontrolled mind, but who abandon the feet of their  
spiritual master, encounter hundreds of obstacles in their cultivation  
of various distressful practices. O unborn Lord, they are like merchants  
on a boat in the ocean who have failed to employ a helmsman.  
  
34. To those persons who take shelter of You, You reveal Yourself as  
the Supersoul, the embodiment of all transcendental pleasure. What  
further use have such devotees for their servants, children or bodies,  
their wives, money or houses, their land, good health or conveyances? And  
for those who fail to appreciate the truth about You and go on pursuing  
the pleasures of sex, what could there be in this entire world—a place  
inherently doomed to destruction and devoid of significance—that could  
give them real happiness?  
  
35. Sages free from false pride live on this earth by frequenting the  
sacred pilgrimage sites and those places where the Supreme Lord displayed  
His pastimes. Because such devotees keep Your lotus feet within their  
hearts, the water that washes their feet destroys all sins. Anyone  
who even once turns his mind toward You, the ever-blissful Soul of all  
existence, no longer dedicates himself to serving family life at home,  
which simply robs a man of his good qualities.  
  
36. It may be proposed that this world is permanently real because it is  
generated from the permanent reality, but such an argument is subject  
to logical refutation. Sometimes, indeed, the apparent nondifference  
of a cause and its effect fails to prove true, and at other times the  
product of something real is illusory. Furthermore, this world cannot be  
permanently real, for it partakes of the natures of not only the absolute  
reality but also the illusion disguising that reality. Actually, the  
visible forms of this world are just an imaginary arrangement resorted  
to by a succession of ignorant persons in order to facilitate their  
material affairs. With their various meanings and implications, the  
learned words of Your Vedas bewilder all persons whose minds have been  
dulled by hearing the incantations of sacrificial rituals.  
  
37. Since this universe did not exist prior to its creation and will no  
longer exist after its annihilation, we conclude that in the interim  
it is nothing more than a manifestation imagined to be visible within  
You, whose spiritual enjoyment never changes. We liken this universe  
to the transformation of various material substances into diverse  
forms. Certainly those who believe that this figment of the imagination  
is substantially real are less intelligent.  
  
38. The illusory material nature attracts the minute living entity  
to embrace her, and as a result he assumes forms composed of her  
qualities. Subsequently, he loses all his spiritual qualities and must  
undergo repeated deaths. You, however, avoid the material energy in the  
same way that a snake abandons its old skin. Glorious in Your possession  
of eight mystic perfections, You enjoy unlimited opulences.  
  
39. Members of the renounced order who fail to uproot the last traces of  
material desire in their hearts remain impure, and thus You do not allow  
them to understand You. Although You are present within their hearts,  
for them You are like a jewel worn around the neck of a mall who has  
totally forgotten it is there. O Lord, those who pratice yoga only for  
sense gratification must suffer punishment both in this life and the next:    
from death, who will not release them, and from You, whose kingdom they  
cannot reach.  
  
40. When a person realizes You, he no longer cares about his good and  
bad fortune arising from past pious and sinful acts, since it is You  
alone who control this good and bad fortune. Such a realized devotee  
also disregards what ordinary living beings say about him. Every day  
he fills his ears with Your glories, which are recited in each age by  
the unbroken succession of Manu’s descendants, and thus You become his  
ultimate salvation.  
  
41. Because You are unlimited, neither the lords of heaven nor even You  
Yourself can ever reach the end of Your glories. The countless universes,  
each enveloped in its shell, are compelled by the wheel of time to  
wander within You, like particles of dust blowing about in the sky. The  
srutis, following their method of eliminating everything separate from  
the Supreme, become successful by revealing You as their final conclusion.
