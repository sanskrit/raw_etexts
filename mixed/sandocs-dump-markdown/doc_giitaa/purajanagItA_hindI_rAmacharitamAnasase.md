 पुरजनगीता रामचरितमानससे   
  
दोहा  
जीवनमुक्त ब्रह्मपर चरित सुनहिं तजि ध्यान ।  
जे हरि कथाँ न करहिं रति तिन्ह के हिय पाषान । ४२ ।   
  
Even those (like Sanaka and others) who are liberated though embodied and are  
absorbed in Brahma hear the narrative of Shri Rama even by interrupting their  
meditation (abstraction). Truly theirs must be a heart of stone, who take no  
delight in the stories of Shri Hari.  
  
  
चौपाई  
एक बार रघुनाथ बोलाए । गुर द्विज पुरबासी सब आए ।  
बैठे गुर मुनि अरु द्विज सज्जन । बोले बचन भगत भव भञ्जन । १ ।  
सुनहु सकल पुरजन मम बानी । कहउँ न कछु ममता उर आनी ।  
नहिं अनीति नहिं कछु प्रभुताई । सुनहु करहु जो तुम्हहि सोहाई । २ ।  
सोइ सेवक प्रियतम मम सोई । मम अनुसासन मानै जोई ।  
जौँ अनीति कछु भाषौँ भाई । तौ मोहि बरजहु भय बिसराई । ३ ।  
बड़ें भाग मानुष तनु पावा । सुर दुर्लभ सब ग्रन्थन्हि गावा ।  
साधन धाम मोच्छ कर द्वारा । पाइ न जेहिं परलोक सँवारा । ४ ।  
  
One day, invited by the Lord of the Raghus, the preceptor (vasiShTha) and other  
leading BrahmaNas and all the other citizens assembled (in the royal court).  
When the preceptor and the other sages and BrahmaNas as well as all other  
gentlemen had taken their seats, the Lord who puts an end to the round of births  
of His devotees, addressed them in the following words:- `Listen to My words,  
citizens all: I am not going to say anything out of attachment for you in My  
heart; I do not ask you to do any thing wrong nor do I make use of My authority.  
Therefore, listen to Me and act accordingly if you please. He is My servant and  
he is dearest to Me, who obeys My command. If I say anything which is wrong,  
brethren, be not afraid to correct Me. It is by good fortune that you have  
secured a human body, which-as declared by all the scriptures-is difficult even  
for the gods to attain. It is a tabernacle suitable for spiritual endeavours,  
gateway to liberation. He who fails to earn a good destiny hereafter even on  
attaining it --- (1-4)  
  
  
दोहा  
सो परत्र दुख पावइ सिर धुनि धुनि पछिताइ ।  
कालहि कर्महि ईस्वरहि मिथ्या दोष लगाइ । ४३ ।  
  
--- he reaps torture in the other world and beats his head in remorse, wrongly  
attributing the blame to Time, Fate and God.' (43)  
  
  
चौपाई  
एहि तन कर फल बिषय न भाई । स्वर्गउ स्वल्प अन्त दुखदाई ।  
नर तनु पाइ बिषयँ मन देहीं । पलटि सुधा ते सठ बिष लेहीं । १ ।  
ताहि कबहुँ भल कहई न कोई । गुञ्जा ग्रहै परस मनि खोई ।  
आकर चारि लच्छ चौरासी । जोनि भ्रमत यह जिव अबिनासी । २ ।  
फिरत सदा माया कर प्रेरा । काल कर्म सुभाव गुन घेरा ।  
कबहुँक करि करुना नर देही । देत ईस बिनु हेतु सनेही । ३ ।  
नर तनु भव बारिधि कहुँ बेरो । सन्मुख मरुत अनुग्रह मेरो ।  
करनधार सदगुर दृढ़ नावा । दुर्लभ साज सुलभ करि पावा । ४ ।  
  
`Sensuous enjoyment, brethren, is not the be-all and end-all of human existence;  
even heavenly enjoyment is short-lived and ends in sorrow. The fools who devote  
their mind to the pleasures of sense even after attaining human birth, take  
poison in exchange for nectar. None will ever speak well of him who picks up a  
peppercorn throwing away the philosopher's stone. This immortal soul goes round  
through eighty-four lakh species of life, falling under four broad divisions.  
Driven by Maya (My deluding potency) and encompassed by Time, destiny, Nature  
and phenomenal existence, it ever drifts along. Rarely does God, who loves the  
Jiva without any self-interest, graciously bestow on it a human form, which is  
a veritable raft whereby it can cross the ocean of mundane existence, with My  
grace for a favourable wind and a worthy preceptor for a helmsman to steer this  
strong bark - a combination which, though difficult to secure, has been made  
easily available to it.' (1-4)  
  
  
दोहा  
जो न तरै भव सागर नर समाज अस पाइ ।  
सो कृत निन्दक मन्दमति आत्माहन गति जाइ । ४४ ।  
  
`The man who, though equipped with all these resources, fails to cross the ocean  
of metempsychosis is ungrateful and dull-witted and meets the fate of a  
self-murderer.' (44)  
  
  
चौपाई  
जौँ परलोक इहाँ सुख चहहू । सुनि मम बचन हृदयँ दृढ़ गहहू ।  
सुलभ सुखद मारग यह भाई । भगति मोरि पुरान श्रुति गाई । १ ।  
ग्यान अगम प्रत्यूह अनेका । साधन कठिन न मन कहुँ टेका ।  
करत कष्ट बहु पावइ कोऊ । भक्ति हीन मोहि प्रिय नहिं सोऊ । २ ।  
भक्ति सुतन्त्र सकल सुख खानी । बिनु सतसङ्ग न पावहिं प्रानी ।  
पुन्य पुञ्ज बिनु मिलहिं न सन्ता । सतसङ्गति संसृति कर अन्ता । ३ ।  
पुन्य एक जग महुँ नहिं दूजा । मन क्रम बचन बिप्र पद पूजा ।  
सानुकूल तेहि पर मुनि देवा । जो तजि कपटु करइ द्विज सेवा । ४ ।  
  
`If you seek happiness here as well as hereafter, listen to My words and imprint  
them deeply in your heart. It is an easy and pleasant road, brethren, that of  
devotion to My feet, extolled in the PuraNas and Vedas. Gnosis is difficult to  
attain and beset with numerous obstacles. The path is rugged and there is no  
solid ground for the mind to rest on. Scarcely one attains it after a hard  
struggle; yet, lacking in Devotion, the man fails to win My love. Devotion is  
independent and a mine of all blessings; men, however, cannot attain it except  
through the fellowship of saints. Saints for their part are inaccessible without  
a stock of merit; communion with the Lord's devotees in any case brings to an  
end the cycle of births and deaths. There is only one meritorious act in this  
world and no other- to adore the feet of the BrahmaNas by thought, word and  
deed. The sages and gods are propitious to him who guilelessly serves the  
twice-born (the BrahmaNas).' (1-4)  
  
  
दोहा  
औरउ एक गुपुत मत सबहि कहउँ कर जोरि ।  
सङ्कर भजन बिना नर भगति न पावइ मोरि । ४५ ।  
  
`With joined palms I lay before you all, another secret doctrine: without  
adoring Shankara (Lord Shiva) man cannot attain devotion to Me.' (45)  
  
  
चौपाई  
कहहु भगति पथ कवन प्रयासा । जोग न मख जप तप उपवासा ।  
सरल सुभाव न मन कुटिलाई । जथा लाभ सन्तोष सदाई । १ ।  
मोर दास कहाइ नर आसा । करइ तौ कहहु कहा बिस्वासा ।  
बहुत कहउँ का कथा बढ़ाई । एहि आचरन बस्य मैं भाई । २ ।  
बैर न बिग्रह आस न त्रासा । सुखमय ताहि सदा सब आसा ।  
अनारम्भ अनिकेत अमानी । अनघ अरोष दच्छ बिग्यानी । ३ ।  
प्रीति सदा सज्जन संसर्गा । तृन सम बिषय स्वर्ग अपबर्गा ।  
भगति पच्छ हठ नहिं सठताई । दुष्ट तर्क सब दूरि बहाई । ४ ।  
  
`Tell Me what pains are involved in treading the path of Devotion : it requires  
neither Yoga (mind-control), nor sacrifices, nor Japa (muttering of prayers),  
nor penance, nor fasting. A guileless disposition, a mind free from perversity  
and absolute contentment with whatever may be got-this is all that is needed. If  
he who is called a devotee yet counts upon man, tell me, what faith does he have  
in Me? What use My dwelling on the subject further : I am won by the conduct of  
a man as depicted below, brethren. He who has no enmity or quarrel with anyone  
and is devoid of hope and fear-to such a man all the quarters are ever full of  
joy. Undertaking nothing (with an interested motive), without home, without  
pride and without sin, free from wrath, clever and wise, ever loving the company  
of saints and accounting the enjoyments even of heaven as well as final  
beatitude as no more than a blade of grass, tenaciously adhering to the cult of  
Devotion but avoiding bigotry, and giving up all sophistical reasoning' :- (1-4)  
  
  
दोहा  
मम गुन ग्राम नाम रत गत ममता मद मोह ।  
ता कर सुख सोइ जानइ परानन्द सन्दोह । ४६ ।  
  
`Fond of singing and hearing My praises and devoted to My Name, and free from  
attachment to the world, arrogance and infatuation-the felicity that such a man  
enjoys is known to him alone who has become one with God, the embodiment of  
supreme bliss.' (46)  
  
  
चौपाई  
सुनत सुधासम बचन राम के । गहे सबनि पद कृपाधाम के ।  
जननि जनक गुर बन्धु हमारे । कृपा निधान प्रान ते प्यारे । १ ।  
तनु धनु धाम राम हितकारी । सब बिधि तुम्ह प्रनतारति हारी ।  
असि सिख तुम्ह बिनु देइ न कोऊ । मातु पिता स्वारथ रत ओऊ । २ ।  
हेतु रहित जग जुग उपकारी । तुम्ह तुम्हार सेवक असुरारी ।  
स्वारथ मीत सकल जग माहीं । सपनेहुँ प्रभु परमारथ नाहीं । ३ ।  
सब के बचन प्रेम रस साने । सुनि रघुनाथ हृदयँ हरषाने ।  
निज निज गृह गए आयसु पाई । बरनत प्रभु बतकही सुहाई । ४ ।  
  
On hearing Shri Rama's nectar-like words all (who had assembled there) clasped  
the feet of the All-merciful. `Fountain of mercy ! You are our father and  
mother, preceptor and kinsman; You are dearer to us than our own life. Rama, You  
are our body, wealth and habitat and You are beneficent to us in everyway,  
relieving as You do the agony of the suppliant. None other than You could give  
such instruction; for even father and mother are devoted to their own interest.  
You two are the only disinterested benefactors in this world-Yourself and Your  
servant, O Destroyer of the demons. Everyone else in this world has his own  
interest to serve; no one thinks of others' highest (spiritual) interests even  
in a dream, O Lord.' The Lord of the Raghus was delighted at heart to hear the  
words of all, steeped as those wrrds were in the nectar of love. On receiving  
the Lord's permission they returned each to his own residence, repeating on the  
way the Lord's charming discourse. (1-4)  
  
  
दोहा  
उमा अवधबासी नर नारि कृतारथ रूप ।  
ब्रह्म सच्चिदानन्द घन रघुनायक जहँ भूप । ४७ ।  
  
Uma, (continues Lord Shiva,) the people of Ayodhya, both men and women, were the  
very picture of blessedness : for the Lord of the Raghus, who was none other  
than Brahma, the embodiment of truth, intelligence and bliss, ruled there as  
king. (47)
