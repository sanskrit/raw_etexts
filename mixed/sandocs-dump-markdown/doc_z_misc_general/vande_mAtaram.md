 Translation of Vande Mataram by Shri Aurobindo Ghose  
According to Bhavan's book, Vande Mataram by Moni Bagchee, (pg. 66),  
``Bankin Chandra composed the song in an inspired moment,  
Rabindranath sang it by setting a tune to it and it was left to the  
genius of Aurobindo to interpret the deeper meaning of the song  
out of which India received the philosophy of new Nationalism.''  
Shri Aurobindo's birthday was also on 15th of August.  
  
          Mother, I bow to thee!  
          Rich with thy hurrying streams,  
          bright with orchard gleams,  
          Cool with thy winds of delight,  
          Dark fields waving Mother of might,  
          Mother free.  
          Glory of moonlight dreams,  
          Over thy branches and lordly streams,  
          Clad in thy blossoming trees,  
          Mother, giver of ease  
          Laughing low and sweet!  
          Mother I kiss thy feet,  
          Speaker sweet and low!  
          Mother, to thee I bow.  
          Who hath said thou art weak in thy lands,  
          When the sword flesh out in the seventy million hands  
          And seventy million voices roar  
          Thy dreadful name from shore to shore?  
          With many strengths who art mighty and stored,  
          To thee I call Mother and Lord!  
          Though who savest, arise and save!  
          To her I cry who ever her foeman drove  
          Back from plain and Sea  
          And shook herself free.  
          Thou art wisdom, thou art law,  
          Thou art heart, our soul, our breath  
          Though art love divine, the awe  
          In our hearts that conquers death.  
          Thine the strength that nervs the arm,  
          Thine the beauty, thine the charm.  
          Every image made divine  
          In our temples is but thine.  
          Thou art Durga, Lady and Queen,  
          With her hands that strike and her  
          swords of sheen,  
          Thou art LakShmi lotus-throned,  
          And the Muse a hundred-toned,  
          Pure and perfect without peer,  
          Mother lend thine ear,  
          Rich with thy hurrying streams,  
          Bright with thy orchard gleems,  
          Dark of hue O candid-fair  
          In thy soul, with jewelled hair  
          And thy glorious smile divine,  
          Loveliest of all earthly lands,  
          Showering wealth from well-stored hands!  
          Mother, mother  mine!  
          Mother sweet, I bow to thee,  
          Mother great and free!

Excerpts from ``Story of a Song: Ecstacy and Agony'' by Shivaramu  
           Part 1  
          GENESIS OF JANAGANAMANA:    
  W.B. Yeats is a great Irish poet. He was a friend of Tagore's, and a great  
admirer of his works. He wrote a beautiful introduction to Tagore's Gitanjali.  
Once an Indian disciple of Tagore met Yeats. In a letter to Lady Gregory in  
America, Yeats mentioned that he had told him that Sarojini Naidu's brother  
was unhappy that Tagore wrote a poem welcoming King George V. He also narrated  
to her an appetising story he had from the disciple warning her that it was  
strictly off the record. It concerns the circumstances in which Janaganamana  
was composed: ``The National Congress people asked Tagore for a poem of welcome.  
He tried to write it, but could not. He got up very early in the morning and  
wrote a very beautiful poem, not one of his best, but still beautiful. When he  
came down, he said to one of us, `Here is a poem which I have written. It is  
addressed to God, but give it to Congress people. It will please them. They  
will think it is addressed to the King.' All Tagore's own followers knew it  
meant God, but others did not.'' (The Indian Express, June 3, 1968)  
    The Calcutta Congress session began on December 26, 1911- The proceedings  
on the first day began with Vandemataram. The second day was entirely devoted  
to things connected with the welcoming of King George V, and this day the song  
Janaganamana was sung, and at the closing ceremony Rajbhuja Dutt Choudhary's  
'Badshah Hamara' was sung. On the third day Saraladevi sang her own composition  
'Namo Hindustan'.  
   The news papers reports had the following comments on Janaganaman:    
   ``The Bengali poet Babu Rabindranath Tagore sang a song composed by him  
specially to welcome the Emperor.'' (Statesman, Dec.28, 1911)  
   ``The proceedings began with the singing by Babu Rabindranath Tagore of a  
song specially composed by him in honour of the Emperor.'' (Englishman, Dec.28).  
   ``When the proceedings of the Indian National Congress began on Wednesday  
27th December 1911, a Bengali song in welcome of the Emperor was sung. A  
resolution welcoming the Emperor and Empress was also adopted unanomously.''  
    (Indian, Dec. 29, 1911)  
  In the eyes of many leaders of the day, loyalty to the nation and loyalty  
to the Emperor were identical. King George V had proclaimed on Dec.12 the  
annulment of the partition of Bengal. There was therefore nothing unnatural  
or extraordinary in a Bengali poet, Rabindranath Tagore, composing or singing  
a song in praise of the Emperor out of gratitude. But differences of opinion  
were bound to arise when the question of its adoption as the national anthem  
came up. The choice of a national anthem should undoubtedly be one which can  
be a fountain of inspiration by the sanctity of its origin.  
   Rabindranath Tagore did not contradict newspaper reports which characterised  
Janaganamana as a song composed in honour of King George V. Gradually the tide  
of nationalism began to affect the old values. Loyalty to the country and  
loyalty to the King became irreconcilable. Honour, devotion and love of the  
country not only ceased to co-exist with honour, devotion and love of King  
Emperor, but mutually antagonistic.  
  Also the British government which was charging people with sedition for  
singing Vande Mataram extended high regard to Janaganamana. It was sung in  
Government schools, and in scout groups which fostered loyalty to the British  
throne. At the time British quit India, a fighter plane was presented by  
England to India, and on this occasion Janaganamana was sung. The British  
also praised the song. It is anybody's guess as to why they praised it?  
          ACCEPTENCE AS NATIONAL ANTHEM  
  January 26, 1950 was set for the Indian Republic. The national anthem was  
to be chosen before the election of the President. The objection advanced  
Vandemataram was that unlike Janaganamana it did not suit band music, but  
Master Krishna Rao had solved the difficulty. He had given a demonstration  
before the members of the Constituent Assembly who had to decide the issue.  
Moreover, there was generous appreciation from experts in Bombay, both official  
and professional. It was therefore expected, that unless the technical objec-  
tion was a mere facade, the Constituent Assembly would adopt Vande Mataram  
as the national anthem. The Government's objections having been disproved,  
the nation heaved a sigh of relief.  
    Mahatma Gandhi wanted Vande Mataram to be our national anthem. The song  
was invariably sung at his prayer meetings. After Vande Matram was sung on  
August 29, 1947, Gandhi ji said, ``Vande Matram should be set to music so that  
millions can sing it together, and feel the thrill. They should all sing in  
the same raga, with the same bhava. Shantiniketan or some other competent  
institution should design an acceptable raga.'' This wish of Gandhi ji was  
fulfilled through Master Krishni Rao's craftmanship.  
   After this time, the whole of Bengal, under the leadership of its Premier  
Dr B. C. Roy, took up the campaign in favour of Vande Mataram.  
   In view of this background, the possibility of the members of the Constit-  
uent Assembly, inspired by sentiments of patriotism, adopting Vande Mataram  
as the national anthem was indeed strong. But things were happening behind the  
scene.  
  
  
  
           Part 2  
          AND THE CONTROVERSY STARTED  
   Pt. Vishnu Digambar Paluskar founded the Gandharva Mahavidhyalaya. A well-  
known musician, he was also a proud patriot. He brought into vogue the tradi-  
tion of singing national songs at public functions. In the dawn of the  
Swedeshi movement, he started the tradition of singing Vande Mataram in Lahore,  
and carried it to different parts of the country. He commanded not only  
immense scholarship, but a magnetic personality and a wonderful voice. He was  
regarded with great respect by the national leaders of the freedom movement.  
It was their desire that he should sing Vande Mataram at the commencement of  
every Congress session. Paluskar attended Congress session, year after year,  
since 1915, and his performance captured the hearts of delegates.  
    In 1923 the Congress session was held at Kakinada, which is now in Andhra  
Pradesh. As usual Paluskar was invited to it. He rose to sing Vande Mataram.  
Maulana Mohamed Ali was the President of the Congress that year.  
   ``When Vishnu Digambar rose to sing Vande Mataram in conformity with  
tradition, Maulana Saheb raised an objection on the ground that music was  
taboo to his religion. The leaders assembled were completely bewildered. Vishnu  
Digambar was incensed, and hit back: `This is a national forum, not the  
plateform of any single community. This is no mosque to object to music. There  
is no justification for a ban on music here. When the President could put up  
with the music in the presidential procession, why does he object to it here?'  
Having silenced the President, without waiting for his reply, he proceeded to  
sing Vande Mataram and completed it. Respect for his sense of national pride  
and love of the motherland grew. The people admired his moral courage, and  
applauded him heartily.'' (Vishnu Digambar Paluskar, National Book Trust, p.54)  
    It came as a great shock to the people that Maulana Md. Ali should object  
the singing of Vande Mataram. There was no doubt that this was an indication  
of a mentality of separatism which refused to identify itself with the main-  
stream of national life. But this episode did little damage either to the  
greatness or the popularity of the song. Mahatma Gandhi repeatedly referred  
to the virtues of this national anthem. ``When we sing that ode to the mother-  
land, Bande Mataram, we sing it to the whole of India.'' (Kesari January 1924)  
    The opposition of Muslim League to Vande Mataram, however, continued to  
wax and they started putting pressure on Congress leadership against the sing-  
ing of this song. It was the height of irony on the part of the Muslim League,  
which was bent upon breaking the unity of India, emotionally, geographically,  
and in all other ways, to express its concern about `the growth of genuine  
natinalism'. Those in Congress who were eager to pander to every slightest  
wish of the League were agitated, and a feeling developed that unless ML is  
dissatisfied and it was won over the unity of the country would be imperilled.  
In such a situation CWC in 1937 decided to maim and curtail the national song.  
   The CWC appointed a sub-committee with Maulana Azad, Nehru, Subhash Chandra  
Bose and Acharya Narendra Dev as members to review the eligibility of VM to  
the status of national anthem. The committee was to take the guidance of  
Rabindranath Tagore. And this sub-committee endorsed the CWC's resolution  
to adopt VM in its truncated form as the national anthem:    
   ``Anandmath was the story of a heroic struggle against foreign rule. Because  
it happened to be a Muslim rule, a fresh objection was raised. Bankim's  
object was to arouse through his novels a patriotic awakening among the people  
so that they became consious of their slavery under the British. He couldn't  
do it overtly, but his fiction achieved the purpose. The revolutinaries of  
Bengal accepted it in this spirit in the early part of the century; it bacame  
the mantra of those who mounted the gallows in a bid to emanicipate the country  
from  alien bondage ...The Congress, however, in order to conciliate the Muslims,  
mutilated the song and ordered that only first two stanzas of it should be  
sung.'' (Muslim Politics, S. Mukherjee, p.53)  
    But Muslim League continued its campaign to dethrone even the first two  
stanzas of the VM. In the lagislative assemblies they would boycott the singing  
of the song or raise point of orders or bring adjournment motions etc. and  
would make a plea that `singing of VM is a declaration of war on Islam.' To  
appease them in Madras assembly from January 28, 1938, the practice of reciting  
from  the Qiran and a prayer in English was also introduced. But ML was not  
satisfied, it continued to demand the deletion of VM from national movement,  
and to this effect it passed a resolution (Pirpur Report, Nov.15, 1938) which  
listed numerous grievences of the Muslims, VM song had topped the list.  
  
  
  
           Part 3  
          AFTER INDEPENDENCE,  
                 THE CONTOVERSY CONTINUED  
    In GOI's publication (Our National Songs), it is said that experts were  
of the view that Vande Mataram lacked rhythm and movement. Of course they were  
official experts, and remain unidentified. In their opinion the essential  
qualification of a national anthem is `tal' (beat) and hence recommeded  
Janaganamana.  
   Mahatama Gandhi called Janaganamana a religious hymn, not the national  
anthem, but he characterised numerous times Vandemataram as the national  
anthem.  
   About Janaganamana, Humayun Kabir agrees with the view expressed by  
Gandhiji. ``In a sense it is more a religious hymn for all mankind than a  
national anthem for any country.'' (Rabindaranath Tagore, a Centenary Vol.p.152)  
   And let us see what are the sentiments expressed by many about VM:    
 Vandemataram was an expression of nationalism, its very soul, and therefore  
the natinal anthem. It quickly spread throughout India, and was on the lips of  
millions as the national anthem. (Maharishi Aurobind in `Mahayogi' p.47)  
  ``The greatest and most enduring gift of the swedeshi movement was Vande  
Mataram, the uncrowned national anthem.'' (The Cambridge History of India,  
Vol.IV, p.608)  
   ``Bankim Chandra Chatterjee's poem Vande Mataram first appeared in his  
novel Anandamath in 1882, and soon became the Merseillaise of the nationalist  
movement throughout India.'' (A Book of India, B.N. Pande, p.67)  
   ``Bande Mataram: A song which occurs in Bankim Chatterjee's novel. The song  
was quite popular during nationalist agitations in the early part of this  
century in Bengal. Subsequently it became a kind of unofficial national  
anthem.'' (Nehru, The first sixty years, Vol.II, p.577)  
   ``Vandemataram, which at the beginning of the 20th century became the anthem  
of the Indian nationalist movement, is the motherland personified.'' (Tilak and  
the Struggle for Indian Freedom, p.253)  
   ``Vande Mataram! These are the magic words which will open the door of his  
iron safe, break through the walls of his strong room, and confound the hearts  
of those who are disloyal to its call to say Vande Mataram.'' (Rabindranath  
Tagore in Glorious Thoughts of Tagore, p.165)  
   Therefore, it was the natural expectation that this great national anthem  
would continue as the official national anthem of India. It was used in the  
Constituent assembly, and was sung by Smt. Sucheta Kriplani. But soon a dis-  
cordant note began to be heard. Much to the surprise of its own members, the  
Constituent assembly deferred the question of adopting the national anthem  
again and again. Who were behind the controversy and what were their motives?  
The following excerpt from Pt. Nehru's statement on this issue may provide  
some clue:    
  ``It is unfortunate that some kind of argument has arisen between VM and Jana.  
VM is obviously and indisputedly the premier national song of India, with a  
great historical tradition and intimately connected with our struggle for  
freedom. That position it is bound to retain and no other song can displace  
it. It represents the passion and poignancy of that struggle but perhaps not  
so much the culmination of it. In regard to the national anthem tune, it was  
felt that the tune was more important than the words, and this tune should be  
such as to represent the Indian musical genius as well as to some extent the  
Western, so that it might easily be adapted to orchestra and band music, and  
to playing abroad. The real significance of the national anthem is perhaps  
more abroad than in the home country. Past experience has shown that Janagana  
tune has been greatly appreciated and admired abroad ...VM with all its very  
great attraction and historical background, was not easily suitable for  
orchastras in foreign countries .. It seemed therefore that while VM should  
continue to be the national song par excellence in India, the national anthem  
tune should be that of Janaganamana, and the wording of Janagana be altered  
suitably to fit in with existing circumstances.'' (Glorious Thoughts of Nehru,  
p.139)  
   The above rational and criteria for selecting a national anthem coming from  
the PM, had shocked the people of India. These ideas of Nehru's were severly  
criticised in the press and in other forums universally. The gallup polls  
conducted by some organizations on this issue showed that 95% people favored  
VM as the national anthem.  
   ``When the objection was raised to the adoption of VM as the national  
anthem on the ground that it was full of idolatry, Aurobindo said Durga to  
whom it paid homage was none other than Bharata Mata symbolising Knowledge,  
Power, Greatness and Glory.'' (Resurgent India, p.191)  
   The charge that VM cannot be set to the tune to suit band and foreign  
orchestra was disproved when it was set to melodious tune by an ace musician  
Master Krishna Rao, but Nehru ji did not budge. And Dr Rajendra Prasad who  
was presiding the Constituent assembly on 24 January 1950 made the following  
statement which also became the final decision on this issue:    
   ``The composition consisting of words and music known as Janaganamana is  
the National Anthem of India, subject to such alterations as the Government  
may authorise as occasion arises, and the song Vande Mataram, which has played  
a historic part in the struggle for Indian freedom, shall be honored equally  
with Janaganamana and shall have equal status with it. (Applause) I hope this  
will satify members.'' (Constituent Assembly of India, Vil.XII, 24-1-1950)  
  
  
  
           Part 4  
          HOW WAS THE SONG COMPOSED?  
   It is true that Vande Mataram blossomed forth in Anandamath, but it is  
even more true that it was Bankim's intention that it should blossom forth  
beyond Anandamath. For Vande Mataram, the song, was composed before  
Anandamath was written.  
  How Bankim saw the wonderful vision that worked as a most powerful spiri-  
tual lever in the movement for his country's liberation, how he immortalised  
that vision in the hymn are not fully known. But this much is known that one  
auspicious moment arrived, in 1875, when Bankim took a holiday to escape from  
the hectic life of Calcutta. He boarded a train bound for his native town  
Kantalapada. As the city left behind, there was greenry all around and his  
heart filled with joy. The contemplation of the motherland with her rich  
rivers, flowers, fruits and forests sent a pulsating current through Bankim.  
In that instant the sod was turned into divinity by magic. His eyes and ears  
became alert, hungry. His inner eye beheld the motherland in all her rich  
variety and beauty; his inner ear listened to voices from the earth, the air  
and the sky. And Nature begot her song! She gave it to benevolent Bankim! He  
bowed and received the gift. And then he reduced it to writing, as one who  
saw and heard the whole of it.  
    Vande Mataram!  
Those lakes, and rivers, the sacred Ganga, Jamuna, Godavari, Saraswati,  
Narmada, Sindhu, Kaveri; and those groves laden with fruits of many kinds,  
a very paradise on earth; and the soft breeze which gently kisses as it  
passes by; and the endless greenry ....  
  
    Sujalam suphalam  
    Malayaja sheetalam  
    Sasya shyamalam  
    Mataram!  
And the land bathed in moonlight, trees and creepers gay with tender leaves  
and flowers, the sweet smile and melodious voice .....  
  
    Shubhra jyotsna pulakitayamineem  
    Phullakusumita drumadala shobhineem  
    Suhasineem sumadhura bhashineem  
    Sukhadam, varadam Mataram!  
And the leonine roar that issues from multi-million throats; the blinding  
flash of millions of swords leaping up in an instant; and the spectacle of  
unfettered strength triumphantly trampling the enemy under its elephantine  
foot ....  
  
    Koti koti kantha kalakala ninadakarale  
    Koti koti bhujairdhrutakharakaravale  
    Ke bale ma tumi abale  
    Bahubala dharineem  
    Namami tarineem  
    Ripudala varineem  
    Mataram!  
The ancient land of giver of the Vedas, and those centers of devotion,  
power and knowledge ....  
  
    Tumi vidhya tumi dharma  
    Tumi hridi tumi marma  
    Twam hi pranah shareere  
    Bahute tumi ma shakti  
    Hridaye tumi ma bhakti  
    Tomarayi pratima gadi  
    Mandire mandire!  
Jaya Durgi ....Sri LakShmi ....Sri Saraswati ... motherland! the Goddess incarnate  
    Twam hi Durga dashapraharana dharinee  
    Kamala kamaladala viharinee  
    Vani vidyadayinee  
         Namami twam  
         Namami kamalam  
         Amalam atulam  
         Sujalam suphalam  
         Mataram  
         Vande Mataram!  
The one evergreen, ever new, and endowed with riches of many kinds ....  
  
    Shyamalam saralam  
    Susmitam bhushitam  
    Dharaneem bharaneem  
    Mataram!  
        The song was born, Bankim put the infant in the cradle of  
Anandamath. He knew the great promise of the infant. The prophet was aware  
of the historic role it would play in times to come.  
  
  
  
             Part 5  
          HOW THE SONG VANDEMATARAM GETS  
          INCORPORATED IN THE ANANDAMATH?  
 At the beginning of this novel:    
A human voice breaks the midnight silence of a dark, dense forest:    
``Will not my desire be fulfilled?''  
``What price are you prepared to pay for it?'' The counter-question was the  
answer.  
``My life, and all that is mine.''  
``Your life is not of much moment; anyone can sacrifice it.''  
``What else can I offer? Name the price.''  
``Devotion!''  
  Holding life cheap, banishing the fear of death, devotion illumines the  
frontiers of the human mind in a sudden upsurge. The center of such devo-  
tion is Mother, the symbol of the Motherland! That was the premises on which  
the song Vandemataram gets incorporated in the novel.  
   A description of this Motherland occurs in Chapter 10:    
Bhavananda is in a different mood. He is no more a sanaysin, bold and infle-  
xible. He is no more the ruthless general of the army. He isn't the arrogant  
man who a moment ago had humbled Mahendra. Amid the beauty of the land and  
water bathed in moonlight, his mind dances like an ocean in tide at the sight  
of the moon. Bhavananda turns gay and eager for friendly conversation. He is  
eager to talk. He makes many attempts to talk, but Mahendra does not respond.  
And then Bhavananda begins to sing for himself:    
    Vande Mataram  
    Sujalam Suphalam  
    Malayaja Sheetalam  
    Mataram!  
He sings with all his heart and soul, with great devotion, and his masculine  
voice, so pleasing to the ear, echoes and re-echoes, and filling the whole  
horizon with its resonance, creates an indescribable atmosphere...  
  
Mahendra hears the song and is amazed. He cannot understand it. He asks who  
is the Mother, fed by rivers, fruit-bearing treas and fanned by the cool  
breeze of the mountains.  
Bhavananda does not seem to pay attention to the question. He is immersed in  
the song. Without pausing to answer him, he continues:    
   Shubhrajyotsna pulakitayamineem  
   Phullakusumita drumadala shobhineem  
   .....  
  
   .....  
  
Mahendra at first thinks that it may be an invocation to Durga. And then he  
feels it could not be. It is a description of the country, not of the  
Goddess Durga. At that point Bhavananda wants to speak. The meaning of the  
song, and the way of his life, were not different. He explains it: ``We do  
not accept any other Mother. Jananee Janambhoomishcha swargadapi gariyasi.  
The motherland is our Mother; apart from her we have no mother, father,  
brothers, wife or children, home of personal life; sujala, suphala, malayaja  
sheetalam, that is all we have.''  
And then Mahendra understands the import of the song. He asks Bhavananda to  
continue the song. And as he sings tears roll down his cheeks...  
  
And a new inspiration overcomes him. And now he is new person!  
This is how other characters of the story get inspired and united. The  
sublime characters which take part in the great story of Anandmath and grow up  
in elevating atmosphere display not only patriotism of a high order, but also  
the terrific strength of the sinews. They are living sparks which in the face  
of humiliation, burst into flames. They carry their love of the motherland into  
action. Koti koti kantha kalakala ninada karale! Koti koti bhujairdhruta  
kharakaravale! These lines are then witnessed in earth-shaking events.  
Individuals are mere tools.  
   The saga of the struggle and sacrifices of the heroes and martyres of  
freedom is nothing but a manifestation of the unconquerable will of the  
great Mother who inspired the saint and prophet Bankim to write Anandamath  
and give unto us Vande Mataram, the hymn of Liberty!
