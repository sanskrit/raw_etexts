%ASAD[2]  
  
किमपि शुभकार्यं गणेशवन्दनेन अथ वा सरस्वती वन्दनेन प्रारभ्यते ।  
अतः एषः द्वितीयः श्लोकः सरस्वतिवन्दनाय समर्पयामि  
  
Any good endeavour is begun be a prayer to Ganesh or Saraswati. Hence this  
second subhhAshita of ASAD' is dedicated to Saraswati :    
  
या कुन्देन्दुतुशारहारधवला या शुभ्रवस्त्रावृता  
या वीणावरदण्डमण्डितकरा या श्वेतपद्मासना ।  
या ब्रह्माच्युतशन्करप्रभृतिभिः देवैः सदा वन्दिता  
सा मां पातु सरस्वती भगवती निःशेषजाड्यापहा ॥  
  
  
One who is as white as a garland of kunda flowers and waterdrops, who has worn  
white apparel, whose hand is placed on the stem of the vINA, who is sitting on a  
white lotus, and who is always worshipped by Gods such as Brahma, Achyuta  
(Vishnu) and Shankara, that Sarasvati, who completely steals (one's) lethargy  
may bless me ...  
  
  
%ASAD[3]  
  
तृतीये अस्मिन् श्लोके गर्दभात् त्रीणि शिक्षेत  
  
In this third verse of ASAD, learn three things from the donkey...  
  
  
अविश्रामं वहेद्भारं शीतोष्णं च न विन्दति ।  
ससन्तोषस्तथा नित्यं त्रीणि शिक्षेत गर्दभात् ॥  
  
  
(He) carries loads without rest, is not deterred by the heat or cold, is always  
content   these three things should be learnt from the donkey  
  
%ASAD[5]  
  
एतस्मिन् सुभाशितं भवति शङ्करस्तवनाय । सुष्ठु कृतः खलु  
शब्दप्रयोगः अस्मिन् । पठतु  
  
This subhAshita is a prayer to Shankara. It has a nice verbal composition  
  
पिनाक फणि बालेन्दु भस्म मन्दाकिनी युता ।  
प वर्ग रचिता मूर्तिः अपवर्ग प्रडास्तु नः ॥  
  
  
Equipped with a spear(pinAka), snake(phaNi), the crescent of the  
moon(bAlendu), ashes and the ganga, may this idol composed from the  
'pa varga' (the consonants pa, pha, ba, bha, ma) lead us to heaven  
(apavarga).  
  
%ASAD[6]  
  
अस्ति एषा  सम्स्यापुर्तिः  
  
(here is a riddle   )  
  
पानियं पातुमिच्छामि त्वत्तः कमललोचने ।  
यदि दास्यसि नेच्छामि न दास्यसि पिबाम्यहम् ॥  
  
  
The apparent meaning : O Lotus eyed, I wish to drink water from you. If you  
give it to me, I do not want it, but if you dont give it, I shall drink  
it !!! (which obviously makes no sense..) The solution : the trick is in  
the word ᳚dAsyasi᳚ which has been interpreted above as the future tense form  
of the verb 'dA' meaning to give. However it is correctly interpreted as  
the sandhi dAsi + asi Hence the second line actually means, if you are a  
dAsi, I dont want it, but if you are not a dAsi I shall drink it. Perhaps  
this goes back to the times where braAhmins would note accept even water  
if it was touched by untouchable dAsis..  
  
  
%ASAD[7]  
  
भवन्ति बहवः श्लोकाः सज्जनसङ्गतिप्रशंसिनः । तस्मिनेतत्तु  
मह्यम् सर्वेभ्योऽधिकं प्रियम् ॥  
  
  
(There are many verses that praise the effects of good company. However  
this is my favourite among them  )  
  
सन्तप्तायसि संस्थितस्य पयसो नामापि न ज्ञायते  
मुक्ताकारतया तदेव नलिनीपत्रस्थितं राजते ।  
स्वात्यां सागरशुक्तिमध्यपतितं सन्मौक्तिकं जायते  
प्रायेणोत्तममध्यमाधमदशा संसर्गतो जायते ॥  
  
  
You cant even notice a hint of a drop of water fallen on hot iron. The     same  
drop shines like a pearl on a lotus leaf. And in the  
'swati' nakShatra fallen inside a sea shell, it becomes a pearl .. Usually  
excellent, medium and bad states (of a person) are dependent on company.  
Again as Marathi speaking people will recognise, this is exactly identical  
to the following marathi verse :    
  
तोयाचे परि नाव ही न उरते सन्तप्त लोहावरी  
ते भासे नलिनीदलावरि अह ! सन्मौक्तिकाचे परि ।  
ते स्वातीस्तव अब्धिशुक्तिपुटकि मोती घडे नेतके  
जाणा उत्तममध्यमाधमदशा संसर्गयोगे टिके  ॥  
  
  
  
%ASAD[8]  
  
विद्यां प्रशंसिनं एनं श्लोकं मन्ये बहवो जानन्ति ।  
  
(I think many people know this verse that praises knowledge)  
  
न चोरहार्यं न च राजहार्यं न भ्रातृभाज्यम् न च भारकारी ।  
व्यये कृते वर्धत एव नित्यं विद्याधनं सर्वधनप्रधानम् ॥  
  
  
It cannot be stolen by thieves, cannot be taken away by the king, cannot     be  
divided among brothers and does not cause a load. If spent, it always  
multiplies. The wealth of knowledge is the greatest among all wealths.  
  
%ASAD[8 1]  
  
परस्परविरोधे च वयं पञ्च च ते शतं   ।  
अन्यैः साकं विरोधे तु वयं पञ्चाधिकं शतम् ॥  
  
  
When in combat against each other we are 5 and they are hundred. But when  
against others, we are a hundred and five ...  
  
(obviously refers to Kauravas and Pandavas. I believe this is supposed to    be  
said by Dharma.)  
  
%ASAD[9]  
  
अजरामरवत्प्राज्ञो विद्यामर्थं च साधयेत् ।  
गृहीत इव केशेषु मृत्युना धर्ममाचरेत् ॥  
  
  
The wise man acquires knowldge and wealth as if he is never going to die.    And  
he practices relegion as if he is tightly held in his hair by death.  
  
%ASAD[10]  
  
अधिकमेकं मन्ये कालिदसेन रचितं  
  
Here's another one I believe accredited to Kalidasa  
  
कमले कमलोत्पत्तिः श्रूयते न तु दृश्यते ।  
बाले तव मुखाम्भोजे कथमिन्दीवरद्वयम् ॥  
  
  
The birth of one lotus on another has neither been seen nor heard of.    Little  
girl, how is it that on your lotus face there are these two    lotuses ? (her  
eyes)  
  
%ASAD[10 1]  
One more subhashitam that starts with ᳚kamale᳚  
  
कमले कमला शेते हरषेते हिमालये ।  
क्षिराब्धौ च हरिषेते मन्ये मत्कुण शन्कय। ॥  
  
  
On the lotus sits Goddess KamalA (LakShmi), Hara (Lord Shiva) resides in the  
HimAlayAs. In the vortex of the churning ocean resides Hari (Lord VishNu), I  
know this precisely.  
  कमलासन   =  Brahma (seated on a lotus)  
  कमलेक्षण  =  Vishnu (lotus eyed)  
  कमलारिकिरीट  =  Shiva? (crowned by the enemy of the lotus (moon?))  
  कमलबृत्       =  the sun (lit. husband of the lotus)  
  नुत              =  praised  
  स्तुत             =  praised ?  
May Laxmi, whose lotus like feet are praised by the trinity and the  
sun(?) make me her lotus (ie, abode)  
your interpretation of kamalArikirITa is perfect. the moon is the enemy of  
the lotus because when the moon rises, the lotus closes itself.  
  
कमल्भृद्वाह :    
  
 भृद्  = =  to carry;  
 वाह  = = carrier  
hence kamalabhRidvAha is the carrier of the carrier of a lotus, which is    the  
cloud   or the lord varuna.  
there is no special reason for using both stuta and nuta .. stuta means  
praised, and nuta means saluted..  
  
however, the best part is ᳚karotu me kamalaM᳚  
the word ka has many meanings. one among them is ᳚evil᳚. ᳚alaM᳚ means  
enough. Hence karotu me kaM alaM means may she end all my evil ...  
  
  
%ASAD[11]  
  
आकाशात् पतितं तोयं यथा गच्छति सागरम् ।  
सर्वदेवनमस्कारः केशवं प्रतिगच्छति ॥  
  
  
As all the water fallen from the skies goes to the sea, similarly  
salutations to any God finally reach Keshava.  
  
%ASAD[12]  
  
चिन्तनीया हि विपदामादावेव प्रतिक्रिया ।  
न कूपखनन्ं युक्तं प्रदीप्ते वह्निना गृहे ॥  
  
  
Reactions to calamities should be considered well in advance.  
It is no good to start digging a well when the house is on fire !  
  
%ASAD[11 1]  
  
यत्कोकिलः किलमधौ मधुरम् विरोति ।  
तच्चारु चाम्र कलिका णिक्रैक् हेतुः ।  
  
 किल  =  really  
 मधु  =  spring  
 मधुर  =  sweet  
 विरोत्ति  = it should actually be virauti : means cries.  
 चारु  =  beautiful  
 चाम्र  =  cha + Amra (Amra = mango)  
 कलिका  =  petal  
 णिक्रैक  =  ??? (is this correctly transliterated ?)  
 हेतुः  =  intention  
overall meaning : the sweet crying of the cuckoo in spring has the intention of  
the ᳚nikraika᳚ of the beautiful mango petal ..  
  
This shloka was poorly transliterated.. please refer the following  
transliteration guidelines when transliterating sanskrit into English. This will  
result in others understanding your shlokas more easily .. and hence responding  
quicker...  
  
  
%ASAD[13]  
  
क्षमा शस्त्रं करे यस्य दुर्जनः किं करिष्यति ।  
अतृणे पतितो वह्निः स्वयमेवोपशाम्यति ॥  
  
  
What can a wicked person do to someone who has the weapon of fogivance in his  
hands ? Fire fallen on ground without any grass extinguishes by itself.  
  
क्षमा बलमशक्तानाम् शक्तानाम् भूशणम् क्षमा ।  
क्षमा वशिक्रुते लोके क्षमया: किम् न सिध्यति । ॥  
  
  
forgivance is the strength of the weak. forgivance is the ornament of the  
mighty. if the  world is conquered by forgivance, what cannot be    accomplished  
by forgivance ?  
  
%ASAD[13 1]  
  
क्षमा बलमशक्तानाम् शक्तानाम् भूशणम् क्षमा।  
क्षमा वशिक्रुते लोके क्षमया: किम् न सिध्यति । ॥  
  
  
forgivance is the strength of the weak. forgivance is the ornament of the  
mighty. if the  world is conquered by forgivance, what cannot be  
accomplished by forgivance ?  
wrong in the first half of second line of the above verse itself !  
Even to get the meaning ᳚In the world, forgivance has the power of conquering᳚,  
the words look odd ... Does ᳚vashikrute᳚ give this meaning ?  
     वश  =  conquered. vashI+kRi = to conquer  
     वशीकृत  =  conquered.  
kShamAvashIkRite loke is a ᳚sati saptami᳚ usage. it is to be interpreted    as  
yadA lokaH kShamAvashIkRitaH tada  (when the world is conquered by  
forgivance) In the sati saptami usage, the saptami vibhaki is used to    denote  
the temporal relationship between two successive events    so basically it  
means, even when the world can be conquered by forgivance,    what else remains  
??  
  
%ASAD[14]  
  
कराग्रे वसते लक्ष्मीः करमध्ये सरस्वती ।  
करमूले तु गोविन्दः प्रभाते करदर्शनम् ॥  
  
  
Laxmi resides at the tip of the hand, sarasvati in the middle,  Govinda at the  
root. Hence one should take ᳚darshan᳚ of one's hand in the morning.  
  
कराग्रे वसते लक्ष्मीः करमध्ये सरस्वती ।  
करमूले तु गोविन्दः प्रभाते करदर्शनम् ॥  
  
  
If I rememeber the sloka it is ᳚karamule tu gouricha᳚ it's not govondaH.  
Laxmi resides at the tip of the hand, sarasvati in the middle,  Gouri(Parvati)  
at the root. Hence one should take ᳚darshan᳚ of one's hand in the morning.  
Hi Padma.  
glad to see you on the list. you are probably right about ᳚karamUle tu  
gauri cha᳚   this makes a more consistent subhAshita   but sometimes there  
are more than one versions of a subhAshita in existence with small  
differences   and both of them are ᳚correct᳚   again, gauri makes a better  
pATh than govindaH ....  
  
thanks !  
kedar  
  
%ASAD[13]  
(fwd)  
Thanks for the sholka.  This shoka about Kshama  and the line of thinking.  
and other features that go with it were adopted by Gandhiji for our freedom.  
There was the other group (jahal) who asked questions like what should be  
done for the person who is determined to kill you regardless of what you  
are thinking.  Examples were given from the 2nd war and how a cretain  
group of people was removed by force etc.  So the jahals justified their  
line of thinking.  
  
%ASAD[13]  
  
कराग्रे वसते लक्ष्मीः करमध्ये सरस्वती ।  
करमूले तु गोविन्दः प्रभाते करदर्शनम् ॥  
  
  
If I rememeber the sloka it is ᳚karamule tu gouricha᳚ it's not govondaH.  
Laxmi resides at the tip of the hand, sarasvati in the middle,  Gouri(Parvati)  
at the root. Hence one should take ᳚darshan᳚ of one's hand in the morning.  
Hi Padma.  
glad to see you on the list. you are probably right about ᳚karamUle tu  
gauri cha᳚   this makes a more consistent subhAshita   but sometimes there  
are more than one versions of a subhAshita in existence with small  
differences   and both of them are ᳚correct᳚   again, gauri makes a better  
pATh than govindaH ....  
  
I have come across ᳚karamulethu govinda᳚ in my child hood.  
recently I heard even the other one ᳚ karamu lethu gauri cha᳚.  
So obviously the subhashitham was subjected to changes as time passed  
, We cannot argue which is correct as we don't know the  
exact source of this work.. Let us accept both, as both are having  
good meanings.  
कराग्रे वसते लक्ष्मीः  . ᳚At the top    of the hand resides LakShmi.  
करमध्ये सरस्वती     .  In the middle of the hand resides Sarasvati.  
करमूले वसेत् ब्रह्माः  .  At the bottom of the hand resides Brahma.  
प्रभाते करदर्स्'अनं   .  In the morning, the sight of the hands  
.  (is auspicious).  
समुद्रवसने देवी       . ᳚O goddess with the mantle of oceans.  
पर्वतस्तन मण्डले     .  adorned with the breasts of mountains.  
विष्णुपत्नी नम्स्तुभ्यं   .  O the consort of Vishnu, salutations to thee!  
पादस्पर्शं क्षमस्वमे᳚ .  pardon me for touching thee with my feet.᳚  
Note: The above prayers are generally recited as soon as one gets up    from the  
bed.  In the first sloka, LakShmi stands for spiritual wealth,    Sarasvati for  
spiritual knowledge and Brahma for spiritual wisdom.  
According to the Hindu mythology, God Vishnu has two wives, Sri Devi  
(LakShmi) and Bhoomi Devi (Earth).  They are supposed to be residing    on His  
chest.  For defiling the Earth with our feet and also with our    body fluids,  
we beseech Her pardon.  
This concludes the Earth Day specials.  
  
%ASAD[15]  
  
काकः कृष्णः पिकः कृष्णः को भेदः पिककाकयोः ।  
वसन्तसमये प्राप्ते काकः काकः पिकः पिकः ॥  
  
  
The crow is black, and the cuckoo is black. What is the difference between the  
two ? It is when spring arrives that the crow is identified as the crow, and  
the cuckoo, the cuckoo.  
  
%ASAD[16]  
  
सज्जनस्य हृदयं नवनीतं यद्वदन्ति कवयस्तदलीकम् ।  
अन्यदेहविलसत्परितापात् सज्जनो द्रवति, नो नवनीतम् ॥  
  
  
Poets say that the heart of a good man is like butter, but that is not  
correct. The heat (frustration/sorrow/ etc.) residing in another body does  
not melt butter, but it does melt the good man.  
  
%ASAD[17]  
I do not know whether the following two verses were indeed like a  
sawAl jawAb, but it definitely seems so  
  
काचं मणिं काञ्चनमेकसूत्रे मुग्धा निब्ध्नन्ति किमत्र चित्रम् ।  
विचारवान् पाणिनिरेकसूत्रे श्वानं युवानं मघवानमाह ॥  
  
शुनेव यूना प्रसभं मघोना प्रधर्शिता गौत्मधर्मपत्नी ।  
विचारवान् पाणिनिरेकसूत्रे श्वानं युवानं मघवानमाह ॥  
  
  
The first verse :   What is so strange about women tying glass, beads and  
gold all on one thread ? Even the great thinker paNini tied the dog, the  
youth and Indra on the same string .. (pun on the word sUtra)  
The second verse : Gautam's wife was forcibly molested by the youth Indra.  
(who acted) like a dog. the great thinker pAnini tied the dog, the youth  
and Indra on the same string ...  
  
I guess I should have clarified. the three words : shvA (dog) yuvA (youth) and  
maghavA (indra) belong to the same grammatical class .. they are declined  
identically, and there is a sUtra (rule) in Panini's grammar that ties them  
together. ...  
  
hence the pun on sUtra...  
  
  
%ASAD[18]  
  
निःस्वो वष्टि शतं शती दशशतं लक्षं सह्स्राधिपः  
लक्षेशः क्षितिपालतां क्षितिपतिश्चक्रेशतां वाञ्छति ।  
चक्रेशः पुनरिन्द्रतां सुरपतिः ब्राह्मं पदं वाञ्छति  
ब्रह्मा शैवपदं शिवो हरिपदं चाशावधिं को गतः ॥  
  
  
The penniless man wishes  for a hundred, the onw who has hundred wants a  
thousand, the one with a thousand , a lakh. The one with a lakh wants to be  
the king, the king wants to be the emperor, and the emperor wants to be  
Indra (king of Gods), Indra want's brahma's position, brahma shiva's and  
shiva viShNu's ... who has ever been able to kill desire ?  
  
%ASAD[19]  
  
निन्दन्तु नीतिनिपुणा यदि वा स्तुवन्तु  
लक्ष्मीः समाविशतु गच्छतु वा यथेष्टम् ।  
अद्यैव वा मरणमस्तु युगान्तरे वा  
न्याय्यात्पथः प्रविचलन्ति पदं न धीराः ॥  
  
  
Whether the philosophers praise him or criticize,  whether lakShmi enters  
the house or goes away as she wishes, whether death is today itself or after  
an eon, great men never step a foot away from the path of justice.  
for marathi readers :    
  
निन्दोत वानोत सुनीतिमन्त चळो असो वा कमला गृहात      ।  
हो मृत्यु आजिच घडो युगान्ती सन्मार्ग टाकोनि भले न जाती ॥  
  
  
  
%ASAD[20]  
Hi.  
Padma pointed out a typo I had made. Instead of pa~ncha, I had just  
written pa~na ... The corrected shloka is as follows :    
  
स्वयं पञ्चमुखः पुत्रौ गजाननषडाननौ ।  
दिगम्बरः कथं जीवेत् अन्नपूर्णा न चेद्गृहे ॥  
  
  
five mouthed himself(Shiva), and sons   the elephant mouth (Ganesh)  and  
the one with six mouths (Kartikeya)  .. how would shiva survive if  
Annapurna (Parvati) was not at home ?  
  
%ASAD[21]  
  
स्वयं महेशः शव्शुरो नगेशः सखा धनेशश्च सुतो गणेशः ।  
तथापि भिक्षाटनमेव शम्भोः बलीयसी केवलमीश्वरेच्छा ॥  
  
  
Himself the great lord, his father in law the king of mountains, his  
friend the king of wealth, his and his son the lord of the gaNas.  
even then roaming around begging for food is shiva's destiny   only god's  
wish is powerful ...  
  
  
%ASAD[23]  
  
गर्जसि मेघ न यच्छसि तोयं चातकपक्षी व्याकुलितोऽहम् ।  
दैवादिह यदि दक्षिणवातः क्व त्वं क्वाहं क्व च जलपातः ॥  
  
  
O cloud, you roar, but do not give water. I, the chatak bird am thirsty.  
If fatefully the southern winds blow here, where shall you be , where  
shall I be and where shall it rain ?  
  
%ASAD[22]  
  
रे रे चातक ! सावधानमनसा मित्र क्षणं श्रूयतां  
अम्भोदा बहवो वसन्ति गगने सर्वेऽपि नैकादृशाः ।  
केचित् वृष्टिभिरार्द्रयन्ति धरणीं गर्जन्ति केचिद्वृथा  
यं यं पश्यसि तस्य तस्य पुरतो मा ब्ऱूहि दीनं वचः ॥  
  
  
O chatak, my friend, listen for a moment with an alert mind. there are many  
clouds in the sky, not all of them are alike. Some wet the earth by their  
showers, whereas some just roar. Dont beg pitifully in front of each and  
every one you come across !  
  
%ASAD[24]  
  
रात्रिर्गमिष्यति भविष्यति सुप्रभातं  
भास्वान्  उदेश्यति हसिष्यति पङ्कजश्रीः ।  
इत्थं विचिन्तयति कोषगते द्विरेफ़े  
हा हन्त हन्त नलिनिं गज उज्जहार ॥  
  
  
The night shall go away and it shall be dawn. The sun will rise and the  
lotus will smile ! While the bumblebee trapped in the lotus was thinking  
this, Alas ! an elephant uprooted the lotus !  
  
%ASAD[25]  
  
मन्ये संस्कृते एतत् प्रथमं काव्यं वाल्मिकिना कृतं  
  
I believe this is the first piece of verse in Sanskrit ; composed by Valmiki  
  
मा निषाद प्रतिष्ठां त्वं अगमः शाश्वतीः समाः ।  
यत्क्रौञ्चमिथुनादेकं अवधीः काममोहितम् ॥  
  
  
O niShAda, you will not come to glory till the end of eternity. for you have  
killed one from a pair of krauncha birds, enraptured in love.  
This is the first shloka in Ramayana as Krishna told me some time ago. As the  
meaning indicates, Valmiki was inspired to write this shloka when he saw a  
hunter shooting one of two krauncha birds who were engaged in rati.  
I believe this is the first piece of verse in Sanskrit ; composed by Valmiki  
  
मा निषाद प्रतिष्ठां त्वं अगमः शाश्वतीः समाः ।  
यत्क्रौञ्चमिथुनादेकं अवधीः काममोहितम् ॥  
  
  
O niShAda, you will not come to glory till the end of eternity. for you have  
killed one from a pair of krauncha birds, enraptured in love.  
This is the first shloka in Ramayana as Krishna told me some time ago. As the  
meaning indicates, Valmiki was inspired to write this shloka when he saw a  
hunter shooting one of two krauncha birds who were engaged in rati.  
This was one of the first shlokas that I learned in my Sanskrit class  
in the 5th grade, and all the info below is based on what I learned  
then. most of the people on this net may already be familiar with the  
significance of this shloka. ever composed by Adikavi (first poet) vAlmIki.  
He was in a peaceful  
state of mind (either meditating or taking a walk) when this niShAda  
(hunter) killed the male krauncha (swan?). vAlmIki got angry with  
the actions of the hunter and this shloka came out of his mouth. After  
vAlmIki emerged out of his rage, he realized that he had gone out of  
the state of equanimity and cursed the hunter out.  
It was then that someone else (nArada?) appeared and told him that he  
had uttered the first piece of poetry and explained to him that there  
was a second meaning behind the shloka.  
I don't remember what the other interpretation of this shloka is  
except that the hunter is rAma and the krauncha(s) are rAvaNa and  
mandodarI, and that rAma kills rAvaNa. I don't remember what the  
second interpretation of the shrApa (curse) is when applied to rAma.  
So this is how the shloka fits into the rAmayaNa.  
  
%ASAD[26]  
  
न हि कश्चित् विजानाति किं कस्य श्वो भविष्यति ।  
अतः श्वः करणीयानि कुर्यादद्यैव बुद्धिमान् ॥  
  
  
No one knows what will happen to whom tomorrow. So a wise man should do all of  
tomorrow's tasks today.  
  
(कल्ह् करै सो आज् कर् ॥॥)  
 tomorrow  =  श्वह्  
 day after tomorrow  =  परश्वह्  
 2 days after tomorrow  =  प्रपरश्वह्  
 yesterday  =  ह्यह्  
 day before yesterday  =  परह्यह्  
 2 days before yesterday  =  प्रपरह्यह्

विघ्नैः पुनः पुनरपि प्रतिहन्यमानाः  
प्रारब्धमुत्तमजना न परित्यजन्ति ॥  
  
  
Inferior men do not start (any endeavor) with the fear of obstructions.  
Average men , stop an endeavor when they are faced with problems. However.  
even though they are struck  again and again by disaster, superior men  
never give up an endeavor that they have undertaken.

सिंहः शिशुरपि निपतति

The lion, even when a cub, attacks jumps upon the cheek of an intoxicated  
elephant. It is  indeed the nature of the courageous :  the age of the  
glorious ones is never relevant.  
and for the marathi crowd, here's a marathi translation :    
  
सिंहाचा तो बाल तो हि चपेट  
मारी त्याला जो करी मत्त् मोठा  ।  
तेजस्वी जे वृत्ति ऐसीच त्यान्चि  
तेथे काहि चाड नाहि वयाची  ॥

a~Nkura means the first sprout. yathA bIjastathA~NkuraH is a very famous  
proverb. it basically means as you sow, so you reap ...  
  
  
न धैर्येण विन ळक्ष्मिः न शोउर्येण विन ज़यः ।

यथा काष्ठं च काष्ठं च समेयातां महोदधौ ।

As two logs of wood come together in the ocean, and immediately go away  
from each other, so much alike is mankind ...  
  
and for the marathi people, another translation : this one from the geeta  
rAmAyana by madgulkar in the song  
  
᳚पराधीन आहे जगति पुत्र मानवाचा।  
दोश ना कुणाचा᳚ :

One should not steal anything belonging to anyone, should not utter a  
sensitive sentence, should remember (bow down to) Vishnu's feet, and thus  
swim the ocean of life with ease.  
  
%ASAD[31]  
This ASAD is a small tribute to my sanskrit teacher, Shri Vasant  
Nanivadekar. He resides in Bombay, and is very well versed with the sanskrit  
classics as well as conversational sanskrit. He is an active ᳚kAryakartA᳚ in  
many sanskrit related projects and activities in Bombay. Above all, along with  
my mother he is the one who has introduced me to this great world of Sanskrit  
verse and literature.  
What follows is his translation of Tennyson's ᳚Home they brought her warrior  
dead᳚ into sanskrit verse.  
  
गेहानीतेऽप्यसुविर्हहिते वीरहिंहे स्वनाथे  
मोहं प्राप्त न च न च सखी क्रन्दितुं वा प्रवृत्ता ।  
पश्यन् देवीं परिहन इदं  प्राह मर्माहतां तां  
नो चेद् रुद्यात् इयमपि भत् प्राणहीनाचिरेण ॥  
  
  
Home they brought her warrior dead  
She nor swooned nor uttered cry  
All her maidens watching said  
᳚She must weep or she will die.᳚  
  
लोकैर्मन्दं विनतहृदयैः संस्तुतो वीर एवं  
स्नेहस्यासीत् खलु नरवरो भाजनं श्लाघनीयम् ।  
संहार्दं वा नरतनुधरं शत्रुरौदार्यमूर्तिः  
नोचे किङ्चित् तदपि किल सा नाल्पमात्रं चचाल ॥  
  
  
Then they praised him soft and low  
Called him worthy to be loved  
Truest friend and noblest foe  
Yet she neither spoke, nor moved.  
  
स्वीय स्थानात् तदनु शनकैः कापि दासी तदानीं  
प्राप्ता वीरं निभृतगमना कानि गत्वा पदानि  
दूरीचक्रे नरवर मुखाच्छादि वस्त्रं कराभ्यां  
किङ्चिन्मात्रं न हि विचलिता नापि वा सा रुरोद  
  
Stole a maiden from her place  
Lightly to the warrior stept  
Took the face cloth from the face  
Yet she neither moved, nor wept.  
  
काचिद् वृद्धा नवतिशरदां दीर्घमायुः दधाना  
क्रोडे तस्याः प्रियतमशिशुं स्थापयामास धात्री  
ग्ऱीष्मे वृष्टिं जलद इव सा बाष्पपूरं मुमोच

Rose a nurse of nintey years  
Set his child upon her knee  
Like summer tempest came her tears  
᳚Sweet my child, I live for thee !᳚  
  
%ASAD[31]  
There were two errors in the first paragraph in my earlier posting. This is the  
corrected version :    
  
गेहानीतेऽप्यसुविर्हहिते वीरसिंहे स्वनाथे  
मोहं प्राप्त न च न च सखी क्रन्दितुं वा प्रवृत्ता ।  
पश्यन् देवीं परिहन इदं  प्राह मर्माहतां तां  
नो चेद् रुद्यात् इयमपि भवेत् प्राणहीनाचिरेण ॥  
  
  
  
%ASAD[32]  
  
साहित्य सङ्गीत कला विहीनः साक्षात् पशुः पुछ विषाण हीनः ।  
तृणं न खादन्नपि जीवमानः तद् भागधेयं परमं पषूणाम् ॥  
  
  
The man without (love of) literature music or the arts is indeed an animal  
without a tail or horns. The fact that he survives even without eating  
grass is indeed a great piece of luck for the other animals.  
  
%ASAD[33]  
This one is similar to ASAD[32]  
in meaning :    
  
येषां न विद्या न तपो न दानं  
ज्ञानं न शीलं न गुणो न धर्मः ।  
ते मर्त्यलोके भुविभारभूताः  
मनुष्यरूपेण मॄगाश्चरन्ति ॥  
  
  
Those who do not have learning, perseverence, are not charitable, do not  
have wisdom, character, good qualities or relegion, are indeed a burden to  
on the earth in the mortal world, and live as animals in the form of man.  
  
%ASAD[34]  
  
अधिगत्य गुरोः ज्ञानं छात्रेभ्यो वितरन्ति ये ।

The teachers who distribute knowledge among the students after getting it  
from their gurus, and who are storehouses of love and knowledge, are  
indeed like God to me.  
  
%ASAD[35]  
  
अश्वस्य भूषणं वेगो मत्तं स्याद् गजभूषणम् ।  
चातुर्यं भूषणं नार्या उद्योगो नरभूषणम् ॥

of the elephant. Cleverness is the ornament of a woman, and  
industriousness is the ornament of a man.

The ink may be like a black mountain, the sea may be the inkpot, A branch  
of the tree of gods (kalpataru / mandAra ...I believe there are five of  
them) may be used as a pen, and the whole earth be used as the paper. If  
even Sharada (Goddess Sarasvati) writes for all the time using all this  
material, even then, O lord, she will not come to the end of describing  
your good qualities.

I believe this may be originally in some Purana; it's in  
Pancha tantra as well as in UpadeSAmRita of RUpa Goswami.  
᳚Six symptoms of affection are giving, receiving, explaining in  
confidence and enquiring, accepting food and feeding.᳚

I haven't heard this one before, so the following may be off the mark to  
some extent  
Giving, return of courtesy, sharing secrets, asking [for one's welfare?] eating  
[with one?] , feeding, these are six characteristics of love.  
you are almost right. here is the accurate meaning :    
gives, takes, tells and asks secrets, eats (from you) and feeds (you) are    the  
six characteristics of love ... (friendship would perhaps be more    appropriate  
here .. )  
  
क्षते प्रहाराः निपतन्ति अभीक्ष्णं

When the money is gone (become poor), the hunger increases  
At the time of trouble, the enemities crop up  
when you are divided (without unity),  problems become plenty.  
I do not know the meaning of ᳚abhIkShNaM᳚. The meaning of first line  
depends upon this word.  
I think ᳚samudbhada.nti᳚ should be ᳚samudbhava.nti᳚.  
Basically, the SubhAshita is trying to tell us that problems crop  
up only when you are devoid of the solution !  
(Murphy's law ?)  
  
क्षते प्रहाराः निपतन्ति अभीक्ष्णं  
  
I do not know the meaning of ᳚abhIkShNaM᳚. The meaning of first line  
depends upon this word.  
Dictionary gives the meaning of abhIkShaNam as ``every moment''; it fits  
here, but is somewhat puzzling. With this meaning, the first pada means  
When wounded, blows fall every moment [The wounded get hit repeatedly]  
IF it is abhikShaNaM, the first line will not obey the meter of the  
shloka. besides that  everything makes sense. (it is basically a version  
of     ᳚ when it rains, it pours ᳚ ...  
  
  
%ASAD[keshavaM patitaM dR^iShTvA]  
  
ख़ेशवम् पतितम् द्रुस्त्व, पन्दवह हर्श् निर्भरह  
ऱुदन्ति कौरवह सर्वे, ह ख़ेशव् ह केशव गतह्  
  
One of the  let me catch my breath shlokas?  
Actually this is a fairly famous one. The ᳚correct᳚ interpretation :    
  
के शवं पतितं दृष्ट्वा पाण्डवा हर्शनिर्भराः  
रुदन्ति कौरवाः सर्वे हा हा के शव के शव  
  
notive that ke and shava have been separated. The word ᳚ka᳚ means water  
(among several other meanings). Hence ke means in water. pANDava also  
means fish; kaurava also means crow. hence the interpretation is :    
Seeing the cadaver (shava) fallen in water, the fish were overjoyed. ALl  
the crows however started crying .. ᳚ O the cadaver in water !!᳚  
  
%ASAD[46]

आत्मनः परितोषाय कवेः काव्यं तथापि तत् ।

     आत्मन्  =  self  
     परितोष  =  satisfaction  
     कवि  =  poet  
     काव्य  =  poetry  
     स्वामि  =  master  
     देहलि  =  doorstep  
     दीप  =  light  
     सम  =  similar  
     अन्य  =  other  
     उपकार  =  favour  
The poetry of poets is always for their own satisfaction, However, like  
the light on the porch of the master's house, it is also beneficial to  
others. (light from the porch illuminates the  inside as well as the  
outside of a house ... )

ईक्षणं द्विगुणं प्रोक्तां भाषणस्येति वेधसा ।

 ईक्षण  =  seeing  
 द्विगुण  =  twice  
 प्रोक्त (प्र + उक्त)  =  said  
 भाषण  =  speaking  
 वेधस्  =  brahmA  
 अक्षि  =  eye  
 द्वे  =  two  
 जिंव्हा  =  tongue  
 निर्मित  =  created  
Seeing is given twice as much importance as speaking by Brahma. Man has  
two eyes, however, only one tongue was created.

उद्यमेन हि सिध्यन्ति कार्याणि न मनोरथैः        ।

 सिध्  =  to be accomplished  
 कार्य  =  work  
 मनोरथ  =  wish  
 सुप्त  =  asleep  
 सिंह  =  lion  
 प्र + विश्  =  to enter  
 मुख  =  mouth  
 मृग  =  deer/animal  
Work is accomplished by effort, not by wishing. Deer do not enter the mouth  
of a sleeping lion.  
Vivek Khare asked me the meaning of the word ᳚hi᳚ in the subhAshita :    
udyamena hi sidhyanti ....  
  
The word hi means nothing. Perhaps it could be interpreted here as an  
emphasizer, but otherwise, it means literaly nothing. The words cha vai tu  
and hi are used in sanskrit by poets to fill up the meter. the words cha  
and tu have meanings, (and and but respectively) but the word vai has no  
meaning, and the word hi may be interpreted as something that emphasizes a  
point.  
In fact I am sure many of you know the famous first attempt by a quack  
poet :    
  
उत्तिष्ठ उत्तिष्ठ राजेन्द्र मुखं प्रक्षालयस्व टः ।  
प्रभाते रोदिती कुक्कु च वै तु हि च वै तु हि ॥  
  
  
The poet thought up these three lines :    
O king, (rajendra), get up get up ! (uttiShTha) mukhaM prakShAlayasva  
(wash your face !) The rooster cries out in the morning (prabhAte roditi  
kukkuTaH )  
the problem was after uttishThottiShTha rAjendra, mukhaM prakShAlayasva  
left one letter less for the eight letter anuShTubh Chanda, and prabhAte  
roditi kukkuTaH had one letter extra ! so this grandmaster took the ᳚TaH᳚  
from kukkuTaH and placed it at the end of the first line ! And now he had  
three out of four parts, and he just coud not think of anything for the  
last part of the verse hence   cha vai tu hi cha vai tu hi !!!  
  
%ASAD[59]  
  
उत्तमो नातिवक्ता स्यात् अधमो बहुभाषते ।

 ध्वनि  =  sound  
 कंस्य  =  bronze  
 प्र + जा  =  to be born  
The great man is rarely somone who talks too much, but the inferior man  
talks too much. There is no sound from gold as there is from bronze.  
  
चिन्तायास्तु चितायास्तु बिन्दु मात्रम् विशेशतः ।  
चिता दहति निर्जीवम्, चिन्ता दहति जीवितम् ॥  
  
  
Meaning:    
Between 'ChintA' (worry) and 'ChitA' (pyre) the only difference  
is dot (anuswAra bindu in chintA, that 'n'). Pyre burns the  
dead, while worry burns the living.  DON'T WORRY BE HAPPY :)  
Ganapthi.  
  
चिता चिन्ता समाप्रोक्ता बिन्दुमात्रं विशेषता ।  
सजीवं दहते चिन्ता निर्जीवं दहते चिता ॥  
  
  
The difference betn ᳚CHINTA᳚ and ᳚CHITA᳚ is just a dot.  
᳚PYRE᳚ burns the dead, while ᳚WORRY᳚  burns the living.  
  
उपकारो हि नीचानां अपकरो हि जायते ।

 उप + कृ  =   to do a favor  
 नीच  =  lowly  
 अप + कृ  =  to harm  
 पयस्  =  milk / water  
 भुजङ्ग  =  snake  
 केवलं  =  only  
 विष  =  posion  
 वर्धन  =  increase  
Even a good turn done to a bad man results in evil. Drinking of milk by  
snakes is only going to result in increase of their poison.

The great ones are famous by their own efforts, The average are famous  
because of their father. The inferior men are famous because of their uncle.  
and the worst among them are famous because of their father in law.  
I interpreted this in a different way. This shubhashita intends to convey the  
wealth  
Most respected weath is the one you earn  
That you inherit from your father is just OK  
One you get from your mother is not good  
And, the one you aquire from wife is the worst  
I am not sure if that were a different version of this shubhashita

Every moment, you are being watched atleast by one of the above !  
The discussion is with reference to recent Subhashitam posted by Raghavendra  
the one with UdyamasAhasaM .... etc..  
  
Hemali Vyas   disagreed with the meaning of the two words Dhairyam and SAhasam  
Ramakrishna from Tokyo disagreed with the Hemali's comments.  
Here is my opinion for whatever it is worth.  
DhairyaM  means Dheeratwa bhavaM   dhee is buddhi or intellect   so in contrast  
to sAhasaM   dhairyaM must involve intellectual conviction.  So in a way Hemali  
Vyas is right   Raghavendra's meaning that it is courage is also right   It  
should be courage born of intellectual conviction not emotional outburst.  We  
all know what is right but many a time we do not have the guts to follow what is  
right   we do what we feel (emotional driven) like doing.  DhairyaM is the  
courage to do what is based on right understanding.  
sAhasaM   I will split as sa + a + hasam  ( I donot have a dictionary at my  
computer desk   this may be my imagination).  
has  if I remember rightly means to smile or to laugh at  
with  a  in front it means opposite   to be serious   that one to take things  
seriously not jokingly  
with prefix sa   it could mean samyak that is total or with   seriously or  
daringly jumping into action   there is no joking around  
in that sense SAhasaM should imply serious adventurous pursuit   in contrast to  
DhairyaM  sAhasaM need not involve intellectual conviction   it could be based  
on just emotional outburst.  So there is a possibility of one getting burned if  
it is not based on sound intellectual judgment.  
Hence the subhashitaM says one needs both the DhairraM and SAhasaM  
Just an intellectual curiosity   If I have all the six of them listed   why do I  
need the help of the Deva  
The truth of the matter is if I have all of them I already have the help of the  
Deva.  Having  all the six of them itself is by the grace of Deva too.  In  
Vedanta Shastra, there is a preceding deity for each of the faculties like Indra  
for Bhuddi etc.  Hence having these qualities is  a grace of God too!  
Hari Om!

What you have is His gift to you and what you do with what you have is your gift  
to Him.

The phrase ᳚drishyante api᳚ means they (coconuts) are also seen. i.e.  
if you look for them hard enough, you DO find them i.e. they are scare  
to find. In contrast the ᳚bera᳚ (Hindi) or ᳚bora᳚ (Marathi) or berry  
(English) is seen a lot. i.e. good people are like coconuts, hard  
outside, soft inside and are scarce to find, bad people are like  
berries, soft outside, hard inside, and are found a lot.

i.e the evil people think something else, say something else and do  
something else. The great (good) people think, say and do the same  
thing.

For the lion, nobody need place him on the throne by performing certain  
'samskAras.'  By the power of his self won might alone, he has become the  
lord of the animal kingdom.  This position has come naturally to the  
lion.  
The poet, through the example of the lion's might and natural abilities.  
is simply giving us a simile to paint a picture of the great qualities of  
great people (mahApurushAs).  They too, by their own strength, carry  
themselves forward.  These people need no intermediaries to make their

sumitrAnandana can also be broken up as su mitra Anandana (happiness of  
good friends.  
Why should the ocean cry  on seeing them? No, It is the king rAma, who is  
attached (Asakta) to lakShmaNa (sumitrAnandana) and the dwarfish person is  
agastya himself. The ocean mistakes the poet to be agastya.  
Ocean is afraid of rAma as he once threatened to dry him up when attempting  
to cross over to lanka. The dwarfish  sage agastya is said to have drank the  
ocean. Hence the cause for fear.

Dear Friends.  
The real Humor or Joke is that the following verses are literally true.  The  
practice and theory of medicine is completely wrong in its basis.  This is  
true of all medicine, western, eastern, oriental or otherwise.  Because, as  
you know, the nature follows an immutable cause and effect relationship for  
everything that happens.  The disease is produced by its causes.  The  
practice of medicine does not at all deal with the cause of a disease, but  
it only deals with palliating the symptoms of a disease, further letting the  
causes to continue.   Another, real but sad joke is that even very  
intelligent people, who would otherwise investigate/reasearch everything  
before they practice, subscribe to the practice of medicine without  
questioning the logic.

करोति स्वमुखेनैव बहुधान्यस्य खण्दनम् ।  
नमः पतनशीलाय मुसलाय खलाय च ॥  
  
भावार्थ  
  
By his(its) own mouth he (it) injures (pounds) in many ways other  
people (a lot of grain).  My salutations to the pestle and to the wicked  
man whose character is to fall down.  
(The first line is interpreted in two ways depending on how the sandhi  
in bahudhAnyasya is broken)  
First all of you must take a sigh of relief that I am not  
translating this in Russian. I have a valid comment. The interpretation  
is just not right. The word khala has two meanings. Kedar gives only  
one a wicked man. The second is a mortar. Those partisans of this list  
who were born in cities would not know what this article and its use  
is/was. It is a piece of stone, preferably, granite which is carved like  
a mortar. Mortar and pestle are two components of a commonly used  
pounding mechanism used in ages all over the world. Pounding removes  
chaff from grain. Its use in India declined after mechanical grain  
brayers were made available in cities in British rule. The use continued  
for some time in numerous villages or inaccessible regions. My father's  
house and that of all my relations had at least one. My mom, auntie and  
sisters would wake up early in the morning and do their chores with  
mortar and pestle singing songs.  
The meaning as given by Kedar lacks certain truth. Why would  
poet, or for that matter, anybody thank a wicked man whose character is  
to fall down?. In chaturvarNya scheme four classes were assigned certain  
duties and responsibilities. When they performed such social obligations  
they earned the social acceptance. On this background poet takes a case  
of a habitually misbehaving person patanshIla and examines his  
contributions to the society. Even though he lacks social acceptance due  
to his nature, the poet opines, his peculiar behavior, actually  
contributes to the social needs.  
Ancient Indians were taught to be polite to each other.  
respectful to each other, friendly and forgiving to each other. These  
codes of conducts brought social harmony, but created a situation where  
blunt, bold actions were frowned upon. People, therefore, would get away  
with murder, so to say, and nobody would criticize or check their  
actions. Remember politeness rules. Our patanshIla was exception to this  
rule. Therefore, when he got mad at sombody or something he would lash  
out at them and separate their true selves from their alter egos. In  
other words he would tear the masks of dichotomous, contradictory.  
personalities. Poet, obviously is paying compliments to such a person.  
However, he cannot openly come out and praise such a man or his actions.  
Therefore, the poet resorts to the double talk, ambiguity.  
double entendre technique. Smart person would find the true meaning  
behind the obvious.  
Nobody writes a couplet praising mortar and pestle, they are so  
unpoetic. So the true meaning of this couplet is:    
By his own mouth he, patanshIla, pounds most of the times people  
hiding behind veneers and exposes their true nature, salutions to him  
and his brute force 'musala'.
