 Notes:    
1. shiva and mahesha are the names of Lord Shiva also.  
Sri Shankara states that shiva and viShNu are one and  
the same. The purANic shloka   
शिवाय विष्णुरूपाय शिवरूपाय विष्णवे ।  
शिवस्य हृदयम् विश्णु विष्णोश्च हृदयम् शिवः ॥  
  
 and so on also asserts the same.   
  
 2. Lord RAma ruled Ayodhya for 11,000 years according  
to the Ramayana. Even today a model state is referred to  
as a 'rAmarAjya'.   
  
 3. This reminds me of a nindA-stuthi in Kannada by  
Sri PurandaradAsa. He says 'ninnantha swAmi enaguNTu  
ninagilla' meaning 'I have a master and Lord like You.  
You have no master like Yourself'.   
  
यदावर्णयत्कर्णमूलेऽन्तकाले  
      शिवो राम रामेति रामेति काश्याम् ।  
तदेकं परं तारकब्रह्मरूपं  
       भजेऽहं भजेऽहं भजेऽहं भजेऽहम् ॥ ३ ॥  
  
यत्  = That (which)   
काश्याम्  = in kAshi (vArANasi),   
अन्तकाले  = at the time of Death,   
कर्णमूले  = in ones ears,   
शिवः  = Lord Shiva,   
राम रामेति रामेति  = as rAma rAma rAma   
आवर्णयत्  = whispered (described)   
तत्  = That form which is   
एकम्  = Undivided,   
परम्  = the greatest   
तारकब्रह्मरूपम्  = of the form of tArakabrahma  
(rescuing devotees from the ocean of samsAra (the ephemeral world))   
भजेऽहं  = I adore (worship)   
  
 I adore shrI rAma ,the Unity, the greatest one,  
whose name is uttered in the ears of the blessed  
devotees in KAshi at the time of Death by none other  
than Lord Shiva Himself. This form/name of the Lord  
(tArakabrahma) is capable of rescuing devotees from  
the ocean of samsAra.   
  
 Note:    
It is a well known belief that Lord Shiva utters rAma  
nAma in the ears of dying devotees in kAshi, on the  
banks of the Holy Ganga, thereby granting them mokSha.  
  
Lord Shiva is known for His Love of rAma nAma.  
In the phala shruthi of the Sri ViShNu sahasranAma,  
He answers Goddess Parvathi's question as to how the  
names of Lord ViShNu are remembered by learned ones as   
 श्रीरामरामरामेति रमे रामे मनोरमे ।  
 सहस्रनाम तत्तुल्यं राम नाम वरानने ॥  
  
 The thousand names of Lord ViShNu are equivalent to  
one rAma nAma recited as ᳚shrI rAma rAma ...᳚.   
  
महारत्नपीठे शुभे कल्पमूले  
      सुखासीनमादित्यकोटिप्रकाशम् ।  
सदा जानकीलक्ष्मणोपेतमेकं

                       millions of Suns,

                     jAnakI (sIta) and lakShmaNa,   
एकं  =         one without a second,   
सदा  =         Always,   
रामचन्द्रम्  = Sri RAmachandra (His face compared  
                to  the poetically cool moon),   
भजेऽहं  =   I worship.   
  
 I worship shrI rAmachandra, who is seated  
comfortably on a great gem-studded throne under  
the most auspicious kalpavrikSha. He shines with the  
effulgence of millions of Suns, ever accompanied by  
His consort sIta and brother lakShmaNa. I forever  
adore shrI rAma who is One without a second  
(ekamevAdvitIya).  
  
This is a beautiful dhyAna shloka of the Lord.  
  
This verse followed by the next two describe a  
beautiful scenario in which shrI rAma's magnificence  
is described. It is a pity that translations cannot  
bring out the hidden beauty of the original  
language.   
  
क्वणद्रत्नमञ्जीरपादारविन्दम्  
      लसन्मेखलाचारुपीताम्बराढ्यम् ।  
महारत्नहारोल्लसत्कौस्तुभाङ्गं  
      नदच्चञ्चरीमञ्जरीलोलमालम् ॥ ५ ॥

लसन्-मेखला  =    with a glittering waistband,

                         garment,

                gem-studded necklace,   
कौस्तुभान्गम्  = with the most auspicious kaustubha  
 gem on His chest,   
नदच्-चञ्चरी-मञ्जरी-लोलमालम्  = adorned with  
                flower garlands with bees buzzing  
                 around the flowers   
  
 shrI rAma's lotus feet are adorned by sweetly  
jingling gem-studded anklets. He is wearing a  
beautiful yellow garment with a glittering waistband.  
He wears a resplendent gem necklace with the Kaustubha  
gem on His chest. A garland with black bees buzzing  
around the flowers bedecks the Lord.  
  
The Kaustubha was one of the gems obtained during the  
churning of the milk ocean.pItAmbara is also used as  
a name for the Lord (one wearing the pItAmbara).   
  
लसच्चन्द्रिकास्मेरशोणाधराभम्  
      समुद्यत्पतङ्गेन्दुकोटिप्रकाशम् ।  
नमद्ब्रह्मरुद्रादिकोटीररत्न-  
       स्फुरत्कान्तिनीराजनाराधितान्घ्रिम् ॥ ६ ॥  
  
लसच्-चन्द्रिका-स्मेर-शोणा-अधराभम्  =  
              With a smile like shining moonlight  
              playing on the beautiful red lips,   
समुद्यत्-पतङ्ग-इन्दु-कोटिप्रकाशम्  =  
              With a brilliance unmatched by  
              millions of rising Suns and Moons,   
आराधितान्घ्रिम्  =  
              With feet worshipped by,   
स्फुरत्-कान्ति-नीराजन  =  
              the Arati (nIrAjana) in the form of  
              radiating lustre,   
नमद्-ब्रह्म-रुद्रादि-कोटीररत्न  =  
              from the millions of gems adorning the  
              crowns of the prostrating brahma,  
              rudra and other gods.   
  
 A moonlight-like shining smile plays on the beautiful  
crimson lips of the Lord. His brilliance is unmatched  
even by millions of rising Suns and Moons. His feet  
are worshipped by the Arati of the radiating lustre  
from the millions of gems adorning the crowns  
of the prostrating brahma,rudra and other gods.  
  
shrI rAma is the paranjyoti, the Supreme  
Illuminator,who is beyond every other  
light including the Sun and the Moon !  
This reminds me of the Geeta shloka 15-6  
'na tadbhAsayate sUryo na shashA~Nkona pAvakaH .'  
and so on and similar mantras from the katha and  
muNDaka upanishads which state 'neither the sun nor  
the moon nor the fire light It (the abode of the  
Lord)'.  
  
The scenario of the nIrAjana from the crowns of  
prostrating gods is seen even in the shivanandalaharI  
stotra of shrI shankara (verse 65).   
'कोटीरोज्ज्वल-रत्न-दीपकलिका-नीराजनम्  
कुर्वते'।  
  
 The same has been used in shrI tyAgaraja's famous  
krithi 'shambho mahAdeva'. 'sura-vrinda-kirITa-maNI-  
vara-nIrajita-pada'. shrI tyAgarAja,one of the  
Trinity of Carnatic music, was one of the greatest  
composer-musicians of South Indian music.   
  
पुरः प्राञ्जलीनाञ्जनेयादिभक्तान्  
       स्वचिन्मुद्रया भद्रया बोधयन्तम् ।

                     chinmudra (jnAna mudra),

सदा  = always,   
न मन्ये   = (O RAma) I will not think   
त्वदन्यं  =  of any other god apart from Thee.   
  
 shrI rAma is teaching brahmavidyA with the  
chinmudra to shrI A~njaneya and other devotees who are  
standing with folded hands. I worship Him again and again. O  
RAma, I will not even think of anybody else (or any  
other god/deity).  
  
Let us meditate on this Divine Scene again.  
  
shrI rAma is clad in Royal attire, with the  
legendary Koustubha gem on His chest. He wears a floral  
garland with the bees buzzing in confusion around the Lord  
and the flowers. A beautiful moonlight like smile is  
playing on His crimson red lips. Brahma, Rudra and  
other gods offer their obeisances at the feet of the  
Lord with the lustre radiating from their crown-jewels.  
A~njaneya and other devotees stand respectfully in  
front of the Lord. shrI rAmachandra is imparting  
brahma-vidyA to all the devotees with the most  
auspicious chinmudra. O shrI rAma, I worship Thee  
again and again. I will not even bring other thoughts  
or gods to my mind.  
  
The chinmudra or the jnAna mudra is a posture with  
the right index finger and the right thumb touching one  
another. All great Gurus are seen with the chinmudra.  
It usually indicates imparting brahma-vidya.  
shrI dakShiNAmUrti, shrI shAradAmba  
and shrI sha~Nkara are most well known for their  
display of the chin-mudra.  
  
The situation of shrI rAma imparting brahma-vidyA  
is reminiscent of shrI dakShiNAmUrti, a  
jnAna-avatAra of Lord shiva. A beautiful dhyAna shloka of  
shrI dakShiNAmUrti is worth mentioning here.   
  
मोउन-व्याख्यान-प्रकटित-परब्रह्मतत्त्वं युवानम् ।  
वर्षिष्ठ-अन्तेवसद्-ऋषि-गणैरावृतं ब्रह्म-निष्ठैः ॥  
  
आचार्येन्द्रं करकलित-चिन्मुद्र-मानन्दरूपम्  
स्वात्मारामं मुदितवदनं दक्षिणामूर्तिमीडे ॥  
  
shrI dakShiNAmUrti teaches brahma-vidyA with his  
silent instruction. While the Teacher is a youth, He  
is surrounded by numerous sages and brahman-realized  
souls. He is the best among the AchArya s.His hand  
displays the chinmudra. He is the embodiment of bliss  
and is always happy within Himself. I bow to shrI  
dakShiNAmUrti with the pleasant look on His face.  
  
यदा मत्समीपं कृतान्तः समेत्य  
      प्रचण्डप्रतापैर्भटैर्भीषयेन्माम् ।  
तदाविष्करोषि त्वदीयं स्वरूपं  
      तदापत्प्रणाशं सकोदण्डबाणम् ॥ ८ ॥

सकोदण्डबाणम्  = with your famous kodaNDa bow and  
                  quiver of arrows.   
  
 O shrI rAma! At the time of death, Lord Yama  
approaches me with his ferocious attendants,  
frightening me. Then You display your form with  
the kodaNDa bow and arrow, which is capable of  
destroying all miseries.  
  
shrI rAma is known as kodaNDa-pANi, the one holding  
the kodaNDa bow. This bow was given by shrI agastya  
to shrI rAma during His exile in the daNDaka forest.  
  
The story of ajAmiLa in the shrImad-bhAgavata is  
brought to mind by this shloka.   
  
निजे मानसे मन्दिरे सन्निधेहि  
      प्रसीद प्रसीद प्रभो रामचन्द्र ।

      रनीकैरनेकैश्च राम प्रसीद  ।  
नमस्ते नमोऽस्त्वीश राम प्रसीद  
      प्रशाधि प्रशाधि प्रकाशं प्रभो माम्  
                                              ॥ १० ॥

vAnara-lords,  
the kings with their armies and other numerous  
devotees, be pleased towards me, Your devotee.  
Many salutations to You, O Lord ! Guide me,Your  
disciple, towards knowledge.  
  
The word shAdhi is seen in the bhagavadgItA (II-7),  
when arjuna asks shrI kRiShNa to 'shAdhi mAm tvAm  
prapannam', that is, to instruct arjuna who had taken  
refuge in Lord kRiShNa.  
  
Is knowledge a right interpretation of the word  
'prakAsha' ?   
  
त्वमेवासि दैवं परं मे यदेकं  
      सुचैतन्यमेतत्त्वदन्यं न मन्ये ।  
यतोऽभूदमेयं वियद्वायुतेजो-

the five primordial elements of Space,Air,Light,Water  
and Earth, as well as the mobile and immobile objects  
of the Universe. I do not regard anybody other than  
You as God.  
  
Though brahman does not physically create the five  
elements, it is in brahman that the entire creation is  
seen. Brahman, being knowledge Itself, is the  
comprehensor and the comprehended. Brahman has been  
described in the shrI lalitA sahasranAma as  
'j~nAna-j~nAtRi-j~neya-rUpA', of the form of  
knowledge, the knower and the known.

devotees. My Salutations to You, O Lord, who are  
attained only by great puNya. I bow to you who are

Salutations to the Father of the Universe.  
Salutations to the Mother of the Universe.  
  
As Lord brahma and Lord rudra, He is the creator  
and the Destroyer of the Universe. Since He is the  
purusha, He is the Enjoyer of prakRiti.  
  
shrImannArAyaNa in His trivikrama avatAra measured  
the entire Universe in three footsteps. So He is  
referred to as the measurer. He is described in the  
puruSha sUkta  as having 'atyatiSThaddashA~Ngulam',  
exceeded the universe,always by 10 finger-widths,  
meaning that He is infinite. How can He not be able to  
measure the Universe ?!  
  
He is the netRi or the Leader of the universe. As the  
trimurti aspect of lord viShNu, He is the Preserver of  
the Universe.  
  
He has conquered the entire Universe. When He is all,  
there is no surprise in His winning the Universe.  
  
Finally He is the Supreme Father and Supreme Mother.

 O shrI rAma, even a lifeless rock obtained vitality  
by the contact with the dust of your Holy Feet. It is  
no surprise,then, if an intelligent human being  
attains Supreme Consciousness by the dedicated service  
of Your Lotus Feet.  
  
shrI sha~Nkara is referring to the story of satI  
ahalyA in the rAmAyaNa. ahalyA was cursed by her  
husband Sage goutama to become a rock. When shrI  
rAma touched that rock with His feet, the rock came  
back to life. That, is the power of the Divine Feet of  
the Lord.

who are the destroyer of the samsAra-miseries and the  
  
Support of the Universe. As a result, during their  
final moments, they do not have the fearsome  
sight of Yama and his attendants.  
  
When one is devoted to the Divine Pastimes of the Lord,  
where will he/she have the time to think of such  
trifles as Death ? The Lord takes care of His devotees  
always. As He has promised all His devotees in the  
gItA (9:22) :   
'अनन्याश्चिन्तयन्तो मां ये जनाः पर्युपासते ।

who considers You, who are  of the form of sat, chit and Ananda,  
who are the best among the devas, and who are beyond mind and  
speech, as his Refuge, is indeed the most fortunate. He is  
indeed worthy of respect.  
  
It can also be read as :    
That being who 'knows' or 'has attained' You is indeed the  
most fortunate and is worthy of respect. He is indeed my Refuge.  
  
In the book I am referring to, the second line of the shloka  
has been printed as  'नरो वेद ये देवचूडामणिं ताम्'।  
 But when I read the Kannada translation, it was different.  
Assuming a printing error in the shloka rather than in the  
translation, I corrected the shloka to go with the translation.

Your childhood itself !  
  
The bow of Lord shiva was worshipped by King Janaka, father  
of sItA mAtA. During the svayamvara of sItA-mAtA, when  
all others struggled to even lift that bow, Lord rAma, while  
attempting to string the bow, broke it.

a man, a deva or an asura, could such an enemy, be defeated ?

O rAma, I, within my heart, worship Your foremost devotee with devotion,  
who constantly prostrates before You.  
  
shrI Anjaneya is the foremost devotee of shrI rAma. During the pUjA of Lord  
Rama, the Lord is always referred to as sItA-lakShmaNa-bharata-shatRighna-  
hanUmat-sameta-shrI-rAmachandra. shrI Hanuman is considered to be an amsha  
of vAyu, the wind god, as also of Lord Shiva. There is a very nice shloka  
about Hanuman's devotion to rAma.

Or:    
None else has sItA for a consort,

the Holy name of rAma ! Enough of all these gods !  
  
shrI rAma alone is worshipful, so where is the need for other gods ?

rAma's great qualities are described here.

deities other than Lord rAma.  
  
Just by worshipping Lord rAma, who has all these wondrous qualities,  
can one attain the Absolute. Why then, does one need other deities?

He bears a smile and revives people from the defects of birth and death,  
Lord rAma alone can be worshipped by us. We do not need the other gods.  
  
During the bridge-building to Lanka, Lord rAma got angry with the  
ocean for not allowing the building work to proceed. That is described  
here. His valor needs no introduction.
