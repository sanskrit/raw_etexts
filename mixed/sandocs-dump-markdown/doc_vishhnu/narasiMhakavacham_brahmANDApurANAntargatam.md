 नरसिंहकवचम्   
  
      ॥ अथ श्री नृसिंहकवचस्तोत्रम् ॥  
  
नृसिंहकवचं वक्ष्ये प्रह्लादेनोदितं पुरा ।  
सर्वरक्षाकरं पुण्यं सर्वोपद्रवनाशनम् ॥ १॥  
 I shall now recite the Narasinha-kavacha, formerly spoken by  
PrahlAda MahArAja . It is most pious, vanquishes all kinds of  
impediments, and provides one all protection .   
सर्व सम्पत्करं चैव स्वर्गमोक्षप्रदायकम् ।  
ध्यात्वा नृसिंहं देवेशं हेमसिंहासनस्थितम् ॥ २॥  
It bestows upon one all opulences and can give one elevation to the  
heavenly planets or liberation . One should meditate on Lord Narasinha,  
Lord of the universe, seated upon a golden throne .   
विवृतास्यं त्रिनयनं शरदिन्दुसमप्रभम् ।  
लक्ष्म्यालिङ्गितवामाङ्गं विभूतिभिरुपाश्रितम् ॥ ३॥  
His mouth is wide open, He has three eyes, and He is as radiant as  
the autumn moon . He is embraced by LakShmIdevI on his left side, and  
His form is the shelter of all opulences, both material and  
spiritual .   
चतुर्भुजं कोमलाङ्गं स्वर्णकुण्डलशोभितम् ।  
सरोजशोभितोरस्कं रत्नकेयूरमुद्रितम् ॥ ४॥  var  रत्नकेयूरशोभितम्  
The Lord has four arms, and His limbs are very soft . He is  
decorated with golden earrings . His chest is resplendent like the  
lotus flower, and His arms are decorated with jewel-studded  
ornaments .   
तप्तकाञ्चनसङ्काशं पीतनिर्मलवाससम् ।  
इन्द्रादिसुरमौलिस्थस्फुरन्माणिक्यदीप्तिभिः ॥ ५॥  
He is dressed in a spotless yellow garment, which exactly resembles  
molten gold . He is the original cause of existence, beyond the mundane  
sphere, for the great demigods headed by Indra . He appears bedecked  
with rubies which are blazingly effulgent .   
विराजितपदद्वन्द्वं शङ्खचक्रादि हेतिभिः ।  
गरुत्मता च विनयात् स्तूयमानं मुदान्वितम् ॥ ६॥  var  सविनयं   
His two feet are very attractive, and He is armed with various  
weapons such as the conch, disc, etc . GaruDa joyfully offers prayers  
with great reverence .   
स्वहृत्कमलसंवासं कृत्वा तु कवचं पठेत् ।  
नृसिंहो मे शिरः पातु लोकरक्षार्थसम्भवः ॥ ७॥  var  आत्मसम्भवः   
Having seated Lord Narasinhadeva upon the lotus of one's heart, one  
should recite the following mantra: May Lord Narasinha, who protects  
all the planetary systems, protect my head .   
सर्वगोऽपि स्तम्भवासः फालं मे रक्षतु ध्वनिम् ।  
नृसिंहो मे दृशौ पातु सोमसूर्याग्निलोचनः ॥ ८॥  
Although the Lord is all-pervading, He hid Himself within a  
pillar . May He protect my speech and the results of my activities . May  
Lord Narasinha, whose eyes are the sun, and fire, protect my eyes .   
स्मृतिं मे पातु नृहरिर्मुनिवर्यस्तुतिप्रियः ।  
नासं मे सिंहनासस्तु मुखं लक्ष्मीमुखप्रियः ॥ ९॥  
May Lord Nrihari, who is pleased by the prayers offered by the  
best of sages, protect my memory . May He who has the nose of a lion  
protect my nose, and may He whose face is very dear to the goddess of  
fortune protect my mouth .   
सर्वविद्याधिपः पातु नृसिंहो रसनां मम ।  
वक्त्रं पात्विन्दुवदनं सदा प्रह्लादवन्दितः ॥ १०॥  
May Lord Narasinha, who is the knower of all sciences, protect my  
sense of taste . May He whose face is beautiful as the full moon and  
who is offered prayers by PrahlAda MahArAja protect my face .   
नृसिंहः पातु मे कण्ठं स्कन्धौ भूभरान्तकृत् ।  
दिव्यास्त्रशोभितभुजो नृसिंहः पातु मे भुजौ ॥ ११॥  
May Lord Narasinha protect my throat . He is the sustainer of the  
earth and the performer of unlimitedly wonderful activities . May He  
protect my shoulders . His arms are resplendent with transcendental  
weapons . May He protect my shoulders .   
करौ मे देववरदो नृसिंहः पातु सर्वतः ।  var  पातु सर्वदा  
हृदयं योगिसाध्यश्च निवासं पातु मे हरिः ॥ १२॥  var  हृददं  
May the Lord, who bestows benedictions upon the demigods, protect  
my hands, and may He protect me from all sides . May He who is achieved  
by the perfect yogIs protect my heart, and may Lord Hari protect my  
dwelling place .   
मध्यं पातु हिरण्याक्षवक्षःकुक्षिविदारणः ।  
नाभिं मे पातु नृहरिः स्वनाभि ब्रह्मसंस्तुतः ॥ १३॥  
May He who ripped apart the chest and abdomen of the great demon  
HiraNyAkSha protect my waist, and may Lord Nrihari protect my  
navel . He is offered prayers by Lord BrahmA, who has sprung from his  
own navel .   
ब्रह्माण्डकोटयः कट्यां यस्यासौ पातु मे कटिम् ।  
गुह्यं मे पातु गुह्यानां मन्त्राणां गुह्यरूपदृक् ॥ १४॥  
May He on whose hips rest all the universes protect my hips . May  
the Lord protect my private parts . He is the knower of all mantras and  
all mysteries, but He Himself is not visible .   
ऊरू मनोभवः पातु जानुनी नररूपधृक् ।  
जङ्घे पातु धराभारहर्ता योऽसौ नृकेसरी ॥ १५॥  
May He who is the original Cupid protect my thighs . May He who  
exhibits a human-like form protect my knees . May the remover of the  
burden of the earth, who appears in a form which is half-man and  
half-lion, protect my calves .   
सुरराज्यप्रदः पातु पादौ मे नृहरीश्वरः ।  
सहस्रशीर्षा पुरुषः पातु मे सर्वशस्तनुम् ॥ १६॥  
May the bestower of heavenly opulence protect my feet . He is the  
Supreme Controller in the form of a man and lion combined . May the  
thousand-headed Supreme enjoyer protect my body from all sides and in  
all respects .

महाविष्णुर्दक्षिणे तु महाज्वालस्तु नैरृतौ ॥ १७॥  
May that most ferocious personality protect me from the east . May  
He who is superior to the greatest heroes protect me from the  
southeast, which is presided over by Agni . May the Supreme Visnu  
protect me from the south, and may that person of blazing luster  
protect me from the southwest .   
पश्चिमे पातु सर्वेशो दिशि मे सर्वतोमुखः ।  
नृसिंहः पातु वायव्यां सौम्यां भूषणविग्रहः ॥ १८॥  
May the Lord of everything protect me from the west . His faces are  
everywhere, so please may He protect me from this direction . May Lord  
Narasinha protect me from the northwest, which is predominated by  
VAyu, and may He whose form is in itself the supreme ornament protect  
me from the north, where Soma resides .   
ईशान्यां पातु भद्रो मे सर्वमङ्गलदायकः ।  var  ईशान्ये  
संसारभयतः पातु मृत्योर्मृत्युर्नृकेसरी ॥ १९॥  
May the all-auspicious Lord, who Himself bestows  
all-auspiciousness, protect from the northeast, the direction of the  
sun-god, and may He who is death personified protect me from fear of  
death and rotation in this material world .   
  
इदं नृसिंहकवचं प्रह्लादमुखमण्डितम् ।  
भक्तिमान् यः पठेन्नित्यं सर्वपापैः प्रमुच्यते ॥ २०॥  var  सर्वपापात्   
This Narasinha-kavacha has been ornamented by issuing from the mouth  
of PrahlAda MahArAja . A devotee who reads this becomes freed from  
all sins .   
पुत्रवान् धनवान् लोके दीर्घायुरुपजायते ।  
यं यं कामयते कामं तं तं प्राप्नोत्यसंशयम् ॥ २१॥  var  कामान्   
Whatever one desires in this world he can attain without doubt . One  
can have wealth, many sons, and a long life .   
सर्वत्र जयमाप्नोति सर्वत्र विजयी भवेत् ।  
भूम्यन्तरीक्षदिव्यानां ग्रहाणां विनिवारणम् ॥ २२॥  
He becomes victorious who desires victory, and indeed becomes a  
conqueror . He wards off the influence of all planets, earthly,  
heavenly, and everything in between .   
वृश्चिकोरगसम्भूत विषापहरणं परम् ।  
ब्रह्मराक्षसयक्षाणां दूरोत्सारणकारणम् ॥ २३॥  
This is the supreme remedy for the poisonous effects of serpents  
and scorpions, and Brahma-rAkShasa ghosts and YakShas are driven  
away .   
भूर्जे वा तालपात्रे वा कवचं लिखितं शुभम् ।  
करमूले धृतं येन सिध्येयुः कर्मसिद्धयः ॥ २४॥  var  तस्य कार्याणि   
One may write this most auspicious prayer on his arm, or inscribe it  
on a palm-leaf and attach it to his wrist, and all his activities will  
become perfect .   
देवासुरमनुष्येषु स्वं स्वमेव जयं लभेत् ।  
एकसन्ध्यं त्रिसन्ध्यं वा यः पठेन्नियतो नरः ॥ २५॥  
One who regularly chants this prayer, whether once or thrice  
(daily), he becomes victorious whether among demigods, demons, or  
human beings .   
सर्वमङ्गलमाङ्गल्यं भुक्तिं मुक्तिं च विन्दति ।  
द्वात्रिंशतिसहस्राणि पठेत् शुद्धात्मनां नृणाम् ॥ २६॥  
  
 var  यः पठेत् शुद्धमानसः ॥  
One who with purified heart recites this prayer 32,000 times  
attains the most auspicious of all auspicious things, and material  
enjoyment and liberation are already understood to be available to  
such a person .   
कवचस्यास्य मन्त्रस्य मन्त्रसिद्धिः प्रजायते ।  
अनेन मन्त्रराजेन कृत्वा भस्माभिमन्त्रणम् ॥ २७॥  
This Kavacha-mantra is the king of all mantras . One attains by it  
what would be attained by anointing oneself with ashes and chanting  
all other mantras .   
तिलकं विन्यसेद्यस्तु तस्य ग्रहभयं हरेत् ।  
त्रिवारं जपमानस्तु दत्तं वार्यभिमन्त्र्य च ॥ २८॥  
  
 var  वारिभ्य मन्त्र्य च  ॥  
Having marked ones body with tilaka, taking Achamana with water,  
and reciting this mantra three times, one will find that the fear of  
all inauspicious planets is removed .   
प्राशयेद्यो नरो मन्त्रं नृसिंहध्यानमाचरेत् ।  
तस्य रोगाः प्रणश्यन्ति ये च स्युः कुक्षिसम्भवाः ॥ २९॥  
That person who recites this mantra, meditating upon Lord  
Narasinhadeva, has all of his diseases vanquished, including those of  
the abdomen .   
किमत्र बहुनोक्तेन नृसिंहसदृशो भवेत् ।  
मनसा चिन्तितं यत्तु स तच्चाप्नोत्यसंशयम् ॥ ३०॥  
Why should more be said? One acquires qualitative oneness with Narasimha  
himself. There is no doubt that the desires in the mind of one who meditates  
will be granted.   
गर्जन्तं गर्जयन्तं निजभुजपटलं स्फोटयन्तं हठन्तं  
रूप्यन्तं तापयन्तं दिवि भुवि दितिजं क्षेपयन्तं क्षिपन्तम् ।  
 var  क्षोभयन्तं क्षिपन्तम् ।  
क्रन्दन्तं रोषयन्तं दिशि दिशि सततं संहरन्तं भरन्तं  var  भ्रमन्तं  
वीक्षन्तं घूर्णयन्तं शरनिकरशतैर्दिव्यसिंहं नमामि ॥ ३१॥ var  करनिकर  
Lord Narasinha roars loudly and causes others to roar . With His  
mulitudes of arms He tears the demons asunder and kills them in this  
way . He is always seeking out and tormenting the demonic descendants  
of Diti, both on this earth planet and in the higher planets, and Hs  
throws them down and scatters them . He shouts with great anger as He  
destroys the demons in all directions, yet with His unlimited hands He  
sustains, protects, and nourishes the cosmic manifestation . I offer my  
respectful obeisances to the Lord, who has assumed the form of a  
transcendental lion .   
॥ इति श्रीब्रह्माण्डपुराणे प्रह्लादोक्तं श्रीनृसिंहकवचं सम्पूर्णम् ॥  
Thus ends the Narasinha-kavacha as it is described by PrahlAda  
MahArAja in the BrahmANDa PurANa .
