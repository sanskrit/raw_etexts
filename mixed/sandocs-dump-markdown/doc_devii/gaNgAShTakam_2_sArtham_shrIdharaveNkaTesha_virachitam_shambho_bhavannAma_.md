 गङ्गाष्टकम् २   
  
GANGASHTAKAM by Shri Shridharavenkatesa of  
Tiruvisanallur respectfully called as Ayyaval.   
॥ श्री अय्यावाल् इति प्रसिद्धैः श्रीधरवेङ्कटेशाभिधैः विरचितम् ॥   
  
Introduction:- Once, the author Shridhara had to perform the  
shrAddha ceremony wherein his ancestors are propitiated. In this  
ceremony three pious brahmins who are well versed in the vedas  
and are of exemplary character are invited. The Manusmriti gives  
details about the qualifications of the brahmins to be invited on  
this occasion. The forefathers are invoked in them. Then these  
brahmins are honoured, as one would do his ancestors with food,  
clothes and dakShina. In Shridhara's case the ceremony fell on  
an Amavasya day in the month of Kartika (8th month of the solar  
calendar). He had made all arrangements to conduct the ceremony as  
ordained in the shastras, including inviting the three brahmins. The  
food items to be served to the brahmins (who represent his ancestors)  
were being cooked. As the preparations were in progress, he heard the  
plaintive cry of a beggar. The beggar was an outcaste. He said he had  
not eaten for hours, and so is famished and distressed. Shridhara,  
who was a very pious person, saw in this outcaste the image of  
Lord Siva and was immensely moved. He immediately gave the  
food items prepared for the shrAddha ceremony to the beggar and  
ensured his hunger was appeased. He beggar ate heartily and went  
away after invoking Lord's blessings on Shridhara and his family  
members. Shridhara came to himself some time after the beggar went  
away and realised his ``folly᳚.  One is not expected to serve the  
food prepared specifically for serving to the ancestors (invoked  
in the brahmins) to anyone else till the ceremony was over. He was  
very upset and asked the brahmins as to how he should expiate for  
his act. They said that the only way to atone is to take a bath in  
the sacred Ganges. But Shridhara felt that this was impossible to be  
done as the trip to Ganges will take many weeks.  This implied that  
he will not be able to perform the shrAddha ceremony on that day.  
So it will be an act of ommission and will invite serious sin.  
Shridhara felt that the only thing to do in such a predicament is  
to surrender to the Lord. So, in the following verses he explained  
his predicament to Lord Siva and prayed to Him to release Ganga from  
His matted locks as He did on an earlier occasion in response to the  
prayers of sage Bhagirata.  The kindly Lord could not bear to see  
His devotee upset. So He released Ganga from His locks. The well  
in Shridhara's house started to overflow. Many animals like fish,  
tortoises came out along with the gushing waters. The villagers  
were astounded at the sight and were wonderstuck at the intensity  
of Shridhara's piety. They realised his greatness. They requested him  
to control the flow of the water which was threatening to flood the  
village. Shridhara prayed and the flow from Ganges subsided. All,  
including the brahmins who had been invited specially for the  
ceremony were only too willing to accept that if Shridhara took  
bath in the waters of the well it will be equal to a bath in the  
Ganges. Shridhara was very happy at the decision of the brahmins. He  
took bath in the water drawn from the well and completed the shrAddha  
ceremony.  
  
This incident is celebrated every year on the  
Amavasya day in the month of Krittika at the village. The faithful  
throng in large number at the house in Tiruvisanallur village where  
Shridhara lived on that day every year and  take bath in the water  
drawn from the well. They believe that the bath gives the same  
benefit as a bath in the Ganges.  
  
COMMENTS. The scriptures  
assure that a true devotee will not encounter misfortune or problems  
in life. न वासुदेवभक्तानां अशुभं विद्यते क्वचित्।  says  
Vishnusahasranama in the phalashruti. Lord Krishna gives an assurance  
to this effect in Gita (9-31).  कौन्तेय प्रतिजानीहि न मे भक्तः  
प्रणश्यति।  The question, then, is why should devotees like  
Shridhara and many others like Prahladha face problems? The answer  
is that the problems they face may be attributed to prArabdham or  
deeds they might have committed in their past births. But, though the  
problem appears to be of serious nature to us, it does not appear to  
be so to the devotees themselves. They do not lose their serenity in  
the face of adversity, nor is there least change in their devotion.  
घृष्टं घृष्टं पुनरपि पुनश्चन्दनं चारु गन्धं  
छिन्नं छिन्नं पुनरपि पुनः स्वादु चै-वेक्षुखण्डम् ।  
दग्धं दग्धं पुनरपि पुनः काञ्चनं कान्तवर्णं  
न प्राणान्ते प्रकृतिविकृतिः जायते सज्जनानाम् ॥   
This says that a piece of sandal wood, when repeatedly rubbed against a  
stone emits only a pleasant flavour. Even when the  sugarcane is cut into  
many pieces it will continue to taste sweet only. A chunk of gold  
when heated in the fire again and again will give out its natural  
shine only. So also, the qualities of the great people will not  
undergo the least change even at the end of their lives. To repeat,  
a devotee of the Lord will certainly encounter problems. They are  
designed by the Lord to bring out the devotee's unshakeable faith  
in the Lord so that others may understand his greatness. The  
devotee himself never complains that he is undergoing immense  
suffering. But he thinks of the Lord as usual for help. He gets it  
and is happy that his problem is solved.  In fact, Kunti-the mother  
of Pandavas, cleverly converted the problems into advantage. She  
found from experience that she thought of the Lord whenever she  
faced a problem. Krishna promptly appeared on the scene and helped  
her. So, she prayed to Krishna that she should face problems every  
now and then so that she can have His darshan often. She said:  
विपदः सन्तु नः शश्वत्तत्र तत्र जगद्गुरो।  
भवतो दर्शनं यस्मादपुनर्भव-दर्शनम्॥  Shri Bhagavatam (1-8-25).  
  
The verses of Gangashtakam are given below. The translations of the  
verses given here are not exact.    
  
शम्भो भवन्नाम निरन्तरानुसन्धान भाग्येन भवन्तमेव ।  
यद्येव सर्वत्र तथाऽन्त्यजेऽद्य पश्यत्यहो कोऽत्र कृतोऽपराधः ॥ १॥  
O Lord Shambhu! I am used to repeating Your name all the time. As  
a result I am blessed to see You only every where. So, today I  
saw You only in this outcaste also.  Is there anything wrong in  
this?  
  
अस्त्वेष मन्तुः पितृयज्ञ निष्टे गङाप्लवो यो विहितोऽपचित्यै ।  
दूरात्तु तन्नामजपेन शुद्धिः न स्यात् कथं मे स्मृतिरर्थवादः ॥ २॥  
Let me agree that a bath  
in the Ganges is the proper atonement for my transgression of the  
rules pertaining to the shrAddha ceremony. But the Smriti texts  
say that even if one just repeats the name ``Ganga᳚ few times he  
becomes pure. Can not I take recourse to this expediency in this  
situation?  
  
त्वन्नामनिष्टा न हि तावतो मे श्रद्धा यतः कर्मसु न प्रदग्धा ।  
त्रैशङ्कवं मे पसुपान्तरायः मुच्येय तस्मात्कथं आर्तबन्धो ॥ ३॥  
O Lord, I accept that I have not  
got that intense faith in Your name that I can give up performance  
of duties like shrAddha. Thus I am in an awkward situation, like  
king Trishanku. How do I get relieved from this situation?  
  
यद्यद्य ते श्राद्धविनष्टिरिष्टा कोऽहं ततोऽन्यच्चरितुं समर्थः ।  
श्राद्धे वृताः पूर्वदिनोपवासाः नान्यत्र भुञ्जीयुः इदं तु खिद्ये ॥ ४॥  
If it is Your wish that the shrAddha  
should be missed let it be lost.  I cannot go against Your will.  
But, what about the brahmins who have been specially invited for the  
occasion? They have been fasting since yesterday and will not take  
food at any other place.  
  
श्रद्धालवः श्राद्धविघातभीत्या स्वात्मोपरोधं विघणय्य धीराः ।  
यत्प्रोचुरत्रापचितिं महान्तः तत्रोचितं यद्दयया विधेहि ॥ ५॥  
These brahmins  
are noble souls. They have prescribed the expiation, not with any  
selfish motive but only to make sure that the shrAddha should not  
become deficient in any manner. They have not taken into account  
the inconvenience that they will face in the process.  
  
गङ्गाधर! त्वद्भजनान्तराय भीत्या गृहे कूपकृतावगाहः ।  
जाने न तीर्थान्तरं अद्य गङ्गां आसादयेयं कथमार्तबन्धो! ॥ ६॥  
On account of the  
fear that the chanting of Your name should not be interrupted  
even for a moment, I have been taking bath only in the well in  
the house itself. I do not know any other holy river or waters.  
This being the case, how will I go in search of Ganga?  
  
नाहं तपस्वी सगरन्ववायः जाने न जहह्नुः चरति क्ववेति ।  
शम्भो! जटाजूटमपावृणुष्वेत्यभ्यर्थने नालमयं वराकः ॥ ७॥  
I am not an ascetic like Bhagiratha nor do  
I know the whereabouts of the sage Jahnu.  I am not qualified  
even to pray to You to release Ganga from Your locks.  
  
गङ्गाधराख्या गतिरत्र नान्या तामाश्रये सङ्कट-मोचनाय ।  
हन्त! प्रवाहः कथमत्र कूपे विस्पूर्जतीशः खलु ते प्रसन्नः ॥ ८॥  
So, Your name Gangadhara is my refuge. I see  
no other way out. Oh!  What a wonder!  Even as i say this, I see  
the well overflowing! surely, the Lord has shown mercy.  
  
गङ्गेति गङ्गेति हरति गृण्हन् आप्लावितोहं दयया पुरारेः ।  
कूपोत्तितोयं करुणाप्रवाहः गाङ्गश्चिरायात्र जनान् पुनातु ॥ ९॥  
As I repeat the name ``Ganga᳚, the very mercy  
of the Lord has taken the form of a flood and submerged me. May  
this flow of the waters of Ganga purify the people in the days to  
come.  
  
CONCLUSION. One may ask as to how it was possible for  
Shridhara to have a vision of Siva in a beggar.  The answer is that  
he was convinced that every thing in this world is the Lord only  
and there is no second thing.  Krishna says this in the Bhagavad  
Gita. He explains that He manifests Himself as the world using the  
power of maya.  Though He is every thing in the world, people are  
deluded by the powerful maya. Their vision is veiled. They see the  
objects and overlook the God behind them. As an example, we see that  
several ornaments are made of a piece gold. They are given various  
names like bangle, chain etc.  If we think a bit we will find that  
the word ``bangle᳚ is not a substance but only a name given to a  
particular shape of gold. Gold can exist as gold but bangle cannot  
exist without the gold. Similarly, a person can go to sleep and  
have a dream. The dream is not substantial and is dependant on the  
dreamer; but not the other way round.  Such things as the ornament  
that have no separate existence but have shape and name are called  
unreal objects or मिथ्या वस्तु . They do not have a permanent  
existence.  A bangle may be melted and made into another ornament  
any number of times. They are therefore impermanent or अनित्यम्।   
But the items like gold that lend substance to them are known as  
real or सत्यम्। . They are permanent or नित्यम् . They do  
not change when the ornament is changed.  We may say that gold  
pervades the bangle as, really speaking, there is no such thing  
as bangle. Krishna says He pervades the entire universe.  
मया ततमिदं सर्वं जगदव्यक्त-मूर्तिना।  Gita(9-4).  The right  
knowledge will, then, be to understand first that the ornament  
is gold. Overlooking the very existence of gold will be a major  
error and will have serious consequences.  Extending this idea, we  
should be able to see that every thing in this universe विश्वम्   
is impermanent and changing. People and animals come and go. So do  
the seas and mountains. We learn that even the sun and the stars  
are not permanent but have limited life only. Thus, the universe is   
अनित्यम्  only.  These impermanent, changing objects are many  
names and forms of the Lord only.  In other words God is the real  
thing or सत्यम्। .  God gives substance to the world and is the  
substratum or अधिष्ठानम्।  Krishna explains this to Arjuna and  
says the right vision is to see Him every where.  But we are taken  
by the world and do not see the God hiding behind it. To start with,  
we do not see the Lord within us, but identify ourselves with the  
bodies. This results in numerous problems. We have to take care  
of the body, ensure it is fed and clothed properly. We require so  
many things to protect it and keep it happy and secure. To get all  
these things we have to work hard. The need for comfort and security  
makes us desire many things.  We get a family and friends around  
ourselves. We import their joys and sorrows on to ourselves. This  
leads to likes and dislikes. We like things and people who add to  
our joy and comforts and dislike those who do not.  This corrupts  
our minds. As we go on working hard for ourselves and our family and  
friends, we do many things that are right and many times compromise  
with values and do wrong things. The results are puNyam and pApam.  
We have to enjoy the fruits of the puNyam and pApam in our account  
and to do this we have to take one or many births.  Repeated births  
and deaths is sorrow only. The only way out of this problem is to  
have the right vision that shows that God is in every thing and every  
where. Yama tells this to Nachiketha in Kathopanishad. (2-1-10).  
यदेवेह तदमुत्र यदमुत्र तदन्विह।  
मृत्योः स मृत्युमाप्नोति य इह नानेव पश्यति॥   
He says that one who sees plurality is  
condemned to be born and die again and again.  Krishna says that  
by intense devotion one gets an understanding of the Lord's true  
nature and gets such a right vision. Gita (18-55).   
भक्त्या मां अभिजानाति यावान्यश्चास्मि तत्त्वतः।   
Thus a true devotee is able to see the Lord in every being.    
विद्याविनय-सम्पन्ने ब्राह्मणे गवि हस्तिनि ।  
शुनि चैव श्वपाके च पण्डिताः समदर्शिनः॥  Gita (5-18).  
He says that a person endowed with wisdom sees the same  
brahman in a brahmin endowed with wisdom and humility, in a cow, an  
elephant as also in a dog, and in an outcaste who eats a dog. Sage  
Narada said the same in his advice to Yudishtira. Bhagavatha (7-14-9).  
मृगोष्ट्र-खर-मर्काखु-सरीसृप्खगमक्षिकाः ।  
आत्मनः पुत्रवत् पश्येत् तैरेषामन्तरं कियत् ॥   
One should look upon a deer, camels, donkeys, monkeys, rats, reptiles,  
birds and flies as though they were his own children. What is it  
that makes them separate from these (own children)?  
The  vedic seers had this grand vision. The great vedic hymn Shri Rudram has  
three hundred salutations to the Lord, not by His names, but as  
being available in various beings, both animate and inanimate. He is  
saluted as being the one available in the streams, shoals, clouds,  
lightnings, trees, grass, animals like horses, vultures and even  
in cheats and thieves!  Because the hymn contains such a lofty  
idea its recitation is very inspiring.  But, everyone may not be  
expected to study the scriptures like the upanishads, Gita and Shri  
Rudram. Understanding this limitation of the people in general our  
rishis had incorporated these valuable ideas in the popular hymns.  
We see these names encountered above विश्वम् , सत्यः , and   
अधिष्ठानम्  in the Vishnusahasranamam. One of Lalita's names in  
Lalitasahasranamam (No. 734) मिथ्याजगदधिष्ठाना।  (i.e.) She is  
the substratum of this unreal universe, says this fact explicitly. As  
we keep on reading or reciting these prayers, the great vedantic  
truths contained in them will gradually enter our mind and change  
our concept of God. That is why we have the practice of pArAyaNam or  
reciting such stotras daily.  By repeated reading we will understand  
that God is not a Being residing in remote places like Vaikuntha or  
Kailasa, but He is very intimately avilable in any thing we see or  
hear about - including our bodies.  This is said in the Narayana Suktam   
यच्च किञ्चिज्जगत्सर्वं दृश्यते श्रूयतेऽपि वा ।  
अन्तर्बहिश्च तत्सर्वं व्याप्य नारायण-स्थितः।   
Understanding and accepting the facts stated above will cause a great  
change in our personality and attitude. We will know that we are  
surrounded by God resident in all things and beings. So, we are  
never alone or away from Him.  This idea will give us great sense  
of security, as we can get His help at any time or place.  
Krishna says this in Gita(6-30).  
यो मां पश्यति सर्वत्र सर्वं च मयि पश्यति ।  
तस्याहं न प्रणश्यामि स च मे न प्रणश्यति ॥   
Since He is in all things and beings we will show great  
respect and love for them. We will enjoy immense peace of mind and  
confidence. This is how the great men like the sages and saints could  
be calm and enjoyed happiness.  Thus Shridhara's experience teaches  
us an important lesson to be followed in life.
