 श्रीकनकधारास्तोत्रम्   
  
अङ्गं हरेः पुलकभूषणमाश्रयन्ती  
भृङ्गाङ्गनेव मुकुलाभरणं तमालम् ।  
अङ्गीकृताखिलविभूतिरपाङ्गलीला  
माङ्गल्यदाऽस्तु मम मङ्गलदेवतायाः ॥ १॥  
  
The dark Tamala tree in full bloom attracts the female  
beetle and even so MahalakShmi is attracted and finds  
happiness in the fragrant and dark-complexioned body  
of Hari and makes it tingle with joy. May she bestow on  
me prosperity by her auspicious glance.Note: The poet  
in Shankara compares the dark Tamala tree to thedark  
beautiful form of Vishnu, the dark beetle to the black  
lustrous eyes of MahalakShmi. The glance of LakShmi's  
eyes on Vishnu gives him great happiness. A mere  
momentary flash of her eyes on anybody will bless him  
with prosperity.. 1 ..  
मुग्धा मुहुर्विदधती वदने मुरारेः  
प्रेमत्रपाप्रणिहितानि गतागतानि ।  
माला दृशोर्मधुकरीव महोत्पले या  
सा मे श्रियं दिशतु सागरसम्भवायाः ॥ २॥  
  
The shy love-laden sidelong glance of the beauteous  
dark eyes of the daughter oof the Milky Ocean, returns  
again and again to the beauteous lotus face of Murari,  
just like the black bee constantly returning and flitting  
about the beautiful blue lotus flower. I pray that these  
glances be bestowed upon me to bless me with prosperity.  
Note: The dark beauteous face of the Lord is likened to the  
blue lotus. The dark glance rests upon the handsome face  
of the Lord and out of shyness the eyes are turned away  
but love again makes the glance rest upon the Lord. This  
series of sidelong glances are likened here to a string or Mala  
and they further look like the series of trips which the honey  
seeking black bee makes to the blue lotus. The devotee hopes  
taht he will be prosperous if a sidelong glance of the Goddess  
of Wealth falls at least momentarily on him... 2 ..  
आमीलिताक्षमधिगम्य मुदा मुकुन्दं  
आनन्दकन्दमनिमेषमनङ्गतन्त्रम् ।  
आकेकरस्थितकनीनिकपक्ष्मनेत्रं  
भूत्यै भवेन्मम भुजङ्गशयाङ्गनायाः ॥ ३॥  
  
The eyes of Mukunda remain closed in ecstasy. The beauteous  
dark eyes of LakShmi remain fixed on Mukunda in love and  
wonder and remain open without blinking. May these eyes of  
MahalakShmi fall on me and bless me with prosperity and happiness.. 3 ..  
बाह्वन्तरे मधुजितः श्रितकौस्तुभे या  
हारावलीव हरिनीलमयी विभाति ।  
कामप्रदा भगवतोऽपि कटाक्षमाला  
कल्याणमावहतु मे कमलालयायाः ॥ ४॥  
  
Lord Vishnu whose chest is adorned by the Kaustubha  
Mala is also adorned by the series of the beauteous  
glances of Goddess MahalakShmi. This string of glances  
resembles a necklace of precious blue stones of  
Indraneela and they are capable of fulfilling all the wishes  
of Hari Himself. May this string of glances be directed  
towards me so that it will bring me auspiciousness.. 4 ..  
कालाम्बुदालिललितोरसि कैटभारेः  
धाराधरे स्फुरति या तडिदङ्गनेव ।  
मातुस्समस्तजगतां महनीयमूर्तिः  
भद्राणि मे दिशतु भार्गवनन्दनायाः ॥ ५॥  
  
MahalakShmi shining on the dark broad chest of  
Mahavishnu is like the streak of lightning illuminating  
the dark rain clouds. May she, the daughter of the  
Sage Bhargava worshipped as Mother by the entire  
universe, bring me auspiciousness.. 5 ..  
प्राप्तं पदं प्रथमतः खलु यत्प्रभावात्  
माङ्गल्यभाजि मधुमाथिनि मन्मथेन ।  
मय्यापतेत्तदिह मन्थरमीक्षणार्धं  
मन्दालसं च मकरालयकन्यकायाः ॥ ६॥  
  
The God of Love, Manmatha, could gain access to  
Madhusudana (the destroyer of the demon Madhu, i.e.  
Vishnu) only because he was favored with the blessing  
glance from MahalakShmi . May her auspicious indolent  
sideglance fall on me (May she bless me with prosperity  
by looking at me in passing at least for a moment .. 6 ..  
विश्वामरेन्द्रपदविभ्रमदानदक्षं  
आनन्दहेतुरधिकं मुरविद्विषोऽपि ।  
ईषन्निषीदतु मयि क्षणमीक्षणार्धम्  
इन्दीवरोदरसहोदरमिन्दिरायाः ॥ ७॥  
  
The status of the king of kings or the exal;ted position  
of an Indra are given effortlessly by MahalakShmi by a mere  
momentary glance. Murari (Vishnu) who is supreme bliss  
itself is made happy by it. May this glance from the blue-  
lotus eyes of LakShmi fall on me for a moment at least.  
Note: The beautepus lotus eyes flashing momentarily on  
someone is capable of making him a king of kings ir even  
an Indra. Murari the seat of all bliss is thrown into ecstasy  
by it. Will she not glance at me , even for a second?.. 7..  
इष्टाविशिष्टमतयोऽपि यया दयार्द्र-  
दृष्ट्या त्रिविष्टपपदं सुलभं लभन्ते ।  
दृष्टिः प्रहृष्टकमलोदरदीप्तिरिष्टां  
पुष्टिं कृषीष्ट मम पुष्करविष्टरायाः ॥ ८॥  
The higher worlds like Swarga which are difficult of attainment  
and for which great sacrifices like Ashwamedha are performed  
become easily attainable by the compassion filled look of the  
lotus eyes of MahalakShmi . May she look at me so that I may  
attain my heart's desires. .. 8 ..  
दद्याद्दयानुपवनो द्रविणाम्बुधारां  
अस्मिन्नकिञ्चनविहङ्गशिशौ विषण्णे ।  
दुष्कर्मधर्ममपनीय चिराय दूरं  
नारायणप्रणयिनीनयनाम्बुवाहः ॥ ९॥  
  
The dark rain clouds driven by the monsoon winds  
releases rain on the parched earth and quench the  
thirst of the Chataka bird and brings prosperity on the  
earth. In like manner may the dark eyes of MahalakShmi  
resembling the rain cloud wafted by the breeze of compassion  
relese the rain of prosperity on this devotee of a Chataka  
bird stricken with the load of accumulated sins so that  
the sins are washed away and prosperity bestowed upon him.. 9 ..  
गीर्देवतेति गरुडध्वजसुन्दरीति  
शाकम्भरीति शशिशेखरवल्लभेति ।  
सृष्टिस्थितिप्रलयकेलिषु संस्थितायै  
तस्यै नमस्त्रिभुवनैकगुरोस्तरुण्यै ॥ १०॥  
  
We offer obeisance to the Goddess MahalakShmi,  
the consort of Narayana, the preceptor of all the three  
worlds. She is variously known as Saraswati the Goddess  
of Learning, as Goddess LakShmi, the Divine consort  
of Mahavishnu, as Shakambhari or as Parvati the consort  
of Lord Maheshwara. Verily it is she who is playfully engaged  
in creation, protaction and final destruction of the Universe.. 10 ..  
श्रुत्यै नमोऽस्तु शुभकर्मफलप्रसूत्यै  
रत्यै नमोऽस्तु रमणीयगुणार्णवायै ।  
शक्त्यै नमोऽस्तु शतपत्रनिकेतनायै

O Goddess as the very manifestation of the Vedas,  
you grant the fruits of godd action. Beautiful in form like  
Rati Devi you are the very ocean of superlatively  
beautiful qualities. Having your abode in the beautiful  
lotus of a hundred petals, you are Shakti personified.

plenty. Please accept my obeisance .. 11 ..

नमोऽस्तु नारायणवल्लभायै ॥ १२॥  
  
O Consort of Narayana! Whose face is as beautiful  
as the lotus in bloom, I bow down to thee . Born  
out of the milky ocean, along with the moon and the  
Divine nectar, O Goddess! accept my pranams.. 12 ..  
नमोऽस्तु हेमाम्बुजपीठिकायै  
नमोऽस्तु भूमण्डलनायिकायै ।  
नमोऽस्तु देवादिदयापरायै  
नमोऽस्तु शार्ङ्गायुधवल्लभायै ॥ १३॥  
  
I prostrate before you, O Goddess, who are seated  
on the Golden Lotus, who is Goddess of the earth, the  
consort of Narayana, compassionate to the Devas.. 13 ..

नमोऽस्तु दामोदरवल्लभायै ॥ १४॥  
  
My obeisance to you, O daughter of Bhrigu, consort  
of Damadara. O LakShmi, seated on Lotus and adorning  
the broad chest of Mahavishnu, my salutations to Thee.. 14 ..  
नमोऽस्तु कान्त्यै कमलेक्षणायै  
नमोऽस्तु भूत्यै भुवनप्रसूत्यै ।  
नमोऽस्तु देवादिभिरर्चितायै  
नमोऽस्तु नन्दात्मजवल्लभायै ॥ १५॥  
  
O Consort of Gopala, the son of Nanda, you  
are worshipped by the Devas. You are Jyoti  
incarnate, I prostrate before Thee. Your eyes  
are like lotus petals. You have created the world  
and you bestow prosperity. Please accept my  
salutations.. 15 ..  
सम्पत्कराणि सकलेन्द्रियनन्दनानि  
साम्राज्यदानविभवानि सरोरुहाक्षि ।  var  सरोरुहाणि  
त्वद्वन्दनानि दुरितोद्धरणोद्यतानि  
मामेव मातरनिशं कलयन्तु मान्ये ॥ १६॥  
  
May I always have the desire to prostrate before you  
because a pranam to you is capable of bestowing all  
prosperity and will bring happiness to all the senses.  
Worshipping O Lotus-eyed Goddess not only removes  
all miseries but it confers happiness and plenty.. 16 ..  
यत्कटाक्षसमुपासनाविधिः  
सेवकस्य सकलार्थसम्पदः ।  
सन्तनोति वचनाङ्गमानसैः  
त्वां मुरारिहृदयेश्वरीं भजे ॥ १७॥  
  
The devotee who worships your KatakSha (sidelong  
glance) is blessed with wealth and prosperity. To you,  
the queen who dominates the heart of Vishnu, my  
pranamas, through word, thought, and deed.. 17 ..  
सरसिजनिलये सरोजहस्ते

त्रिभुवनभूतिकरि प्रसीद मह्यम् ॥ १८॥

O mother of all the worlds, consort of Vishnu the lord of  
the Universe, the Dig-gajas (the celestial elephants guarding

Deva Ganga poured ouitfrom golden vessels. O daughter of  
the milky ocean, I prostrate before Thee.. 19 ..  
कमले कमलाक्षवल्लभे त्वं

प्रथमं पात्रमकृत्रिमं दयायाः ॥ २०॥
