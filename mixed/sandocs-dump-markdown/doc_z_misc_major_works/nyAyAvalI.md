The maxim of the blind man and the bull's tail.   
This maxim is based on the following anecdote: Once upon a time a certain blind  
man started from his native village, intending to go to a neighbouring big  
city. He had not plodded on far, when he met a barber, fond of practical jokes.  
The latter accosted the former and learnt from him, that he, the blind man, was  
travelling to town, where, he thought, plenty of alms was to be had for the  
mere asking. The barber, finding a sure victim of his jokes, told the blind man  
that he would find him a guide. He thereupon took him to a field, where a  
bullock was grazing, and let him catch his tail. He then said to him: ᳚My  
friend, here is a sure guide for you. Don't leave him whatever happens, and in

unreasonable act is done.

there was a large number of persons. Now the man thought within himself, there  
are so many persons in the boat that it would be no wonder if I lose myself and  
be transferred and changed to one of them.᳚ In order to avert such a calamity,  
Ahibhuk, bound his foot with a piece of rope to keep a mark upon himself, and  
then feeling easy in his mind, fell fast asleep. The boatman chanced to  
overhear the man's loud soliloquy, and saw his queer manoeuvres; and soon
