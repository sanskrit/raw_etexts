           Excerpts from dakShiNAmUrti upaniShad  
Rama Balasubramanian  
  
सोऽहमिति यावदास्थितिः सा निष्ठा भवति ।  
तदभेदेन मन्वाम्रेडनं ज्ञानसाधनम् ।  
चित्ते तदेकतानता परिकरः ।  
अङ्गचेष्टार्पणं बलिः ।  
त्रीणि धामानि कालः ।  
द्वादशान्तपदं स्थानमिति ।  
  
Devotion consists in firmly dwelling in the constant thought that I am He.  
Repetition of the mantra as inseparate from Him constitutes the means to that  
knowledge . To be concentrated in thought upon Him exclusively proves an  
effective aid to it . The dedicating of all bodily activity (to Him) forms the  
offering . The three states of consciousness are the proper time for it . The  
proper place is the twelve pointed seat.  
  
ते ह पुनः श्रद्दधानास्तम् प्रत्यूचुः ।  
कथं वाऽ स्योदयः ।  
किं स्वरूपम् ।  
को वाऽस्योपासकः ।  
इति ।  
  
Then they again asked him as follows, full of faith . How comes His  
manifestation? What is His form? And who is His worshiper?  
  
स होवाच ।  
वैराग्यतैलसम्पूर्णे भक्तिवर्तिसमन्विते ।  
प्रबोधपूर्ण पात्रे तु ज्ञप्तिदीपं विलोकयेत् ।  
मोहान्धकारनिस्सारे उदेति स्वयमेव हि ।  
वैराग्यमरणिं कृत्वा ज्ञानं कृत्वोत्तरारणिम् ।  
गाढताम्रिस्रंसशान्त्यै गूढमर्थं निवेदयेत् ।  
मोहभानुजसङ्क्रान्तं विवेकाख्यं मृकुन्डुजम् ।  
तत्वाविचारपाशेन बद्धं द्वैतभयातुरम् ।  
उज्जीवयन्निजानन्दे स्वस्वरूपेण संस्थितः ।  
शेमुषी दक्षिणा प्रोक्ता सा यस्याभीक्षणे मुकम् ।  
दक्षिणाभिमुखः प्रोक्तः शिवेऽसौ ब्रह्मवादिभिः ।  
सर्गादिकाले भगवन् विरिञ्चि रुपास्यैनं सर्गसामर्थ्यमाप्य ।  
तुतोष चित्ते वाञ्चितार्थाश्च लब्ध्वा धन्यः सोऽस्योपासको भवति  
धाता ।  
  
He said:    
In the mighty lamp of wisdom, overflowing with the oil of vairagya and  
furnished with the wick of bhakti, one should kindle the light of knowledge and  
see . Then the darkness of disillusion being dispelled, (Siva) Himself becomes  
manifested . With a view to dispel the utter darkness, the devotee should  
produce fire, making vairagya the lower arani and knowledge the upper one; and  
then Siva will exhibit to his view the hidden reality . Dwelling in the devotee  
as his own, very Self with His inherent bliss, He revives viveka hitherto  
overpowered with delusion and oppressed by duality for want of proper enquiry  
into truth . Thus Siva, showing Himself in all his bliss, restores to life the  
son of Mrikandu, hitherto oppressed with the fear of Yama, the latter dragging  
him with the bands of rope tied around his body.  
The word dakShina means Buddhi . Because buddhi is the eye by which Siva can be  
directly seen, He is called DakShinamurthy by the Brahma-vadins.  
At the beginning of creation, Brahma the Lord, having worshiped Siva, attained  
power to create and was delighted at heart . The devotee in this path, steady in  
his effort, attains all objects of desire and becomes quite happy.
