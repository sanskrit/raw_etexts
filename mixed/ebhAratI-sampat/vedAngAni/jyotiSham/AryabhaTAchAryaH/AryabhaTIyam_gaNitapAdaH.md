P R E F A C E.

 This edition of the work is based on three palmleaf manuscripts respectively marked**क**,**ख** and**ग**. The first two were obtained from the Palace Library, Trivandrum and the third from the library of the Raja of Kilimanur. The manuscript**क** went out of hand when its paper transcript was taken up for examination for the Press and it has not since been available for use, and hence no description of it is given here. The manuscript**ख** runs up to a portion of the 25th Sūtra in the Golapada, while the manuscript **ग** contains some fragments of the Gaṇitapāda and the whole of the Golapāda. These two manuscripts which alone were available for collation are legibly written and appear to be about two centuries old. There is a noticeable gap in both the manuscripts **क** and **ख** after the passage **‘अत्रापीच्छाप्रमाणराशी पूर्वोक्तावेव’** on page 118 in the Bhāṣya of the 17th Sūtra of the Gaṇitapāda and the same in ख was found filled up by **‘र्श्वद्वयं** **व्यासार्धतुल्यं**’ which is evidently a piece of the Bhāṣya text having no connection with the context. As this piece however, was found to fit in another gap found in the Bhãṣya of the 18th Sūtra in the Ganitapāda, it was accordingly placed there. There is also a third gap in both the manuscripts **क** and**ख** after the passage ‘**तुल्यसंख्यत्वादेवोक्तम्’** in the Bhāṣya on the 18th Sūtra in the Gaṇ

itapāda. All my attempts to fill up this gap have hitherto been in vain. I secured a loan of the manuscript of Nīlakaṇtha Bhāṣya from the Central Manuscript Library, Baroda, but to my surprise and disappointment, the same gap was found in that copy also as in our manuscript **क.**This circumstance kindled my curiosity to know how two manuscripts coming from such two distant countries contained one and the same gap, but I postpone my enquiry in the matter to a future occasion, when I shall have secured other manuscripts of the work for the Department. A complete manuscript of the work has not yet been procured; however, in view of the rare merit of the Bhāṣya, I have placed the first part before the learned public.

 I take this opportunity of expressing my sincere appreciation of the commendable patience and enthusiasm shown by the Pandits of the department in preparing this difficult and erudite work for the Press, notwithstanding the fact that the manuscript materials at their disposal were far from satisfactory.

MBAŚIVA ŚĀSTRI.



I N T R O D U C T I O N.

 With the publication of the first part containing the Gaṇitapāda of Āryabhaṭīya, the Trivandrum Sanskrit Series is numerically entering on the second centesimal cycle. The Jyotiśśāstra is composed of three branches, viz., Gaṇita, Samhita and Horā, and the Āryabhaṭīya deals with the Gaṇita branch. The work consists of four parts or Pādas, namely, Gītikāpāda, Gaṇitapāda, Kālakriyāpāda and Golapāda.There is another division of the work, the first consisting of Gītikāpāda of 13 Āryā verses and the second, comprised of the three other Pādas containing 108 Āryā verses; and thus the work contains on the whole 121 Arya verses.

 The work had been a mine of knowledge for, Lalla, Muñjāla and Bhāskarācārya who respectively wrote Šiṣyadhīvṛddhida, Mānasakaraṇa and Siddhāntaśiromaṇi after observations of the planetary movements. After studying the Brahmasiddhānta and other work of his predecessors and observing the planetary movements of his time, Āryabhaṭa wrote his work for the benefit of the succeeding generations of students.

Āryabhata.

 In explaining the line **“कुसुमपुरेऽभ्यार्चितं ज्ञानम्”** in the introductory verse of the Gaṇitapāda, the commentator Bhāskara observes **“अयंकिल स्वायंभुवसिद्धान्तः कुसुमपुरनिवासिभिः कृतिभिः पूजितः सत्स्वपि पौलिशरोमकवासिष्ठसौर्येषु, तेनाह कुसुमपुरेऽभ्यर्चितं ज्ञानमिति”** that isĀryabhaṭafollowed the Svāyambhuva Siddhānta as it had been highly respected by the learned people of Kusumapura. At the outset of his Bhāṣya Nīlakaṇṭha says **‘अश्मकजनपदजात आर्यभटाचार्यः’**that is Āryabhaṭa was a native of the country called Aśmaka. It is said that this country was a part of Southern India, while some take it to be the same as the ancient Travancore; see, for example Apte's Sanskrit Dictionary. The work of Āryabhaṭa has long been popular in Kerala more than in any other country and the commentators of the work are all of them known to be Keralīyas. It is therefore possible that Āryabhaṭa was a native of Kerala and migrated to Kusumapura, the imperial capital of the Guptas, for patronage; and it is a matter for congratulation f he was a native of Travancore, a part of the Kerala country.



From the Ā

rya verse,

“षष्ट्यब्दानां षष्टिर्यदा व्यतीतास्त्रयश्च युगपादाः।  
त्र्यधिका विंशतिरब्दास्तदेह मम जन्मनोऽतीताः ॥”  

                           (Kālakriyā pāda Ślo.10)

we learn that Āryabhaṭa flourished in the latter half of the 5th century A.D., and that this work which was written by him when he was only 23 years old, was received by the public very favourably though he was so young.

Keralīyas and their development in Jyotisa.

 Since the time of Bhāskarācārya, Northern India is not known to have produced as many original writers on Jyotiśśāstra as the Kerala country in Southern India. Verily, the stars that shone on the their development sky of Kerala might have felt highly propitiated inasmuch as the intellect of the Keralīyas found in astronomy a fitting field to work upon and produced Bṛhadbhāskarīya Dṛggaṇita, Tantrasaṅgraha, Siddhāntadarpana and many other valuable works. It is a pity that these precious works are still slumbering in the archives of this country, though their publications are highly to be wished for.

ĀryabhaṭīyaBhāṣya

 Among the valuable works on Āstronomy, one is the Bhāṣya on Āryabhaṭīya by Nīlakaṇṭha. It is worthy of note that no one who is not a Keralīya has hitherto ventured to write either a Bhāṣya or a Vyākhyā on the Āryabhaṭīya The Vyākhyā named Bhaṭadīpikā on the work, printed and published in Holland was written by no other than Parameśvarācārya of Kerala, who, for the first time, propounded the Dṛggaṇitatantra after 55 years of study. This fact is evident from the following verses found in the introduction of his commentaries on the Āryabhaṭīya and Līlāvatī,

“लीलावती भास्करीयं लघु चान्यच्च मानसम्।  
व्याख्यातं शिष्यबोधार्थं येन प्राक् तेन चाधुना॥  
तन्त्रस्यार्यभटीयस्य व्याख्याल्पा क्रियते मया।  
परमादीश्वराख्येन नाम्नात्र भटदीपिका॥”  
“नीलायाः सागरस्यापि तीरस्थः परमेश्वरः।  
व्याख्यानमस्मै बालाय लीलावत्याः करोम्यहम्॥”

which state clearly that Parameśvarācārya lived on the bank of the River Nīla near the sea shore in North Kerala.



 The Bhā

ṣya of Nīlakaṇṭha is called Mahabhā

ṣya as is seen from the words of the author himself,

 **“श्रीमदार्यभटाचार्यविरचित्तसिद्धान्तव्याख्याने महाभाष्ये उत्तरभागे युक्तिप्रतिपादनपरे त्यक्तान्यथाप्रतिपत्तौ निरस्तदुर्व्याख्याप्रपञ्चे समुद्घाटितगूढार्थे सकलजनपदजातमनुजहिते निदर्शितगीतिपादार्थे सर्वज्योतिषामयनरहस्यार्थनिदर्शकेसमुदाहृतमाधवादिगणितज्ञाचार्यकृतयुक्तिसमुदाये निरस्ताखिलविप्रतिपत्ति-प्रपञ्चसमुपजनितसर्वज्योतिषामयनविदमलहृदयसरसिजविकासे निर्मले गम्भीरे अन्यूनानतिरिक्ते गणितपादगतार्यात्रयस्त्रिंशद्व्याख्यानं समाप्तम्।” (p. 180).**

As it closely follows the methods adopted by Pataṅjali in his Vyākaraṇamahābhāṣya, I think this Bhāṣya fully deserves the name Mahābhāṣya while the epithets **युक्तिप्रतिपादनपरे, त्यक्तान्यथाप्रतिपत्तौ** &c. used as referring to Mahābhāṣya in the above quotation also go to justify the title. It is a matter for satisfaction that we have been enabled to publish a work on astronomy which goes a long way to remove the charge levelled against Jvotiṣa that there is no expository Bhāṣya in it as in other Śastras. From the following observations in the Bhāṣya,

 **“यन्मयात्र केषांचित् सूत्राणां तद्युक्तीः प्रतिपाद्य कौषीतकिनाढ्येन नारायणाख्येन व्याख्यानं कारितं अतस्तदेवात्र लिख्यते॥” (p.113) .**

 **“इतीदं प्रथमे वयस्येव वर्तमानेन मया द्वितीयवयसि स्थितेन कौषीतकिनाक्येन कारितम्। अत्र केषाञ्चिद् युक्तयः पुनरस्मदनुजेन शङ्कराख्थेन तत्समीपेऽध्यापयता वर्तमानेन तस्मै प्रतिपादिताः। तस्याढ्यत्वात् स्वातन्त्र्याञ्चतत्र व्यापारश्च निर्वृतः। तस्मिन् स्वर्गते पुनरत एव मयाद्य प्रवयसा ज्ञाता युक्तीः प्रतिपादयितुं भास्करादिभिरम्यथाव्याख्यातानां कर्माण्यपि प्रतिपादयितुं यथा कथञ्चिदेव व्याख्यानमारब्धम्।” ( p.156).**

it appears that the author is adding to his text the ‘portion of another Bhāṣya that was caused to be written by Kauṣītaki Nārāyaṅa, but this additional portion of the text runs only on the Sūtras from 15th to 17th but not on those from 18th to 26th, though the author tells us at the close of the 20th Sūtrathat he has transcribed the Bhāṣya of Kauṣītaki up to that extent. The author had not commented on the Gītikāpāda evidently with the idea that the meaning of it would be clear to anyone who studied his Bhāṣya on the three other Pādas as he himself explicitly says,

 **“तत्रेयं त्रिपाद्यस्माभिर्व्याचिख्यासिता, यतस्तद् व्याख्येयरूपत्वाद् गीतिकापादस्यैतद्द्व्याख्यानेनैवार्थः प्रकाशेत”**



 This Bhāṣya which from its rare merits surpasses those of Bhāskarācārya, Sūryadeva, Ghaṭīgopa and others will, I think, be found useful not only by the students of Jyotiśśastra, but also by others interested in Sanskrit literature.

Nilakantha Somasutvan

The closing colophon of the Bhāṣya,  
**“इति श्रीकुण्डग्रामजेन गार्ग्यगोत्रेणाश्वलायनेन.......................  
.....गणितपाद्गतार्यात्रयस्त्रिंशद्व्याख्यानं समाप्तम्।” ( p. 180).**

reveals that Nilakantha was a disciple of Dāmodara, son of Paramesvarācārya, that he was a native of Kuṇda [Grāma](# "Kundagrāma is Trikkandiyûr in British Malabar") and belonged to Garga Gotra and Āśvalāyana Śakhā and that both his father and maternal uncles were named Jātaveda andhis brother Śaṇkara.

 As the commentary on Tantrasaṅgraha explains the first line in the introductory verse,

“हे विष्णो ! निहितं कृत्स्नं जगत् त्वय्येव कारणे।  
ज्योतिषां ज्योतिषे तस्मै नमो नारायणाय ते ॥”

and the third line of the concluding verse,

“गोलः कालक्रिया चापि द्योत्यतेऽत्र मया स्फुटम्।  
लक्ष्मीशनिहितध्यानैरिष्टं सर्वं हि लभ्यते ॥”

as also representing two chronograms of the Kali days on which respectively the work was begun and finished, the date of Nīlakaṅṭha may be fixed between 1450 A.D. 1550 A.D. From the line

“एवं दृग्गणितं शाके त्रीषुविश्वमिते कृतम्।”

in the Dṛggaṇita of Parameśvarācārya, we learn that it was written in Śaka 1353 corresponding to 1430 A.D. It is quite possible therefore that Nīlakaṅṭha, a disciple of Paramesvarācārya wrote his Tantrasaṅgraha some 70 years after the latter wrote his Dṛggaṇita. Nīlakaṅṭha has also written Golasāra, Tantrasaṅgraha, Siddhantadarpaṇa and many other original works; and, among these Golasāra and Tantrasaṅgraha must have been written earlier than the present Bhāṣya which refers to them by name thus,

“एतत्सर्वमस्माभिर्गोलसारे प्रदर्शितम्।  
द्विघ्नान्त्यखण्डनिघ्नात् तत्तज्ज्यार्धात् त्रिभज्याप्तम्।  
अन्त्यादिखण्डयुक्तं त्याज्यं स्यात् पूर्वपूर्वगुणसिद्ध्यै॥” (p.33 ).



“अत एवोक्तं मया तन्त्रसङ्ग्रहे—

शिष्टचापघनषष्ठभागतो विस्तरार्धकृतिभक्तवर्जितम्।  
शिष्टचापमिह शिञ्जिनी भवेत् स्पष्टता भवति चाल्पतावशात् ॥'  

                                   
    (p. 112).

That Nīlakaṇṭha had a very respectable place among the great astronomers of Kerala can be learned from the fact that the author of Sphuṭanirṇaya mentions him along with the venerable persons whom he pays homage to in the introductory verse of the work,

“ब्रह्माणं मिहिरं वसिष्ठपुलिशौगर्गं मयं लोमशं  
 श्रीपत्यार्यभटौ वराहमिहिरं लल्लं च मञ्जालकम्।  
गोविन्दं परमेश्वरं सतनयं श्रीनीलकण्ठं गुरून्  
 बन्दे गोलविदश्च माधवमुखान् वाल्मीकिमुख्यान् कवीन्॥”

 The following passage in the Bhāṣya shows that Nīlakaṇṭha had a brother named Śaṅkara who was equally well versed in the Jyotiśśāstra:—

***śaṅkara brother Nīlakaṇṭha*** 

** “अत्र केषाञ्चिद् युक्तयः पुनरस्मदनुजेन शङ्कराख्येन तत्समीपेऽध्यापयता वर्तमानेन तस्मै प्रतिपादिताः” (P.156).**

Mention may be made here of the sidelight thrown by the works of Nīlakaṇṭha on certain obscure points in regard to Thunchattu Ezhuttacchan, justly regarded as the father of modern Malayalam literature. In my consultations with Mr. Justice P. K. Narayana Pillai B.A., B.L., of the Travancore High Court, who is a member of my Advisory Board, he brought to my notice, the reference to “Sri Nīlakaṇṭha Guru”, in the Harināma Kīrtanam, one of Ezhuttacchan's works. This leads to the information that our Nīlakaṇṭha was the Guru or teacher of Ezhuttacchan.This is strengthened by the allusion to Netra-Nārāyaṇa in Malayalam Brahmāṇḍapurāṇam which is another work by Ezhuttacchan or by a disciple of his, as some would have it. Netra-Nārāyaṇa, as is well known, is the titular appellation of the Āzhuvāncheri Thamprakkal. The Kauṣītaki referred to by Nīlakaṇṭha in the passages quoted above is none other than the Azhuvāncheri Thamprakkal, one of the foremost, if not the foremost dignitary in the West Coast Hierarchy. This is evident from the following reference,

“इति कौषीतकी श्रुत्वा नेत्रनारायणः प्रभुः \।  
मह्यं न्यवेदयत् तस्मै तदैवं प्रत्यपादयम् ॥”

made by Nīlakaṇṭha himself. In the light of this information, the necessary landmarks to fix Ezhuttacchan's date, a point involving some controversy among Malayalam scholars



become easily available, since Nīlakaṇṭha's date is easily gatherable from the chronograms quoted from the Tantrasangraha. This aspect of the subject has been discussed by Mr. Justice Narayana Pillai, in his lectures on Ezhuttacchan delivered recently at the instance of the University of Madras. As he observed during the course of those lectures, Nīlakaṇṭha reveals himself as a solid mass of erudition, submerged some how or other under the current of time.

 Dāmodara, Guru of Nīlakaṇṭha and son of Parameśvarācārya has written a work named Muhurtābharaṇa as is clear from the following introductory verse of the work,

“आचायार्यभटीयसूत्रितमहागूढोक्तिमुक्तावली-  
 मालालङ्कृतयो जयन्ति विमला वाचो यदीयाः शुभाः।  
सूक्ष्मा यत्प्रतिभा च गूढगणितं निश्शेषकाल क्रियां  
 भूगोलं ग्रहवास्तवञ्च तदिदं विश्वं स्फुटं पश्यति॥  
तस्यात्मजः शिष्यवरः प्रसादमाश्रित्य दामोदरनामधेयः।  
मुहूर्तशास्त्राभरणं गुणाढ्यं विचित्रवृत्तं रुचिरं चकार॥”

 Nīlakaṇṭha was weli-versed not only in Jyotiśśāstra,but also in other branches of knowledge such as Mīmāmsā, Nyāya, Vyākarana and Vedānta and in support of this statement may be cited the following passages, among others from his Bhāṣya,

“अत एवोक्तं पार्थसारथिमिश्रेण व्याप्तिनिर्णये—  
यो यथा नियतो येन यादृशेन यथाविधः।  
स तथा तादृशस्यैव तादृशोऽन्यत्र बोधकः॥”

 In the Gaṇitapāda Bhāṣya, the author cites as authority Vṛddhagarga, Varāhamihira, Piṅgaḷa and other ancient teachers; Bhāskara, Govindasvāmi, Sūryadva, Mādhava and other later authors; Vaijayanti Gargasamhita, Sūryasiddhānta and other works; thus suggesting that his Bhāṣya was written on the line of ancient authoritative commentaries.

 His ripe scholarship on Jyotiśśāstra seasoned as it is with his close acquaintance with the works of various ancient teachers by adding to the importance of the Aryabhaṭīya, has brought lasting credit to the Kerala people. We are gratified that our desire to enrich the series by publishing more Jyotiṣa works as expressed in the introduction of the Horāśāstra (No. 91 of the Trivandrum Sanskrit Series), has now been realised to this extent.
