**PREFACE.**

 This edition of the Nareshvarapariksha is based on the collation of the following manuscripts -

 A. — Belongs to the late Pandit Sahaja Bhatta. Written on new Kashmiri paper. Mostly correct.

 B.—Belongs to Rajanaka Maheshvara of the Department. Written on old Kashmiri paper. Generally correct.

 C.— Belongs to Vasudeva Pandit of Srinagar, Kashmir. The opening & concluding portions of this manuscript are restorations, the middle portion only being the remnant of an old manuscript.

 D.— Belongs to Pandit Keshava Rajanaka of Haba Kadal, Srinagar. Written on new Kashmiri paper. Contains 67 leaves of demy octavo size. Each page of it on an average covers 21 lines of 32 letters each. It has proved to some extent of great use in correcting many passages of the book.

 The necessity of printing the unusually long errata at the end of this edition of the book is due to the fact that the manuscript D came into my hands at the time when the printing of the book was nearly completed.

 In the preparation of this book my hearty thanks are due to Pandit Rajanaka Maheshvara a well-informed Pandit of the Department.

INTRODUCTION.

 Hitherto our readers have had little or no opportunity to get an insight into the Dualistic school of the Kashmir Shaivism which is traditionally attributed to sage Amardaka, one of the disciples of famous Durvasas. Appearance of the Nareshvarapariksha with its commentary called Prakasha in the Kashmir Series of Texts & Studies is calculated to throw light on this little known school of the Kashmirian philosophy. The title of the book itself, as meaning an examination of the individual soul and the Supreme, indicates that it is a work on the Dualistic school.

Brief analysis of the contents of the text.

First Section

 In this section the author, Sadyojyotih, tries to vindicate the existence of the individual self as knower, doer & enjoyer of the fruition of his actions, and lastly as different from the Lord. In order to do that, he defeats the arguments of the upholders of the Idealistic Monism with regard to the identity of the individual self and the Lord and devotes the major portion of this part of the book to the refutation of the different views of the Buddhists who deny the existence of the soul as an abiding entity throughout one's life, nay according Atmanists even after death. The argument he uses for proving the existence of the soul is that the cognition itself constitutes the soul that experiences the variety of objects and retains their impressions in the chamber of consciousness for its future use.  

 The matter-of-fact experience that the objective world is cognised as extending in space externally suffices to maintain its existence.



On the theory of momentariness it cannot be accounted for bow the succeeding moment of cognition perceives the previous one, for, the previous moment, as being momentary, cannot linger on at the time of the succeeding one. Moreover, cognition of the blue, etc., if viewed as mere cognition apart from the blue, etc., cannot assume the function being cognised & as such cannot be perceived. In short, the object lying in front and experienced by all can never be denied.

 Difference between the cognition and the cognised is evident inasmuch as the former represents the experience itself and the latter comes within the scope of experience. The operation of the visual apparatus, such as the eyeball, etc., is required to perceive the form, etc., & hence the cognition & cognised cannot be regarded as co-existent & identical. In case, there were no such objective features as form, etc., there would be one undifferentiated cognition without the distinction of blue, etc. Therefore,. it is concluded that both the subjective & the objective factors are equally undeniable in the cognition of any kind. The self as recollecting the past experience can safely be regarded as of permanent & lasting nature. Only on the ground of permanency of the soul we can find a satisfactory explanation for the positive background of a phenomenon such as final release. In cognising a thing it is the object, not the perceiver, that possesses the form, but the form of the object helps the latter in the matter of cognition.

 That the object likewise is of permanent nature is proved by its constant identifi-



cation & recognition that this is the same object. The relation of proof and the proved would be untenable in case we do not admit the permanency of the object. Even the cognition of generality proceeds from sensuous perception, for we first try to remember the image of a previously perceived object & then determine that the object seen next time is the same. If we fail to remember & recollect, the cognition of both, the particular & the general, would be impossible.

 The theory of momentariness of the soul cannot be entertained on the ground of the impotency & uselessness of the cause that brings about destruction of a particular object. Because we see that destruction of the cause of a particular effect brings about destruction of that effect and not that that an object perishes by itself without the cause of destruction.

 Consciousness can at best be attributed only secondarily to the group of sense organs in the same manner as the idea of our personality can be extended to our children & other persons worthy of our love. The conscious element in us is not an attribute of material elements, earth, etc., of which the senses are made. It is of a nature that we do not find in the elements either separately or collectively.  

 Simultaneous experience of the two opposite feelings, pleasure and pain, by two persons at one and the same moment is a reason that debars us from arriving at the identity of individual souls. The so-called identity of individual souls would lead to the conclusion that even when one individual soul only feels pleasure or pain all must share it



equally with him – a fact which is unwarranted by actual experience.

 Although the active faculty of the soul extends over the three periods of time, past present & future, the soul remains, asa piece of magnet, unaffected by the change that an action is expected to bring over the agent. Likewise, its knowing faculty runs over three periods. There is no real difference between the knowing faculty & the conscious. The latter when manifest is believed to be the former.

 Conscious faculty is circumscribed by fetters in the case of transmigratory souls while in the case of the freed, it breaks, asunder all restraints & shines all-powerful. Omniscience and all-authorship manifest themselves in full at the time the individual soul attains to perfect freedom. The freed state cannot be regarded as something like mental torpor, for, in that case none with any ray of reason in him would long for it. The individual soul feels restraint in his powers in the ordinary course of life, but at the hour of freedom his full powers return to him undiminished.

Second Section

 In this section, the author refutes the arguments of the Mimamsakas who deny the existence of the Lord or the Architect of the universe. Their contention is that this world is never unlike this & as such does require no architect for its construction. Our author refutes them by taking his stand on the fact that the earth, etc., as being composed of parts, are to be treated as effects like a jug, etc. The oft-quoted syllogism whatever is of composed nature & inanimate shares the



nature of an effect' is used here also to prove the existence of the Lord as the author of the manifest (world). This point is developed as follows.

 The effects such as body, etc., whose doer is unknown must have some intelligent being as their maker. For we see that everywhere an effect. like a jug, etc, never exists without the agency of an intelligent cause.

 The author does not accept the defence offered by the Sankhyas & the Mimamsakas that the unevolved matter and action stand as the efficient cause of an (effect). Because he finds no reason to admit their agency on the ground that both matter & action are blind as to the motive in the accomplishment of things & are lacking wholly in free voluntary movement as they are in & out. Something admitted to be inanimate lifeless cannot when at rest be in motion without the stimulus from a conscious being.

 The question of many agents is ruled out as, according to the author, the world, though varied & multiform, tends, with all its diverse parts, to realise one central aim that its doer has in view.

 The author accounts for the period of destruction, i. e. the period of rest, in the following way. Departed souls take some time to enjoy the fruits of their actions. Matter requires some relief for its recreation. Actions of individual souls need some time to grow ripe. And consequently, the period of destruction is a natural desideratum. In other words, the period of destruction represents the time that the basic principles of the created world take to recoup their exhausted energy.



 The charge of mercilessness which human. reason brings forward against the dispensation of the Lord finds its repudiation in the karma theory so common among all schools of the Indian thought. According to it, it is not the Lord but the influence of previous actions that makes one happy and the other miserable. It proves His compassionate nature that He administers justice unto all in accordance with their actions He, though requiring the aid of time and action, etc., does not suffer in any way in His independence, for, He, as the sole agent, can exercise Hist full authority over them.

Third Section

 In this section, the author proves the inferiority of the individual soul to the Supreme Lord and alleges, for the matter of that, that the former cannot replace the latter. Though the individual soul, in the relation of paternity, is known to be the author of his offspring yet his authorship extends over the physical part only of his progeny, while he has no hand in the formation of their rational part. Moreover, the judicious arrangement of the different parts of the organic bodies is beyond the skill of the individual soul and suggests, therefore, the authorship of some extraordinary intellect. Besides, some virtuous works of remote consequence require some one to, distribute their results among their performers and hence that distributor is acknowledged as the Supreme Self.

 Thus having defined the nature of the Supreme Self, the author discusses, at length the theory of the Mimamsakas that the Vedas are eternal and as such are not the



composition of some one of extraordinary merit and rejects it in the following manner.

 Sound is a product as rice and wheat are.It owes its existence to the movement of vocal organs and such other causes without which none is able to have its sensation. Vocal organs do not bring the already existing sound material to light but fashion it altogether anew. The Vedas consist of nothing else than a collection of sound units and are therefore a product no less than a sound is. Being such, they require some one with a clear insight into the book of nature as their author, for they, though compositions, reveal some mysteries that defy the grasp of human intellect.

 The Mimamsakas are supposed to argue further against the view that the Lord composes the Vedas at the time the old world is totally destroyed and the new one is ushered in by their asserting that the theory of total destruction or creation must have some strong reason for its acceptance, otherwise no one would relish to entertain such an awful phenomenon as the total destruction is. The reply of our author to this is based on our actual observation. We see every day thousands dying and thousands born and therefore we can deduce therefrom the possibility of the period at which the universe is destroyed totally and created completely afresh.

 Moreover, the existence of the Lord is corroborated by the quotations of the revealed text and is confirmed by the vision of holy seers. Free as He is from impurities by virtue of His pristine glory, the trammels



of littleness, actions and worldly illusion do not affect Him. In corfsequence of His being uncontaminated by kala, etc., He is fas above the feelings of attachment and aversion that take their rise from them. Truly speaking, all the kalas reside in Him in their potential state and He therefore is declared as all-powerful. His absolute freedom from the effect of the three kinds of trammels, that narrow down the powers of the individual soul, leads one to infer there-  
from the probability of His having unobstructed knowledge and activity.

 Human knowledge, dependent as it is on the sense, sign and testimony, is always limited and imperfect; while that of the Lord, being independent of other agencies, does encounter no obstruction whatsoever. Thus His knowledge is above the plane of perception, etc., and stands as the substratum thereof.As the manifest world is the representation of His power and as no moment can be conceived independently of Him, it is reasonable to affirm that He is all-pervading and eternal. He is in no way engaged for self-aggrandisement. Even if He can be supposed to be engaged, it too is for the sake of man to give him the reward of his actions which otherwise would yield no fruit.

 Man, being limited always in his powers, is not in a position to achieve for himself final salvation which according to our author means the identity with the Supreme Lord. Final salvation is granted unto those who exert themselves for it. That is to say, man cannot escape the karmic fetters, unless His grace shines on him, for,



he is encompassed by them outright. The tendency of everybody is to achieve something higher and hence the state of final release. believed to be tantamount to the exalted position of the Supreme Being, finds its votaries from all quarters of the world. Those beings only are to acquire absolute emancipation who have entirely divested themselves of the threefold fetters of individuality.

 Activity of the Lord is not comparable to ours, for His mere thought suffices. for the accomplishment of everything that He thinks of. In the case of man, on the other hand, thinking and doing are two distinct phases. His thinking would not supply him with the benefits that would accrue to him from his doing. The Lord does not require any accessories as man does, for the latter as already suggested, experiences. hindrances at every step in his endeavour to accomplish a certain thing. The Lord's energy, though one in reality, manifests itself in many forms, knowing, willing and activity, according to needs and necessities. Man, whether due to his ignorance or to his wisdom, fixes a terminus of everything he thinks of and the final standard of all excellences, as conceived by him, is termed by the word God.

The Style and mentality of the author.

 The style of the author is cumbersome and of antique cast. The sense that he intends to convey is expressed in a roundabout fashion, though in some places it is clear and comprehensible with com-



parative ease. Satirical touch, though not necessarily of a higher character, is visible in his lines. For the correct understanding of the karikas the help of the commentary is indispensable as is generally the case with the works of the allied nature. The argument-action of the author is not always convincing and comprehensive. Stock syllogisms of the day are made use of. He never condemns perception, inference and other modes of knowledge as deceptive and illusory. His respect for the objective witness is as high as that for the most revered revelation. It should not be understood therefrom that subjective phenomena requiring the aid of keen and critical insight for their accurate knowledge escape his vision. He rather tries, with great success, to prove the existence of everything whether secular or otherwise by such methods as would be intelligible to all.

Nevertheless the influence of the age he lived in did not leave him unaffected. He believes not only in the extraordinary efficacy of the mantras but also in the existence of goblins and the use of magic spells. The existence of goblins is as real with him as that of domesticated animals. All that he finds and studies in the book of nature receives his due and deliberate consideration. Matter according to him has as much reality as spirit. According to him both have separately to answer their distinct purposes. Matter is the machine and the force that works within it is spirit. Without the force and the guidance of the spirit, matter will be helpless and useless.



Time and works of the author.

 We possess very scanty information about the date of the author. Nothing from so many of his known works gives us a clue to ascertain his time. We are only left to have recourse to vague conjectures as to its probable approximation. As we find that the Buddhists receive a severe thrashing at the hands of our author and are defeated their arguments more systematically more directly than any other school, we can think with some degree of certainty that our author might have lived at the time when the Buddhism was rampant in the valley of Kashmir and was trying to threaten and banish all other creeds from the land, i. e. before the eighth century A. C. Moreover, a careful juxtaposition of the style of the Nareshvarapariksha and that of some works from Shri Somananda or Utpaladeva decidedly shows the crudeness of the former as compared with the latter.

 The authorship of Sadyojyotih extends to many other works. Some of these are extant and published by the Shivagama Sangha of Madras for which we are greatly thankful to the organising body of that institute. He has written the Vritti on the Rurutantra and the Uddyota on the Swayambhuva and has reproduced their purport in a succinct form in two independent treatises of his called Tattvasangraha and Tattvatraya. The Bhogakarikas, the Mokshakarikas and the Paramokshanirasakarikas are the three other works from the same author. No work from the penof his spiritual teacher, Ugrajyotih,



whom the author mentions at the end of the work with great reverence, appears to be extant.

 About the parentage of the author we are quite in the dark. Neither the author nor his disciples have left any trace behind them to guide us to know something of the pedigree of the author at so great a distance of time that separates him from us.

Commentator Shri Ramakantha.

 Ramakantha, the commentator of the text, was the son of Narayanakantha, the author of the Mrigendravritti. In the last stanza of the Nadakarikas, Ramakantha makes a definite statement as to his own parentage. Narayanakantha, in an opening stanza of the Mrigendravritti, tells us that his preceptor was Shri Vidyakantha who was initiated into the sacred lore by his teacher Ramakantha and who ordered him (Narayanakantta) to write a small Vritti on the Mrigendra. Hence, the line of teachers stands thus:

![](../books_images/U-IMG-169884620864.png)

 It is reasonable to conjecture that Narayanakantha, out of his inestimable regard and reverence for the teacher's teacher, named his son after him.

 Ramakantha appears to have drawn freely on other logical treatises of the day with a



view to embellishing his commentary and developing the arguments employed in it. He quotes many authors some of whom are known to us only in name.

 The other works that are known to have been written by him are :

\(a\) Matangavritti, a commentary on the famousMatangatantra.  
(b) Mokshakarikavyakhya.  
(c) Paramokshanirasakarikavyakhya.  
(d) Nadakarikas.

 The present Ramakantha author of the Prakasha should not be taken to be identical with Ramakanthacarya, one of the commentators of the Spandakarikas. For no trace found in any one of the former's works that would give us some inkling however vague as to the identity of the two. Their beliefs are opposite the one being the champion of the Idealistic Monism, & the other of the Realistic Dualism. Any attempt at their identification will simply mean much fuss about nothing.

 The date of, famous Aghorashivacarya, according to the interpretation put on a couple of verses occurring in his Gotrasantatinirnaya, appears to be Shaka era 1077 corresponding to 1156 A. C. (vide p. 6 of the introduction to the Tattvaprakashika.) Therefore, for the present it can safely be said that Ramakantha whose Nadakarikas bear the commentary by Aghorashivacarya must, of course, have lived before the latter.
