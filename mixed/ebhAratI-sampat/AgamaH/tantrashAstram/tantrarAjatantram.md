**INTRODUCTION.**

 The Tantrarâja, as its name implies, is an important workof its class which is, in one of its parts, here published for thefirst time with a commentary called Manoramâ by Subhagânandanâtha of (as Bhâskararâya in his commentary on theNityâ*sh*o*d*ashikâr*n*ava says) the Kashmir school.

**** There are three sections of this Tantra each dealing witha separate Mata, that is way of regarding and worshipping the Devatâ. namely Kâdi, Hâdi, and Kahâdi, terms alluded to in my“Shakti and Shâkta” and explained later. The last portion isalso I am told called
Shaktisanggama which has four parts.Thefirst is here published, namely the Kâdimata part of Tantrarâjaconsisting of 36 Chapters of 100 verses each.

**** The manuscripts which have been used for the preparationof this Edition belong to the Asiatic Society of Bengal, theSanskrit College and Pandit Yajnapuru*sh*a respectively. To the last I am indebted for help in the preparation of this andother works. Ha is Bîja of Shiva. Ka is the first letter ofthe Bîja mantra of Kâlî or Krîng. In the Bîjâbhidânam quotedat page 321 of Pandit Jaganmohana Tarkâlangkâra's Edition of Mahânirvâna it is said :—

**Ka Kâlî Brahma ra proktam mahâmâyârthakashcha Î  
Vishvamâtrarthako nâdo bindur du*h*khâpahâraka*h*  
Tenaiva kâlikâng devîng pûjayed du*h*khashântaye**

**** When Devî asks (vv.7,8) “what is Kâdi” Shiva replies, that Kâlî and Kâdi are Shakti and that “Thy form isthe meaning of Kâdi” (Kâdisangjnâ bhavadrûpâ). Themeaning of this is that the triangle is the form of the Devî. The letter Ka written in Bengali. (ক) and generally in earlierDevanâgara forms of the letter shows a triangle in the left. According to the Var*n*oddhâra and Kâmadhenu Tantras (seeShabdakalpadruma sub. *voc*. Ka) the left line of the triangle isred Brahmâ, the right line white Vis*hn*u and the bottom line isdark green (Marakata) Rudra. The Mâtrâ is the white Sâks*h*âtSarasvati. The crooked portion on the right like a goad isthe lightning-like Ku*nd*alinî. The empty space in the triangleis the white Sudarshana shining like millions of moons and withHim is Kâli the grantor of Kaivalya and in the three cornersare Jye*shth*â, Vâmâ and Raudrî Shaktîs. This Triko*n*a is



known as the Yonima*nd*ala which is the seat (Âsana) of Tripurâ Devî. She is Jnânâtmâ in whom are the four Kalâs and as thecollectivity of Jnâna, Ichchhâ, Kriyâ, She is the Mûrtimân Prak*rit*i. From Kakâra comes Kâma. It is the Mûlaprak*ri*ti ofall Var*n*as and the imperishable Power of Blossom (Sphuradavyaya) the Mother of all Devas and the Giver of Liberation.In Chhândogya Upani*sh*ad (4-10-5) it is said “Kang Brahma”; “Ka is Brahma.” It is that Shakti Which being spread by means of the nine Nâthas (the means of experience—ears (2)mouth, eyes (2) nostrils (2) penis and anus) manifests throughout the earth Kalpa after Kalpa, and at the end of the Kalpathey and She return to him (Sâ tai*h* sârddham brajechchamâm). Shiva and Shakti are one and where one is worshippedthe other is worshipped. Sammohana Tantra (Chapter 1) saysKâdimata is that Mata in which the Mantras begin with Ka. In Hâdi they begin with Ha. It is also called Hangsarâja. Kahâdi is formed by the union of Kâdi and Hâdi which isUttarâmnâyagochara. Kulâr*n*ava, which is Ûrddhvâmnâya, isI have been told the highest Tantra in Kahâdi-mata.

 The Tantras of the Kâdi class are according to the presentText nine in number and are according to the Manoramâ :—Sundarî*hr*idaya, Nityà*sh*odashikâ*rn*ava, (published in Vol. 56of Ânandâshrama Sanskrit Texts) Chandrajnâna. Mât*ri*kâ, Sammohana, Vâmakeshvara, Bahurûpâ*shta*ka, Prastârachintâma*n*i, and Meruprastâra.

Bhâskararâya, the learned Commentator on various Tântrikand Aupanis*h*âdic texts, questions the accuracy of the Manoramâ on this point in his Setubandha which is a Commentaryof his on the Nityâ*sh*odashikâr*n*ava. He there says that theNityâ*sh*odashikâ is part of the Vâmakeshvara Tantra and theSundar*î* or Yoginîh*ri*daya is a part of the former. The threetherefore make one Tantra. He also says in the same Commentary that the Bahurûpâ*sht*aka is not one “Tantra but eight named after the seven Mât*ris* beginning with Brâhmî¸ andShivadûti. I may here observe that if the SammohanaTantra be counted as one of the nine it cannot be the Tantraof that name published by Rasika Mohana Chattopâdhyâyafor that is a Vai*sh*nava Tantra and a fragment of a work consisting of 40.000 verses. A copy of another work of the samename was supplied to me from the collection of Mahâmahopâdhyâya Vindhyeshvarîprasâda Divedî and copies are said to be available in Nepal of this Tantra which is a Kâdi Tantraand therefore it must be to this and not to the published Sammohana that the Manoramâ refers.



 The Kâdi Tantras give detailed injunctions touching theworship of Shakti in Her various forms : such worship beingeither gross (Sthûla) subtle (Skû*sh*ma) or supreme (Para). Naturally the Sâdhaka begins with the first and the ritual takesthe Sâdhaka up to the highest. The aim and object is thepractical realization of the truths of the Advaita Vedânta.

 Tripurasundarî or Lalitâ has three aspects (Rûpa). Sthûla, Sûk*sh*ma, Para. The ritual of Her worship is also of threekinds, Kâyika by body, Vâchika by speech and Mânasa bymind, also called Bâhyayâga, Antaryâga, and Bhâvanâ.

 This Tantra gives all the three forms whereby the Sâdhakais led by his Guru through ascending stages to Advaita Siddhi. The Guru is one with Âdyâ Shakti Vimarshamayî the cause ofall. The ninefoldness of his body is seen in the nine apertures.

  **Gururâdyâ bhavechchhaktik*h*sâ vimarshamayî matâ  
 Navatvang tasya dehasya randhratvenâvabhâsate**

 The nine Gurus are in the form of the nine apertures. Thebody of the Sâdhaka is the Shrichakra which consists of nineChakras. The object of worship of the Shrichakra is therealisation of the inseparateness (Abhedabhâvanâ) of Jnâtâwhich is Hotâ, of Jnâna which is Arghya and of Jneya whichis Havi*h*.



**Jnâtâsvâtmâ bhavejjnînam arghyang jneyang havi*h*sthitam  
Shrichakrapûjanang tes*h*âm ekikara*n*am îritam.**

The scheme of Sâdhanâ and the different parts of the Shrîchakraare explained in the Vâsanâ Pa*t*ala (Ch. XXXV) of this work. The Tripurâtâpinî Upanis*h*ad deals with Kâyika and VâchikaKarma and the Bhâvanopani*sh*ad with Bhâvanâor MânasaKarma. This last Upani*sh*ad summarises in the main theVâsanâ Pa*t*ala of the Tantrarâja and begins with the Sûtra “Shrîguru*h* sarvakâra*n*abhûtâ shakti*h*” ending with “Bhâvanâparo jîvanmukto bhavati. ”

 In order to follow the ritual of this work it is necessary tounderstand the Shrîyantra figured on the cover of this volume. This celebrated Yantra represents the human body and thewhole universe and man (for what is in the former is in thelatter and *vice versa*) as also the Shiva-Shakti Svarûpa orÂtmâ. It is thus the symbol of the Devî as She is in Her ownform (Svarûpa) and as She is in the form of the universe



(Vishvâtmâ). The account here given is taken from the Text, which account agrees with that given in other Kâdi Tantrassuch as Yoginîh*ri*daya and Nityâ*sh*o*da*shikâr*n*ava and with theBhâvanopani*sh*ad which is an Upani*sh*ad of the Kâdimata.

 The Yantra is composed of nine triangles and Chakras onewithin the other until the central point or Bindu is reached.In each of the nine Chakras the Devî is worshipped in its centreunder one of Her nine names united with the Pâdukâ Mantraof seven letters. The nine triangles are four with points upwards that is the Shrîka*nth*as or Shiva element, and the fivedownward pointed triangles or Shivayuvatîs, the Shaktielement. All are formed by the Mûlaprak*ri*ti of the Shiva-bindu, the ninth being the Mûlaprak*ri*ti, and the eight theVik*ri*tis which in relation to their productions are Prak*ri*ti. The nine Chakras also represent S*rishti* (Creation) Sthiti (Maintenance) and Sanghâra (Absorbtion) each set of three beingformed of the combinations S*risht*i-S*risht*i, S*risht*i-Sthiti, S*risht*i-Sanghâra; Sthiti-S*risht*i, Sthiti-Sthiti, Sthiti-Sanghâra;Sanghâra-S*risht*i, Sanghâra-Sthiti, Sanghâra-Sanghâra. The object of the worship is, as the Bhâvanopani*sh*ad says (Sûtra 10),the realisation of the unity of Jnâtâ, Jnâna, Jneya (Jnât*ri*j*n*âna-jneyânâmabhedabhâvanam) which is the aim and object of everyAdvaitin. The nine Chakras are (1) Bhûpura (2) sixteenpetals (3) eight petals (4) first set of fourteen angles (5) secondset of ten inner angles (6) third set of ten angles within these(7) fourth set of eight angles within these (8) three angleswithin these and (9) the point or Bindu. These are called (commencing with the first above named or outermost) Trailokyamohana, Sarvâshâparipûraka. Sarvasangk*sh*obha*n*a, Sarvasaubhâgyadâyaka. Sarvârthasâdhaka, Sarvarogahara, Sarvarak*sh*âkara, Sarvasiddhiprada and Sarvânandamaya.

 There are two ways in which the Shrîyantra may bedescribed. We may start from the outer Chakra and workinwards which is called Layakrama, or commence with theBindu and work outwards. The latter which is called S*risht*i krama, is here adopted. The central Bindu or the Supremeunited Kâmeshvara and Kâmeshvarî is the Devî Tripurâ orLalitâ Who is Âtmâ whether as Jîvâtma in bodies or as thebodiless Paramâtmâ. For Kâmeshvara is the Supreme Samvitwithout Upâdhi and Kâmeshvarî is His Shakti. This Binduis in the innermost triangle or All-blissful
(Sarvânandamaya)Chakra. The word Yoni in this worship does not mean thegenerative organ of a woman but means Kâra*n*am or Cause, the Womb of the Universe. This Bindu is threefold (Bindu-



traya) one above being the face of the Devî and the twobelow Her Breasts. This is symbolism of worship in which inIndia as elsewhere
anthropomorphic forms are employed, thoseforms being those seen by the worshippers of the race. Moreabstractedly the three Bindus are Sun, Moon and Fire; not theluminaries or element so called but names given to the Prakâshaand Vimarsha aspects of the Parabindu differentiating to create the Universe, such aspects being again symbolised by the singleand double Bindus the Anusvàra and Visarga breathingsrespectively. The worship of Lalitâ is a part of Shrîvidyâ. Lalitâ is also called the Adyâ or Angginityâ Devatâ Who isSat and Ânanda and Pur*n*â and around Her as Angga orÂvara*n*a Devatâs are the fifteen Nityâ Devatâs or Devisrepresenting the five Bhûtas with their fifteen Gu*n*as or (as oneaccount goes) the three Gu*n*as Sattva, Rajas, Tamas.

 The number ‘15’ is got by dealing with each of the Bhûtasfrom their Sattva, Rajas, Tamas aspects or by addition of theGu*n*as of the Bhûtas themselves. In the triangle surroundingthe Devî are the nine Lords or Nâthas. These are the nineapertures which exist both in the cosmic and individual bodiesnamely the two Eyes and mouth (Divyaugha) the two ears andPenis (Siddhaugha) and the two Nostrils and Anus(Mânavaugha).

 Lalitâ is the Vimarsha Shakti of Prakâsha Shiva. Lalitâ isred; for in the 28th Sutra of the Bhâvanopani*sh*ad it is said“Redness is the Vimarsha of all this (Lauhityam etasyasarvasya vimarsha*h*) By ‘Sarvasya’ is meant, as Bhâskararâyasays in his commentary on the Bhâvanopani*sh*ad, Kâmeshvara, Lalitâ, and the Sâdhaka's self. Râga and redness are one.It is said that “One's Âtmâ is Devi Lalitâ Whose bodyis the universe (Vishvavigrahâ). Redness is Her Vimarshaand worship is the meditation on this.” The Bindu issurrounded by a triangle or the Siddhiprada Chakra. At the corners of this triangle which is the Second Chakraare the Shaktis (distinct from the Nityâs of that name)Kâmeshvari (to be distinguished both from SupremeKâmashvarî and the Nityâ Kâmeshvarî) Vajreshvarî and Bhagamâlini who are Avyakta or Prak*ri*ti, Mahat the CosmicBuddhi and Ahangkâra. The three corners are the Pi*th*asKâmarûpa, Pûr*n*agiri, Jâlandhara. In the centre isAu*dd*iyânaPitha the Shripâdukà Mantra being “Hûng,Shrîng, Samastâm Mûlavidyâm, Au*dd*iyânapi*th*e Shrimahâtripurasun-DevîShripâdukâm pûjayâmi Nama*h*.” In the spaces outside thistriangle are the five Tanmâtras which are the five arrows of



Kâma, Manas. the sugar-cane bow of Kâma Râga which is hisnoose and Dve*sh*a which is his goad.

 The third Chakra (Sarvarak*sh*âkara) is composed of eightangles being the first eight angles formed by the intersectionof the triangles other than that already described which areVashinî, Kâmeshvarî, Mohinî, Vimalâ, Aru*n*â, Jayinî, Sarveshvarî and Kaulinî which are Devatâs of Cold (Shîta) Heat(U*shn*a) Happiness (Sukha) Pain (Du*h*kha) Desire (Ichchhâ)and Sattva, Rajas, Tamas. At this stage the Sâdhaka strivesto control the Gunas and to be unaffected by the Dvandvas.

 The fourth or Sarvarogahara Chakra is composed of tenangles presided over by the ten Shaktis Sarvajnâ, Sarvashoktipradâ. Sarvaishvaryyapradâ. Sarvajnânamayî, Sarvavyâdhivinâshinî, Sarvâdhârâ. Sarvapâpaharâ Sarvânandamayî, Sarvarak*sh*â, Sarvepsitaphalapradâ. These are the Devatâs of thefunctions of the vital fire (Vahnikalâ) which are Rechaka (elimination) Pâchaka (Digestion) Sho*sh*aka (that which removes theDo*sh*a of Ja*th*arâgni) Dâhaka (burning) Plâvaka (flooding, thatis spreading of Rasa which helps Ja*th*arâgni) K*sh*âraka (bilesecreting) Udgâraka (belching). K*sh*obhaka (churning of thefood) J*r*imbhaka (yawning) Mohaka that which causes painand fainting.

 The fifth outer Chakra Sarvârthasâdhaka of ten angles ispresided over by the Devis Sarvasiddhipradâ, Sarvasampatpradâ, Sarvapriyangkarî, Sarvamangalakârinî, Sarvakâmapradâ Sarvadu*h*khavimochanî, Sarvam*ri*tyuprashamanî, Sarvavighnanivârinî, Sarvângasundarî, Sarvasaubhâgyydâyinî. These arethe Devîs of the ten Prâ*n*as which are controlled by theirworship.

 The sixth Chakra (Sarvasaubhâgyadâyaka) has fourteenangles in which are the Shaktis Sarvasangk*sh*obhi*n*î, Sarvavidrâvi*n*î, Sarvâkar*sh*i*n*î, Sarvâhlâdinî, Sarvasammohanî, Sarvastambhini, Sarvajambhinî, Sarvavashangkari, Sarvaranjanî, Sarvonmâdinî, Sarvârthasâdha*n*î, Sarvasampattipûranî, Sarvamantramayî, Sarvadvandvak*sh*ayangkarî, who are the Âdhidevatâs of the fourteen principal Nâ*d*is vis: Alambu*sh*â, KuhûVishvodarâ, Vâra*n*â, Hastijihvâ, Yashovatî, Payasvini, Gândhârî, Pûs*h*â, Shangkhinî, Sarasvatî, *Î*dâ, Pinggalâ andSus*h*umnâ.

 The seventh Chakra is the eight petalled Sarvasang*sh*obha*n*a Chakra which surrounds the circle in which the other



triangles mentioned are placed.The Devîs here are Ananggakusumâ , Ananggamekhalâ, Ananggamadanâ, Ananggamadanâturâ. Ananggarekhâ, Ananggaveginî, Ananggamadanângkushâ, Ananggamâlini, which are Devatâs of the Buddhi of speech (Vachana) grasping (Âdâna) walking (Gamana) excretingor rejecting (Visarga) pleasurable feeling (Ânanda) relinquishment(Hâna) concentration (Upâdâna) and detachment (Upek*sh*â).

 Outside this again is a lotus of sixteen petals which is theSarvâshâ paripûraka Chakra. Here are sixteen Shaktisnamely :-Kâmâkar*sh*anî, Buddhyâkar*sh*ani. Ahangkârâkar*sh*a*n*î, Shabdâkar*sh*anî, Sparshâkar*sh*anî, Rûpâkar*sh*a*n*î, Rasâkar*sh*a*n*î, Gandhâkar*sh*a*n*î, Chittâkar*sh*a*n*î, Dhairyâkar*sh*a*n*î, Sm*ri*tyâkar*sh*a*n*î, Nâmâkar*sh*a*n*i, Bijâkar*sh*a*n*î, Âtmâkar*sh*a*n*î, Amritâkar*sh*a*n*î, Sharîrâkar*sh*a*n*i, who are Devatâs of the attainment of the object of desire by, in particular, the acquisition and strengthening (as regards the self) and the control (as regards others of powers over Buddhi, Ahangkâra, Shabda (such ashearing at a distance) Sparsha, Rûpa, Rasa, Gandha, Chitta, stead-fastness, memory; name (attraction by saying), growth, the subtle body, revivification, and the gross body.These Siddhis are acquired by worship in the Chakra.

  Outside the sixteen petals in the surrounding space ofthe Bhûpura are (see Bhâvanopani*sh*ad S. 12) the tenMudrâshaktis namely Sarvasang*sh*obhi*n*î, Sarvavidrâvi*n*î, Sarvâkar*sh*a*n*î, Sarvâveshakâri*n*î, Sarvonmâdinî, Mahângkushâ, Khechari, Bîjamudrâ, Mahâyoni, and Trikha*nd*ikâ. The firstnine Mudrâs belong to the nine Chakras of the Shrî-Yantrarespectively, the tenth being above all. The nine MudrâShaktis represent, that is are shaped into the form of, the nineÂdhâras other than the last which is above all. Bhâskaratâyasays : the nine Âdhâras are the six Chakras Mûlâdhâra andthe rest, and the two Lotuses of a Thousand Petals and Lambikâgra, a centre approximately below the eyes and behind the nose.

 Outside the sixteen petals are four circular lines containingthree circular spaces.The outer circle is on the same levelwith the sixteen petalled, eight petalled, and first outer fourteen angled Chakras and connected with these Chakras. The middle circle is on the level and connected with these Chakras.The middle circle is on the level and connected with the twosets of ten angles and the eight angles; and the innermostcircle is on the same level and connected with the inner Chakraof three angles.



 Outside these and on the outermost line of the Bhûpura are worshipped the ten Siddhis, A*n*imâ and the rest. These in the Manoramâ are said to be not different from (Abheda)Niyati and the nine Rasas. Four are at the doors, one ateach ; four at the corners, one at each, and one is above and one below. At the middle line the eight Mât*ri*kâs are worshipped, four at the doors and four at the corners. These are Brâhmî, Mâheshvarî, Kaumârî, Vai*shn*avî, Vârâhî, Indrâ*n*îChâmu*nd*â, and Mahâlak*sh*mî, considered as constituted ofKâma (Kâmamaya) Krodha, Lobha, Moha, Mada, Mâtsaryya, Pâpa and Pû*n*ya. Brâhmî is conjoined with Kâma becauseShe creates, Mâheshvarî with Krodha because She 'destroys' Kaumâri with Lobha because, being youthful, She is full oflonging, Vai*shn*avî with Moha because She fascinates theUniverse by Her Moha, Vârâhî with Mada because the boaris an obstinate and proud animal (‘pigheaded’), Indrâ*n*î withMâtsaryya because Indra Her consort is a jealous Devatâ, Châmundâwith Pâpa because by and through Her mediationinjury is done, Lak*sh*mî with Pû*n*ya because She is benignand leads the Sâdhaka to all virtuous acts. On the inner lineof the Bhûpura the ten Dikpâlas are worshipped, placed in thesame way as the Siddhis. These Mudrâ Shaktis, DikpâlasMât*ri*kâs, and Siddhis constitute the ninth Chakra calledTrailokyamohana. The Siddhis are first worshipped for selfprotection during Sâdhanâ. The Mât*ri*kâs are worshipped tosuppress all evil inclinations associated with each of their namesand to gain virtue, and the Dikpâlâs for protection of theSâdhaka and his Sâdhanâ. The Bhûpura is that in which thewhole Yantra is placed. The Tantrarâja says that after worship in manner enjoined let the Sâdhoka consider himself aslike unto Devî (Svâtmânang tatsamang smaret) and one withDevî (Devyâtmâ). He is then happy.

 Let us then consider the principle involved in this worship. Tântrik Sâdhana is based on a very profound knowledge ofthe principles of psychology. The object here is the realization of the unity of the Jîvâtmâ with the Mother or Devî. Now one may tell a Chela that this is the fact without anything more following from such mere instruction. The truth is notrealised by mere oral instruction but by action following it. If the Chela were to call the statement in question the answerof the Guru would not be a mere philosophical argument thoughreasoning has its place, but a direction to do certain things withthe statement that the achievement of them will produce bothcapacity for the actual knowledge required. How? No onecan really know any spiritual truth except he personally



experiences it. Until then it merely remains an instructionfor the mind which, though based on Scriptural authorityis evidence of a secondary character. What is sought isnot a mere statement of fact however true it may be but thatactual experience which it indicates and to which it leads. The mind must then be first prepared to fully receive andthen realise the truth taught. Such preparation consists inplacing before it successively and continuously the idea thatevery thing which exists in nature and therefore in the human body is, from the Devatâ aspect, a Shakti. The universe isthe body of the Mother as the Lord of all. But all is Shaktîwhether as the Mother in Her Supreme Self (Svarûpa) or in the form of every object in the universe. Matter is not something wholly apart from Spirit or God. It is an aspect assumedby Spirit. Further as “all this is Brahman” every single thingor person is Brahman in that particular form.The BrahmanSvarûpa is pure Spirit and its Power or Shaktî which manifestsas the Universe is that same Spirit in material forms. But thematter also of these forms is Shakti for there is nothing butShakti anywhere in anything which is apparent to us.Therefore Mind and Senses in their varying forms are each in theirDevatâ aspect particular Shaktis, that is the whole Universeis informed by, and is the manifestation of, Spirit, but a particularly named Devatâ is that Spirit in the particular manifestation to which the name is given. Thus the Brahman or Shiva Shakti is the name of the Universal Spirit. But Shakti inthat aspect in which It exists at rest in the Mûlâdhâra as thestatic centre round which all the bodily forces revolve is calledKu*nd*alinî Devî. Shakti as the source of, and manifesting as, the vital functions is Prâ*n*ashakti and each again of thesefunctions is a separate Shakti, that is the general Shakti manifesting Herself in that particular way. The Sâdhaka is taughtto realise this in his worship. He looks upon each part of andfunction of his body as a Shakti or Devatâ, or more simply inearlier stages as presided over by a Devatâ (Adhi*shth*âtrî Devatâ). An elementary view is to regard, say, the Mind assomething apart, over and governing which is a Devatâ orShakti. The more experienced and correct view is that theMind *is* Shakti, that is a particular manifestation of It. Bycontinual and repeated practice in Chakra after Chakra everything thus become *divinised*. It is seen not as gross and socalled inert matter but as what it is, namely Brahman or Shaktiin that form. It is so seen because the Mind by constant andearnest association of the Divine with the Universe familiarisesitself with, and then realises, the fact. Everything is thus aparticular Shakti. The next step is to realise that all these



particular Shaktis are, as it were, fragments of the one Powerwhich is the Primordial Divine Power (Âdyâ Shakti) and thirdly that the Sâdhaka himself both in his essential nature (Âtmâ or Spirit) and in his mind and body (particular aspects ofShakti) is one with that Supreme Shakti which is the end ofall Vedântic monistic teaching (Advaitavâda) Sâ, ham “She I am” The Sâdhaka worships all forms as particular Shaktis. He is then led up from lower to higher forms of Shakti until heplaces before himself for worship the Supreme Power Who isboth the Mother of all these particular Shaktis and Whoappears in, and as, them. For there is nothing but the oneMother. As the human father is reborn in his son so theMother Who creates the Universe Herself enters into it. Shemakes and is the form in which She in Her formless aspectabides. Thus to take the particular example under discussion theSâdhaka in the outermost Chakra meditates (in connection withDevatâ) upon forms of sin and virtue, the emotions and thendesire, the mind and senses, the Nâ*d*îs, the vital airs and fires, the Manas, Tanmâtra., Râga, Dve*sh*a, Ahangkâra, Buddhi, Prak*ri*ti and the Bhûtas of which the Devîs are the fifteenNityâs who are parts of the body (as indeed are all the rest) of the Supreme Shakti Tripurasundarî or Lalitâ Devî fromWhom they emanate. The Devî as Kâmeshvarî is one withKâmeshvara and the Sâdhaka thinks of himself as one withDevî. The Chhândogya Upani*sh*ad says that as one thinks so he becomes. Practice of the ritual transforms the mind itself andwhat is at first seen merely as external Yantra with lines, curvesand petals becomes a pure mental state in the Sâdhaka himself. He too is a Shrî-Yantra and he realises himself as such. Thisrealisation is not to be had by mere discussion (Vichâra) butby the practical methods of the spiritual discipline enjoined. In the same way for the Tântrik methods are everywhere substantially the same though the forms vary) the Sâdhaka in the Buddhist Demchog (Mahâsukha) Tantra, which I am aboutto publish, meditates on the Ma*nd*ala of the Devatâ. He theDevatâ as method (Thabs or Upâya) which is compassion(Karu*n*â) is united with His spouse the Mahâyoginî Who is wisdom (Shesrab or Jnâna) which is the Void or Shûnyatâ. Around these “two in one” are Âvara*n*a Devatâs which form part of the Body of the Supreme Devatâ in whom by meditation they are merged and the Sâdhaka unites himself with themand him according to the doctrines of the “not two” wisdom (Nyismed yeshes) that is Advaita. So also the object ofworship of the Indian Shrî-Chakra is the realisation of theinseparateness of Jnâtâ which is Hotâ. of Jnâna which isArghya, and of Jneya which is Havi*h*.



 The following is a short analysis of the Chapters of the work here published.

 *Chapter I*. This begins with a prayer followed by a request made by Devî̂ of Shiva that He should declare to Her anindependent Tantra of the sixteen Nityâ Devatâs, because thenine then existing Tantras, through their interdependence, were the cause of confusion. That is none of these Tantras werecomplete and Devî wished to have a Tantra which should beall-inclusive. There would then be no necessity to have recourse to any other. Shiva in reply gives the meaning of Kâdi, a summary of the contents of the Tantra, the marks of theright Guru and Shi*sh*ya, the mode of worshipping the Guru andthe manner of selection of a Mantra, though He adds that this is not necessary in the case of Mantras of the Nityâs. Vv. 68-71 speak of the men who are qualified to gain Siddhi. V. 72defines the terms Yoga Pallava, Sampu*t*a. Grathana andVidarbha as applied to Jap of Mantra. This is followed bynine verses enumerating twenty-five defects (Do*sh*a) ofMantras which it is the duty of the Guru to remove beforegiving the Mantra to the disciple. Vv. 82, 83 state the dutyof the Guru to be to teach the disciple the making of theYonimudrâ and to give him Vîryyayojanâ of Mantra. This means imparting to the disciple the power (Vîryya) of theMantra: a process which is given in some detail in Ch. XXXV but can be only fully learnt of the Guru. Thelatter should (the verses continue) protect the disciple andteach him the meaning of the first and last letters of theMât*ri*kâs. Without this the letters are like the autumnclouds which come and go without fruit of useful rain. V. 84 says that the knowledge of this is Ahangk*ri*ti, from whichAhangkâra man becomes like unto Shiva (Matsamo jâyatenara*h*), Ahangk*ri*ti or Ahangkâra literally means the makingof or realization of “I”. The union of A the first letter andHa the last letter makes Aham = I, which contains within it all the letters of the alphabet and is therefore in the terms ofMantra the full expression of the Self. The union of the firstand last letters of the Mât*ri*kâ is Tâdâtmya-siddhi the receptacle of the sense of all Mantras. Through it is realised theidentity of the Sâdhaka with the Mât*ri*kâ and the Devatâs who are the Artha thereof VV. 96-100 contain the following :—



*HYMN TO THE GURU.*

Obeisance to Thee Oh Lord Oh Bhagavân  
Thou art Shiva Whose nature is auspicious (Shiva)  
It is Thou who hast devised the various modes  
Whereby knowledge (Vidyâ) descends.  
Thou art ever nine  
Thy form is of nine aspects  
Thou art the Sun which dispels the darkness of ignorance  
Thou art free (Svatantra) and Massive Consciousness(Chidghana)  
Mercy is Thy form  
And Thou art all good (Shivâtmâ)  
Thou art the support of the devotee  
And the being of all that are  
Thou art the Viveka of the Vivekins  
And the Vimarsha of the Vimarshins (1)  
Thou art the revelation of all revelations  
And the Jnâna of all Jnânins  
I bow to Thee as in front of me, as on either side of me  
As behind me, as below me, and as above me  
Grant me this that Thou hast Thy abode ever in my mind.

  *Chapter II.* This deals with the Ma*nd*ala of the nineNâthas or Lords who are enumerated in vv. 2-5. The Divyaugh (two ears and mouth) are Prakâshânanda, Vimarshânanda and Ânandânanda. The Siddhaugha (eyes andpenis) are Shri Jnânânanda, Shrî Satyânanda and Shrî Pûrnâ*n*anda. The Mânavaugha (two nostrils and anus) are Svabhâva, Pratibha and Subhaga. The first class ever abide withShiva (Madantike nityam) the second both near Him and onearth (Bhûmâvihâpi cha) and the third on earth (Bhûmâvevasatatâng nivasanti). They are all Shiva (Madâtmaka) in varying aspect. By their help the Kâdishakti Who is inseparatefrom Shiva revealed the fullness of the Tantrashâstra onearth in the K*ri*ta Yuga. They are described as beautifulforms having two arms, two eyes, smiling and of gracious mien, making with their hands the gestures (Mudrâ) of granting favours and dispelling fear. So they should be worshipped in their respective Mandalas (v. 8).

(1) That is the knowledge of the difference of the “I” and “This” (Ahantâ and Idantâ) and of the manner in which they are yet one. Vimarsha is the object and Vimarshin is the “I” which perceives it.



 VV. 12-16 give the Pâdukâ mantra of seven letters. Then follow the names of sixteen letters of the nine Nâthas whoare one with the sixteen Nityâ Devatâs (*Sh*o*d*ashanityâtmâ). Instructions follow for the drawing of the Ma*nd*ala and worshipof the Guru. Vv. 37-38 state the length of time a discipleshould be tested before initiation is given to him. Vv. 39-43 speak of the three modes of Prati*shth*â (placing of the Devî)which may be in the Chakra (that is the Lalitârchâchakra), in the disciple, or in the image of Devî : as also of the time whenthis should be done. It is the Siddhâtmâ(*i.e.* Tattvavit) andnot the man proud of his knowledge (Jnânagarbita) who shoulddo this. He who performs it without the permission of hisGuru either in ignorance or prompted by hope of gain goes withwife and child to Hell. Vv. 44-51 speak of the Prati*shth*â ofthe Shrichakra and other connected rites. (The above arefollowed by 25 verses which occur in one of the Texts but arenot noticed or commented upon by the Manoramâ. Thesehave not been numbered). Vv. 52-57 lay down the rules forinstructing a good disciple. Fifteen verses beginning with v. 58describe two kinds of Abhi*sh*eka and their respective merits.In these nine gems are put into medicated water of one Khâri(=4096 pala) namely ruby (Padmarâga) pearl (Muktâ) coral(Pravâla) cat's-eye (Vaiduryya) topaz (Pu*sh*parâja) diamond(Vajra) sapphire (Nila) cow's fat stone called Gomeda, emerald(Marakata). These gems represent the nine component partsof the human body namely, chyle (Rasa) flesh (Mângsa) skin(Tvak) blood (Rudhira) semen (Shukra) marrow (Majjâ) bone(Asthi) fat (Meda). Vv. 73-74 enjoin that daily worship beperformed thrice (Sandhyâtraya-bhajana) and speak of Kâmyanyâsavidhi. Vv. 75-79 prescribe the auspicious periods forAbhi*sh*eka, and the following four verses the worship of theGuru and other rites. Vv. 84-85 give the articles to be used inthe making of the Guru Ma*nd*ala. Vv. 88-98 contain a Stotraof Mât*ri*kâ Devi which also occurs in Chapter I of the Nityâ*sh*o*d*ashikâr*n*ava. In its interpretation of this Stotra theManoramâ follows the Kashmir School. Bhâskararâya differs from it in some particulars.

 *Chapter III.* From the Sâdhaka's standpoint this is ofgreat importance for it gives the Mantras of the sixteen Nityâs. These are Âdyâ or Angginityâ Devatâ and the other fifteenor Anggas are described by Bhâskararâya as like unto, and raysof, the Âdyâ Nityâ Herself. She alone is united with Kâmeshvara, in this differing from the remaining Nityâs, who inother respects resemble Her (see p. 25 Nityâshodashikâr*n*ava). Kâmeshvara is defined in the 26th Sûtra of Bhâvanopani*sh*ad



as ‘Nirupâdhika-sangvideva Kâmeshvara*h*,’ that is Samvit without Upâdhis; and Lalitâ as the supreme Kâmeshvarî is 'Sadânandapûrna*h* svâtmaiva paradevatâ Lalitâ,' that is one's selfis Pûr*n*a, Sat and Ânanda (ib 27). She is in the centre of theShrî Yantra which is Sarvânandamaya. The Mantra of ÂdyâNityâ is (vv. 3-5) H*ri*t (=S) Prâ*n*a (=K) Ilâ (=L) Hangsa(=H) Dâha (=R) Vahni (=Î) Khang (=Bindu). H canbe placed in the beginning, middle or end. By changing itsposition the other Mantras are obtained. H at the end is appropriate for Mukti and elsewhere for prosperity (Sampat). The Mantras of the other Nityâs are given in vv. 6-72.

 Âdyâ Nityâ is Vimarsha Shakti that is the Shakti ofPrakâsha Shiva. Shiva is Prakâsha and Vimarsha Shakti is inthe language of the Kâmakalâvilâsa “the pure mirror in whichHe reflects Himself.” (Pratiphalati vimarshadarpa*n*e vishade). It is in this mirror which is another aspect of Himself that He knows Himself as the universe. It is this supreme “I” (Parâhantâ) which is the seed of all multiple world experience. According to this Tantra, the Âdyâ Nityâ or Vimarsha Shaktibecomes fivefold in the Bhûtas, ether, air, fire, water, earth, andby association of each of these with the three Gu*n*as, there are the fifteen Nityâs which are rayed forth from Her (Ekaikagu*n*ab*ri*ddhyâ tu tithisangkhyâtvamâgatâ). The number 15 isalso got in another way that is by Vyavakarana or arithmeticalprogression of the number of the Gu*n*as of the five Bhûtas, Âkâshahaving one, Vâyu two, and so on until we get to P*ri*thîvî whichhas five. The addition of these gu*n*as makes fifteen. In the Subhagodaya it is said that the fifteen minor Nityâs are theKalâs of the fifteen Tithis beginning with Pratipat of the lighthalf of the lunar month and ending with the Pûr*n*imâ and thesixteenth that is Âdyâ is Sachchidânandarûpi*n*î. The 33rdSûtra of the Bhâvanopani*sh*ad says “Panchadashatithirûpe*n*akâlasya pari*n*âmâvalokanam.” Bhâskarâya in his commentary onthis Sûtra says that the Prapancha or Universe is of three kinds, Kâla (Time) and De*sh*a (Space) and that which isthe union of both. “Realising the evolution of time throughthe fifteen letters” is thus the dissolution of the externalworld in one's Âtmâ, as is shown in Ch. XXXV of thepresent work.

**Tithirûpe*n*a kâlasya pari*n*âmâvalokanam**  
**Nityâ*h* panchadashaitâ*h* syur iti proktâscha vâsanâ*h***

 Verses 73-87 give the Mantras of Vârâhî and verse 88 thefive names of Varâhî which are Vârâhî, Panchami, Vishvavijayâ



Bhadrakaumadi and Vârtâlî. In vv. 89-93 is found the Mantra of Kurukullâ.

 Vârâhî is fatherhood (Pit*r*irûpâ) and Kurukullâ is motherhood. They are outside the Nityâs and a Chapter is devotedto them.

** **Bhâvanopani*sh*ad says (5) :—

  “Vârâhi pit*ri*rûpî kurukullâvalî devatâ mâtâ”; and thisTantra says:

**Balidevya*h* svamâyâ*h* syu*h* panchami janakâtmikâ  
Kurukullâ bhaven mâtâ puru*sh*ârthâstu sâgarâ*h***

 Panchamî here mentioned is Vârâhî who is Janakâtmikâ andKurukullâ is mother. Though Vârâhî is female she is yet Pit*ri*rûpà Her aspect being male (Pungrûpâ). She is the Devatâ ofBone (Asthi) which a child gets from its father and Kurukullâ is the Devatâ of flesh (Mângsa) which it receives from itsmother.

 Vv. 94-95 give the Prapanchayâga Mantra and v. 96 theMantras of each of the five Bhûta.

 *Chapter IV.* This and the two following Chapters dealwith the rites relating to the Âdyâ Nityâ Lalitâ. The Compilerof the Catalogue of Mss in Nepal seems to have been insufficiently acquainted with the Mss he described. Thus he incorrectly says that the third Chapter is devoted to this subject. In his summary of the sixteen Nityâs he leaves out three of them(namely Vahnivâsinî, Sarvamangalâ, and Jvâlâmâlinî andwrongly includes Vârâhî and Kurukullâ amongst the Nityâsand repeats the name of Nityâ twice as the first and eleventh. He makes no mention of the Shrîchakra the important part of this work nor deals with the XXXVth Chapter which gives its philosophy. He states, in some cases incorrectly, the namesof the nine Nâthas on the authority of the late Librarian, NepalDarbar though the names are correctly given in the Ms. described. He confuses the nine Nâthas here described with Âdinâtha, Ka*nth*anâtha and other recognised Avatâras of Shiva.

 The fourth Chapter begins with Karashuddhividyâ,
*Sh*a*d*angganyâsavidyâ Devyâtmâsanavidyâ, Chakrâsanavidyâ, Sarvamantrâsanavidyâ, Sâdhyasiddhâsanavidyâ, Âvâhanavidyâ.



 Some of the rites such as *Sh*a*d*angganyâsa are common to all the Nityâs. Vv. 14-20 give the names of eight Shaktis namely, Vashinî, Kâmeshvarî, Mohinî, Vimalâ, Aru*n*â, Jayinî, Sarveshvarî and Kaulinî as also their Mantras and Nyâsakrama theperformance of which renders the Sâdhaka Devyâtmaka. Theseeight Shaktis represent cold (Shîta) heat (U*shn*a) pleasure(Sukha) pain (Du*h*kha) desire (Ichchhâ) and the three Gu*n*as Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. The places in which Nyâsa is donewith these Shaktis are given in v. 21. Cf. Bhâvanopani*sh*adSûtra 20. Vv. 22-25 give the Bîja Mantras of the nine Mudrâs. Cf. Âdhâranavakam mudrâshaktaya*h* in Bhâvanopani*sh*ad 12. Vv. 30, 31 enumerate twenty Mudrâs. They are Âvâhanî, Sthâpanî, Sannirodhanî, Avagu*nth*anî, Sannidhâpanî, Heti, (i. e. the fourMudrâs Vâ*n*a, Dhanu*h*, Pâsha, Angkusha) Namaskriyâ, Sangk*sh*obha*n*î, Drâvi*n*î, Âkar*sh*a*n*î, Vashyâ, Unmâdanî, Mahângkushâ, Khecharî, Bîja, Yoni, and Shaktyutthâpanî also calledTrikha*nd*â. Heti above described is fourfold as the five Arrows(Vâ*n*a) Bow (Dhanu*h*) Noose (Pâsha) and Goad (Angkusha). The five arrows are the five Tanmâtras. The Mind as Manas is the Bow of Sugarcane. Attachment to objects is bondage orthe noose (Râgâ*h* pâshâ*h*) and Aversion to objects is the goad(Dve*sh*o'ngkusha*h*). See Bhâvanopani*sh*ad 21-24. Vv. 34-54 describe the Mudrâs which in vv. 55-59 are said to be of threekinds, Sthûla, Sûkshma, Para, according as they are made withthe hands or body, thought of in Mantras, and understood as they really are (Tattvarûpena). The last ten Mudrâs are alludedto in the Sûtra cited. Trikhandâ or Shaktyutthâpanî is so calledbecause it cuts the three which are Jnâtâ, Jnâna, Jneya from theSangsâra (Tribhi*h* jnât*ri*jnânajneyâtmabhi*h* sangsârakha*nd*anât). This is the Mudrâ by which Lalitâ is invoked (Lalitâvahâ). V. 58 defines Mudrâ (Mudang râtîti Mudrâ) as that whichcauses pleasure (to the Devatâ). The least little mistake it says might produce displeasure where pleasure was intended. The meaning of the Sûtra in the Bhâvanopani*sh*ad is that the last ten Mudrâs are associated with (Abheda) nine Âdhârasnamely the six Chakras beginning with Mûlâdhâra, theLambikâgra and two lotuses of a thousand petals one of whichis in the head and the other below the Mûlâdhâra, the tenth being the collectivity of all these.

 Vv. 60, 61 speak of the five kinds of Arghyapâtra.

 Lalitâ should be meditated upon as being red in colour. In the 28th Sûtra of Bhâvanopani*sh*ad it is said “Redness is theVimarsha of all this” (Lauhityametasya sarvasya vimarsha*h*). Bhâskararâya says that by “of all” (Sarvasya) is meant Kâm-



eshvara, Lalitâ, and the Sâdhaka's self. The Vimarsha of theseis the redness of the Devî Who is object of worship. This is sobecause of the welding (Âtmanyanurâgât) of these three in one, and this attachment (Râga) or welding and Redness (Lauhitya)are one (see also Ch. XXXV) Cf. “One's Âtmâ is the Devatâ Lalitâ Whose body is the universe (Vishvavigrahâ). Redness is Her Vimarsha (as mere Prakâsha She is white and redness indicates Ichchhâ and Rajas) and worship is the Meditation on this”. She is of blissful mien, carries in Her hands arrows, bow, nooseand goad. She is seated and united with Kâmarâja and issurrounded by Shaktis. These are of the same colour, aredecked in the same ornaments and carry the same weapons but are not (as Lalitâ is) united with Kâmarâjâ.

 Vv. 66-71 enumerate the eighteen Shaktis who shouldbe worshipped in the first or Trailokyamohana Chakra. Theseagain are divided into two groups. The first of ten beginningwith A*n*imâ and the second of eight begins with Brâhmî. The places of worship are given in Chapters I and VIII of Nityâ*sh*odashikâr*n*ava (See also Bhâvanopani*sh*ad S. 11 and Ch. XXV of this book). The first group of ten are associated withNiyati and the nine Rasa beginning with Sh*ri*nggâra, and the second group of eight represent Kâma, Krodha, Lobha, Moha, Mada, Mâtsaryya, Pû*n*ya and Pâpa. (See Bhâvanopani*sh*ad S. 11).

 Vv. 72, 73 name the Shaktis to be worshipped on the sixteenpetalled lotus. These are Kâmâkar*sh*i*n*î and others. TheseShaktis are Adhidevatâs of Earth (Prithivî) Water (Ap) Fire (Tejas) Air (Vâyu) Ether (Âkâsha) Hearing (Shrotra) Touch(Tvak) Sight (Chak*sh*u), Taste (Jihvâ) Smell (Ghrâ*n*a) Speech(Vâk) Feet (Pâda) Hands (Pâ*n*i) Anus (Pâyu) Genitals(Upastha). There is then Manovikâra which some read asapplying to all sixteen and others to Manas alone. The sixteen(See Bhâvanopani*sh*ad) are enumerated not only in the Tantrarâja but in the Nityâ*sh*odashikâr*n*ava, Yoginíh*ri*daya and otherworks.

 Vv. 75. 76 give the names of the eight Shaktis to be worshipped on the petals of the eight-petalled lotus (third Chakra).They are Ananggakusumâ and others. These are the Buddhiof Speech (Vachana), Taking (Âdâna), Motion (Gamana) Elimination (Visarga), Bliss (Ânanda) relinquishment (Hâna), concentration (Upâdâna) and Detachment (Upek*sh*â) (See Ch. XXXV) Bhâ Up. 14 Nityâ*sh*odasikâr*n*ava I 177-178VIII 140-143).



 The fourteen Shaktis to be worshipped in the Saubhâgyadâyaka Chakra of fourteen angles are given in vv. 77-79. Theyare Sarvasangk*sh*obhi*n*î and others. They are the Devîs ofthe fourteen Nâ*d*îs (See Ch. XXXV Bhâ, Up. 15).

 Vv. 80-83 give the ten Shaktis Sarvasiddhipradâ and othersto be worshipped in the Dashâra called Sarvârthasâdhana. These are the Devatâs of the ten “airs” in the body, Prâ*n*a andthe rest (Ch. XXXV Bha. Up. 16-18) Nityâ*sh*odashikâr*n*ava I.184-186, VIII 151-155. The first five belong to the Pentadcommencing with Prâ*n*a and the second to that commencing with Nâga.

 Vv. 84-86 name ten Shaktis to be worshipped in the innerDashâra called Sarvarogahara. These are Sarvajnâ and othersand the Kalâs of fire. These are Rechaka Pâchaka Sho*sh*aka, Dâhaka, Plâvaka, K*sh*âraka, Udgâraka, K*sh*obhaka, J*ri*mbhaka, and Mohaka. Some say that the vital fire is tenfold becauseit is in the seven Dhâtus and the three Do*sh*a. (See Introduction Prapanchasâra Tantra vol. III Tantrik Texts Ed. A.Avalon); but this is not apparently so according to the Tantrarâja (See Ch. XXXV also Bhâ, Up. 19). Nityâ*sh*odashikâr*n*ava 187-190 VIII 156-159 Yoginîh*ri*daya III.

 V. 87 gives the Mantra and rules of worship of the eightShaktis Vashinî and others to be worshipped in the eight angles(A*sh*târa) or Sarvarak*sh*âkara Chakra. These, though notnamed in this Chapter, are Vashinî, Kâmeshî, Modinî, Vimalâ, Aru*n*î, Jayinî, Sarveshî, and Kaulinî (vv. 14-20). Betweenthis Chakra and the next which is a triangle called Sarvasiddhimaya are worshipped the arrows, the bow, the noose and the goad representing the Tanmâtras, Manas, Râga and Dve*sh*a. The second line of v. 89 gives the place of worship of the nineNâthas at the back of the Devî (Devyâ*h* p*rishth*ata*h*) in the inner triangle. V. 90 saysthat in as much as the Devî in the centremanifests Herself in sixteen different forms (*Sh*o*d*ashâkârata*h*sthitâ), the other fifteen should be worshipped in Her body (Tasyâ*h* tanau). The three Shaktis Kâmeshvarî, Vajreshvarî, and Bhagamâlinî are to be worshipped in the three cornersbeginning with the western, that is lower, angle and going round on the right. That is wherever the Sâdhaka faces is regarded as the east. Therefore the lower point of the triangle is the west. These are not the Nityâs so called but Âvara*n*a Devatâsbearing the same name. These three corners are the Pî*th*asKâmrûpa, Pûr*n*agiri, and Jâlandhara. These Shaktis are Avyakta, Mahat and Ahangkâra that is Prak*ri*ti, the cosmic



Buddhi and Ahangkâra (See Bhâvanopani*sh*ad 25) Then theDevî should be worshipped in the middle that is in the middleof the ninth Chakra which is Au*dd*yânapî*th*a. This is theSthûlapûja. Her Pâdukâ Mantra is “Hring Shring Samastâmmûlavidyâm au*dd*yânapi*th*e shrimahâtripurasundarî-devîshripâdukâm pûjayâmi”. In each of the nine Chakras the Devî isworshipped in the centre under one of Her nine names (givenin the following Chapter vv. 14-15) united with the PâdukâMantra of seven letters.

 Her worship again is of three kinds :— Sthûla (as where Sheis thought of as red) Sûk*sh*ma (in the mantra-body or mantratanu) and Para when the Pûjâ and the fruit thereof is offeredto Her. The Sthûla worship is Samastavidyâ, the Sûk*sh*maworship in the form of the letters is Nâmarûpavidyâ and the Para worship is Arpa*n*a vidyâ.

 Vv. 98-100 speak of Meditation on the identity of Guru, Devatâ and Mantra which (says the Manoramâ) is very secret(Rahasya) and should not be disclosed and is only to be learntfrom the Guru. The highest (Turîya) form of the Devî is thethree Bindus (Bindutraya) which are also the form of the fourthvowel. This Chakra has one Bindu above and two below.The former is the face and the two below are the breasts andthe lines of the fourth vowel (I) are Her lower limbs. By meditation on these the Sâdhaka becomes one (Tadâtmaka) with Devî.

* Chapter V.* This continues the worship of Lalitâ. Afterworshipping Her in manner enjoined the Sâdhaka considershimself as the Devî (Svâtminang tatsamang smaretand one with Devî (Devyâtmâ). He is then happy (v. 5).

 There are nine Chakras which Bhâskararâya (p. 40) saysfall under three heads *Srisht*i, Sthiti and Sanghâra, creation, maintenance and withdrawal. The first three (1, 2, 3,) areSrishti of which the first is *Srisht*i-*srisht*i, the second *Srisht*i-sthiti the third *Srisht*i-sanghâra. The second group of three (4, 5, 6) of the nine are Sthiti of which the first is Sthiti-*srisht*i, the second Sthiti-sthiti and the third Sthiti-sanghâra.The lastgroup of three (7,8,9) of the nine are Sanghâra of which thefirst is Sanghâra-*Srisht*i the second Sanghâra-Sthiti and thethird Sanghara-Sanghâra. In the Tantrântara Tantra these threeprimary groups are called Moon (Soma or *Srisht*i Sun (Sûryya or Sthiti) and Fire (Anala or Sanghâra). The names of the nineChakras are (1) Trailokya-mohana (S*risht*i-S*risht*i (2) Sarvâ



shâ-paripûraka (S*risht*i-Sthiti), (3) Sarvasangk*sh*obha*n*a (S*risht*i-Sanghâra) (4) Sarvasaubhâgyadâyaka (Sthiti-S*risht*i), (5) Sarvârthasâdhaka (Sthiti-Sthiti), (6) Sarvarogahara (Sthiti-Sanghâra), (7) Sarvarakshâ-kara (Sanghâra-S*risht*i), (8) Sarvasiddhiprada (Sanghâra-Sthiti), (9) Sarvânandamaya (Sanghâra-Sanghâra). This last is the place of the Central Binduand is Shivâtmaka (vv. 9 and 10). The Yoginîs in these Chakrasare (1) Praka*t*â (2) Guptâ (3) Guptatarâ (4) Sampradâyâ (5) Kulakaulâ (6) Nigarbhâ (7) Rahasyâ(8) Parâpararahasya (9)Atirahasyâ. These are in the Middle of the Chakras and aregross forms (Sthûlavigrahâ) being the covering (Âvara*n*a) of theSûkshma or Mantra form. The Para is, unconditioned by time or space and is immanent in the last. The nine names of the Devîare Tripurâ, Tripureshî, Tripurasundarî, Tripuravâsinî, Tripurashrî, Tripuramâlinî, Tripurasiddhâ, Tripurâmbâ, and Mahâtripurasundarî (v. 14). In each of these nine forms the Devî isworshipped in the nine different Chakras with the prescribedMantra (v. 15). Vv. 17, 18 say that as soon as the Sâdhaka rises from his sleep in the early morning he should think ofhimself as Tripurâ (Tripurâtmânam) and meditate on Herlustrous Light form (Jyotîrûpa) in the head.

 Vv. 19-21 enjoin that during worship the Sâdhaka shouldwear a red cloth, smear himself with red sandal, wear redgarlands and red ornaments. He should be in a pleasant frame of mind, scented with camphor. He should sit inPadmâsana facing East and keep himself and his vital airs(Prâ*n*âh) under control.

 Vv. 23-25 enjoin the worship of the nine gems, thegarden of Kalpa trees (Kalpakodyâna) the six seasons, thesenses, which are compared to horses and the objects of thesenses which are likened to elephants. V. 26 also refers tothe nine gems. In this connection may be noted Bhâvanopani*sh*ad (6-8) which says that the body is the island of nine gems(Deho navaratnadvipa*h*) which are Pu*sh*parâga (topaz) Nîla(sapphire) Vaidûrya (catseye) Vidruma (coral) Mauktika(pearl) Marakata (emerald) Vajra (diamond) Gomeda, Padmarâga (ruby). Tvagâdisaptadhaturomasangyukta*h*. Thesegems in the body are Tvak (touch) the seven Dhâtus namelyRasa (chyle) Mângsa (flesh) Rudhira (blood) Shukra (semen)Majjâ(marrow) Asthi (bone) and Meda (fat) together withRoma (hair). Time is divided into nine parts *viz*. Gha*t*ikâ(24 minutes) Yâma (3 hours) Ahorâtra (day and night) Vâra(day of a week) Tithi (lunar day) Pak*sh*a (lunar fortnight) Mâsa (solar month) R*i*tu (season or two months) and Abda (year).



The principal Mudrâs beginning with Sangk*sh*obhi*n*î are nine.The Mât*ri*kâs are divided into nine groups. There are nineGurus. The Tattvas are nine (obtained by combinations ofJnât*ri* Jnâna, Jneya). The planets are nine as are also theDhâtus (Tvak. As*ri*k, etc.) V. 47 speaks of the worship of the arrows (Vâ*n*a) bow (Châpa) noose (Pâsha) and goad (Angkusha). The arrows are either Sthûla, Sûk*sh*ma or Para. As being thefirst they are made of flowers, as being second they are in theform of Mantra (Mantrâtmâna*h*) and as Para they are (as described in the Chapter dealing with Vâsanâ) the fiveTanmâtras. As Sthûla they are of the following flowers, Lotus(Kamala) Red Night-Lotus (Rakta kairava) water lily (Kalhâra)blue lotus (Indivara) and mango flower (Sahakâraja). TheBow, Noose and Goad are similarly Sthûla, Sûk*sh*ma and Para.

 The bow is sugarcane (Sthûla), made of Mantra, and theManas. The noose and the goad are of material, or Mantraform, and their Para form is Râga (desire noose) and Dve*sh*a(hostility: goad).

  Then follows description of the Nityapûjâ.

 Vv. 78-79 direct that when doing Purashchâra*n*a the companyof an unbeliever (Nâstika) should be avoided and vv. 79-80enjoin the avoidance of desire for, or decrying, the land, houseand wife of another, and being angry with and beating womeneven if they be wicked.

 In v. 81 it is said that in the Vâsanâ Chapter (XXXV) the signs which indicate the attainment of the state of aSiddha are given; the following indicate that a man is moving tothat state; dreams of association with women, or of riding on anelephant, of enjoyment in a palatial house or on a mountain top. the seeing of kings, procession of elephants, singing and dancingof women in dream, the seeing of festivals in dream, the seeing and taking of wine and meat in dream. Some other signs arementioned which indicate that a man is straying from the pathof Siddhi *viz*. Seeing black soldiers, beating, smearing of oil(which is not done by Brahmachârîs), sexual connection withothers' wives, state of anarchy, fear of fire, air, water, death of a friend, slighting a Guru, accumulation of wealth, disease and worshipping with other mantras than the Sâdhaka's own.

 He (v. 88) who does Japa without knowing Kûrmasthitinot only fails to get the fruit thereof but he meets with destruction. Therefore should Kûrma be first known. Kûrma is of four



kinds namely firstly Para Kûrma. This which is steady (Sthira) and extends to 50 Ko*t*i (500,000,000) of Yojanas (between 8 and 9 miles) supports P*ri*thivî. The others are Deshagata, Grâmaga and G*ri*haga. That is just as the Supreme Tortoisesupports the whole universe, the others support particular countries, villages, and dwellings.

 *Chapter VI.* Naimittika and Kâmya Pûjâ are here dealtwith ; the first in verses 1-32. Here the rites are describedwhich are to be performed from Chaitra to Fâlguna. The*Sha*tkarma of those devoted to Naimittika rites are Yantra, Homa, K*ri*yâ, Dhyâna, Yoga and Tarpa*n*a which are described in the rest of the Chapter. The six Kâmya Karmas are Raks*h*â, Shânti, Jaya, Lâbha, Nigraha and Nidhana, *i.e*., protection andpeace giving, victory and gain giving, punishing and destruction(v. 35). For the first worship should be done in the Bhûpura; for the second in the Vârima*nd*ala, for the third in the Dahanâgâra,for the fourth in the Anilama*nd*ala and for the fifth and sixth in the Vyomama*nd*ala (v. 37). Onward to v. 51 details are givenof worship in the five Bhûta Ma*nd*alas as regards the appropriateseason, month, letter, day of the week and the articles ofworship. Then follow the fruits gained by worship in differentparts of the Shrîchakra (vv. 52-57); how to control Apsarâ and Yak*sh*i*nî* (vv. 58-70); worship productive of knowledge ofpast, present and future (vv. 73-74) worship to gain four kindsof proficiency (Pâ*nd*itya) (vv. 75-77) which according to theManoramâ) are Vâditva, Kavitva, Vâgmitva and Vyâkhyât*ri*tvaor the power to speak clearly, literary ability, eloquence, andpower of explanation. Then follows worship for the avoidanceof all ailments (vv. 78-80); the names of the seven artîcles formaking Shrîchakra, to wit, saffron, vermilion, red ochre(Gairika) Lac, red lead (Darada) and sandal both red and white(v. 78). Each of verses 93-98 give a different form of worship(Bhajana) and v. 99 states the final aim of worship namely the realisation of the unity of the Devî, the self, Chakra, theDevatâs therein and the surrounding Shaktis.

 *Chapter VII*. This is devoted to the second Nityâ, Kâmeshvarî who (III. v 8) is fulfiller of Desire (Kâmadâ). After speaking of Nyâsa-krama (in vv. 3-6) verses 8-10 give thefollowing Dhyâna of this Devî. She is (lustrous red) like ten million rising suns, wears a bright crown of rubies and isadorned with throat ornament (Graiveya), necklaces, waistchainsand rings on Her hands and feet. Her ornaments are set withgems. Her raiment is red. She is sixarmed and three-eyedand carries the crescent (Kalâ) of the Moon on Her head. Her



face is lit up with a soft smile and Her eyes are merciful. Sheis in Her Chakra or Yantra which is on a lotus. She carries inHer hands a bow of sugarcane, arrows of flowers, noose andgoad and a cup made of gems filled with nectar. She makesthe gesture granting boons. The five arrows are to be worshipped in each of the petals of the five petalled lotus which is Kâmeshvarî's Yantra. Their names are Madana, Unmâdana, Dipana, Mohana and Sho*sh*a*n*a the five effects of desire, longingmaddening, kindling, enchanting, wasting (v.13).The eightShaktis in the eight petalled lotus are Ananggakusumâ ; Ananggamekhalâ, Ananggamadanâ, Ananggamadanâturâ, Madavegini, Bhuvanapâlâ, Shashirekhâ, Gaga*n*arekhâ (vv. 14-15).In the lotus of sixteen petals the following Shaktis are to beworshipped:— Shraddhâ, Prîti, Rati, Dh*ri*ti, Kânti, Manoramâ, Manoharâ, Manorathâ, Madanonmâdinî, Mohinî, Dîpanî, Sho*sh*a*n*î, Vashangkarî, Sinjinî, Subhagâ, Priyadarshanâ.

In the corners of theouter Hexagon is worshiped *D*âkinî and others (v. 21). Outsidethis and round the square Ba*t*uka Ga*n*apa, Durgâ andK*sh*etresha should be worshipped. The Supreme Devî firstcreated the five Kâmas or Desire-Devatâs which are Jnânâtmakaand which the Commentary explains to be Her five Jnânend*ri*yas. The former are of bewildering power and can moveand agitate the three worlds (Loka) (vv. 27-28). These Kâmasare Kâmarâja (King of Desire) Manmatha (Agitator) Kandarpa(Inflamer) Makaraketana (whose banner bears a Makara) andManobhava (Mind-born, for desire is born there). These agitatethe world (vv. 29-30). They are of five colours, yellow, white, red, purple (Dhûmra the colour of smoke) and blue. Theyhave two eyes and arms and are of smiling countenance andcarry sugarcane bow and flowery arrows. They are Bhautika(Bhûtâtmaka) and exist in the form of all things (Vishvavigraha) (vv. 31-33). The concluding verses give the Mantras, Nyâsa, and Yantras and so forth in the worship of this Devî.

The Mantra which is given in the thirdChapter is one of the longest known, being of 135 Kû*t*as.

 Then follow nineteen verses (72-90) of disordered letters(Vyâkulitâk*sh*ara). This is a cryptic style of writing adoptedto keep the contents concealed and which can only be read bythose who have the key. The notes to the verses are also in thesame character. As here printed the words have been wronglyarranged as the Texts consulted are at fault. Whilst reproducing the texts I add here a correct reading :

 The key is as follows 8, 4, 6, 2, 7, 3, 5, I, that is the firstletter is given as the eighth and so on. These verses describeonly the different kinds of wine to be used in the worship, howto make and how to drink them. There is no mention here orin the rest of the volume of Maithuna. It states that the Siddha should never drink wine unless it has been first offeredas Arghya to the Devî on whom as the object of worship theMind must be kept. Wine should be drunk until the Mind iswholly absorbed in the Devî. To drink more than that is tosin. He, who drinks without offering and for the satisfaction of his desire, is a sinner, a worshipper of ignorance and should bepunished by the King. The following verses of which the aboveis a translation should be noted by those who criticise this Shâstra,

**Na kadâchit pivet siddho devyarghyamaniveditam.  
Pânancha tâvat kurvîta yâvatâ syân manolaya*h*.  
Tata*h* karoti chet sadya*h* pâtakî bhavati dhruvam.  
Devatâgurusevânyat pîvannâsavamâshayâ.  
Pâtakî râjada*nd*yashchâvîdyopasaka eva cha.**

 V. 91 and following describe the Yantra called Yonyar*n*ava,the worship thereof and the fruits gained thereby.

(Vv. 61-71) describe the Yantra of the Devî and (vv. 72-74) another kind ofYantra. The rest of the Chapter is devoted to Prayoga of theMantra and Yantra.

She issurrounded on all sides by Shaktis like unto Her. So shouldShe the Fire-dweller (Vahnivâsinî) Who assumes the form of theUniverse (Vishva-vigrahâ) be meditated upon and worshipped. According to Pandit Yajna Puru*sh*a the right reading is Vishvaghasmarâ (She Who devours the universe) and not Vishvavigrahâ.

 Her Shaktis are (vv. 14-22) Jvâlinî Visphulingginî Manggalâ, Sumanoharâ, Kanakâ, Angkitâ, Vishvâ and Vividhâ who areworshipped in the eight corners.

Her crown is bright with gemsbeyond all price and rubies, earrings, neck-chains, armlets, waist chains and anklets highten Her own brightness. On Herbeautious breasts are clusters of red gems. In Her are all thewords of the Vedas. In Her right hands She carries a rosary ofcoral beads, a lotus, a Ka*nd*kâ (Kama*nd*alu) made of gems adrinking cup (Cha*sh*aka) made of gems, full of wealth, a citronor lemon (Mâtulungga) and with one hand She makes the gesture of explanation (Vyâkhyânamudrâ). In the left hands are abook, red lotus, a golden pen, a garland of gems, a conch shell. She makes the gesture of granting boons (Varamudrâ) She issurrounded by Devas, Gandharvas, Kinnaras who sing Herpraises as also by Yak*sh*as, Râk*s*hasas and the like. So shouldShe be meditated upon for the attainment of learning wealth and beauty. When worshipped for the attainment of learningShe is thought of as white, and when wealth is sought of Her, She is meditated upon as being of a golden colour.

 Her eleven Parivâra Shaktis are (vv. 17-20 as follows :—

 Bhâ*sh*â, Sarasvatî, Vâ*n*î, Sangsk*ri*tâ, Prâk*ri*tâ, Parâ, Kha*d*garûpâ, Vittarûpâ, Ramyâ, Ânandâ, Kautukâ who should beworshipped in the Navayonis. In the eight petals of the outerlotus should be worshipped the eight Mât*ri*kâs) Brâhmî andothers. In the square the Lokapâlas and their Shaktis (or in their Shakti form) should be worshipped.



 The four following verses give directions for drawing HerNityapûjâChakra and as to the scents to be used in theworship of this Devî (17-24).

 The Tantra then deals with the three Kû*t*as or parts of ordivisions of the Mantra “Aing, Klîng, Hsau*h*.” The Vidyâ ofKulasundarî is Trayîmayî or Vedamayî and is when its vowelsare united with the consonants, the cause of the Prapanchawhich is both Shabdamaya and Arthamaya (Vâchya-Vâchakarûpa) Sâmaveda is Akârâdi and so is *Ri*gveda. Yajurvedais Ikârâdi. By the union of these Aikâra is produced (a+i=e and a+e=ai). Aikâra or Shuchi is therefore Trayîmaya(vv. 33-38). This is the meaning of Aing the first Kû*t*a. The meaning of the second Kû*t*a “Kling” is given in vv. 39 & 40. This Mantra denotes Her as cause of the Vâchya-vâchakarûpaPrapancha. The consonants between Ka and Ha signify thefive Bhûtas and as such they are Jneya, just as vowels are Jnâna(Veda). Hsau*h* the last Kûta is Jnât*ri*rûpa (v. 41). The firstKû*t*a is Vâk-svarûpa; the second is Vahni that is the union of Shiva and Shakti for in it is the fourth vowel (î) and Bindu andVisarjanîya, the origin of all the Mâtrikâs. By the last BîjaShe is Vishvâtmarûpâ whether united with Bindu (=Kha) orVisarga (Mâyâ). This is Tripurâkanda which is the united state of Jnât*ri*, Jnâna, Jneya, Vâta, Pitta, Shle*sh*mâ, Agni, Sûryya, Soma. Therefore She pervades the whole Universe.

 Vv. 45-55 speak of the effects of the Mantra accordingas it is united with other Bîjas. V. 68 speaks of the making ofVishnu Ghrita which gives powers of speech.

 *Chapter XVI*. This Chapter speaks of the Eleventh Nityâcalled Nityâ Nityâ. All moving bodies are controlled byHer and by Her all Jîvas dwell in their respective bodies. According to Her Dhyâna (vv. 6-10) She is beneficient and pervades all beings (Sarvâtmikâ) for She is the Chaitanya in all. According to the Manoramâ She is the presiding Devatâ over*D*âkinî and others who are the Shaktis of the bodily Dhâtus. Coloured like the rising sun She bears on Her head a luminouscrown. Her face is lit by a soft smile. She is dressed in red raiment and adornod with rubies. She has three eyes and twelve hands. With her right hands She carries the noose, the whitelotus, sugar-cane bow, shield and trident and makes the gestureof granting favours (Varamudrâ); and in the left hands Shecarries the goad, book, flowery arrows, sword, skull and makesthe gesture of dispelling fear (Abhayamudrâ). Her Shaktis arecountless and form a complete circle. Chapter XXV speaks of



them and includes amongst the principal *D*âkinî and others(vv. 11-15). Then the Tantra describes three different kinds ofPûjâ in three different Chakras (vv. 16-21) the Yantra(vv. 27-35) six Yantras shaped like Vajra (vv. 37-45) the Mandapa and Vedî and so forth under and on which the sameare kept and the fruît to be gained (vv. 46-58); and the sixÂdhâras or Chakras (vv. 59-71). It is to be noted that theShaktis *D*âkinî and others are not placed in the same order asin the *Sh*a*t*chakranirûpa*n*a and the Dhyâna differs. They are described as being like unto Nityâ Nityâ. Then follows anaccount of the external Chakra and Pûjâ thereof (vv. 72-75),the same subject being continued in the following verses(vv. 76-87) and in verses 88-94. In v. 91 it is said that sevenyouthful women should be placed in the seven Chakras and worshipped with presents of food, clothes, scents and jewels. By worship of the fifty couples who preside over the divisionsof Time the desired end is gained vv. 95-100). In praise ofthis Nityâ it is said (III. 55) the Sâdhaka becomes Khechara (i.e. Shiva) and blissful. By his mere wish he can favour or punish.

 *Chapter XVII.* This Chapter deals with the twelfth Nityâcalled Nâlapatâkâ. After describing the Nyâsa of Her Mantra(vv. 5-7) Her Dhyâna is given (vv. 8-12) as follows. She is sapphire-blue in colour with five faces and three eyes in each, and ten hands. Her face is sweet and smiling. She is clad in red raiment and Her hand is adorned with lustrous gems. She is decked mostly with pearls. Clusters of gems are on variousparts of Her body. In her left hands She carries a noose, banner, shield, a bow made of horn and makes the gesture ofgranting gifts. In Her right hands She carries the goad, the Shakti weapon, sword, arrows, and makes the gesture of dispelling fear. She is seated on a lotus and surrounded by anumber of Shaktîs resembling Herself. Vv. 13-17 describe theMan*d*ala of Her daily worship. In the three corners of theYantra are worshipped Ichchhâ. Jnânâ, Kriyâ and round about the triangle the five Âv*r*ittis and in the six corners of the*Sh*atko*n*a, *D*âkinî and others should be worshipped, and in thecorners of the A*sh*tako*n*â the Shaktis Brâhmî and the rest. The verses which follow up to v. 49 give details of the ritualand the fruit gained thereby. They speak of Vetâla, Pishâcha, Yaks*h*i*n*î and other similar Siddhis. The Yaks*h*i*n*îs are described as young and beautiful women Spirits in fine raiment who give to the Sâdhaka all worldly good he may desire. Thenfollow the names of thirty-six Yak*sh*i*n*îs (vv. 50-53) and ofsixty-four Che**t**akas (vv. 60-67). After some verses dealing with Mantras of Che*t*akas and with Yantras the Tantra speaks



(vv. 96-100) of the fruit which is gained by one who is Siddha in the worship of the sixteen Nityâs. He is ever honoured andworshipped by the Pit*r*is, Devar*sh*is, Râk*sh*asas, Pishâchas, Uragas, Siddhas, Kinnaras, Apsarâs, Vâyus, Vasus, Seven*Rishi*s, Yak*sh*as, Dânavas, Eleven Rudras, Sâdhyas, nineGrahas, twelve Suns, the Lokapâlas, ten Prajâpati Devatâs, Kings, Women, Men and Wild Animals. He becomes theabode of all desired Siddhis and happiness. He is cheerfulof mind, charitable, merciful and pleasing of mien, forgivingand contented, ever happy and free from all anxiety (Nirapek*sh*aphalânvita) wealthy, enjoying his possessions and averseto injuring others. Such an one is “the abode of Our Love”that is the love of Shiva and Shakti. Ch. III. vv. 59, 60, speakof various Siddhis obtained by worship of this Vidyâ such asKha*d*ga Siddhi, Pâdukâ Siddhi, Anjana Siddhi, Nidhi Siddhi, Bila Siddhi and control over Vetâlas, Yak*sh*i*n*îs, ChetakasPishâchas and so forth. Similarly in the same Chapter (vv. 62, 63, 71, 72) it is said that Siddhi in the Nityâ Vijayâ Vidyâ givesvictory in battle and success in trade and in the SarvamangalâNityâ makes the Sâdhaka Khechara Siddha, in the JvâlâmâlinîVidyâ gives the Siddhis Vedha, Âkar*sh*a*n*a, Santâpa, Vashyaand Âvesha and by Siddhi in the Chitrâ Vidyâ, wealth and selfknowledge (Âtmalâbha) is attained.

 *Chapter XVIII.* The last Chapter in this volume deals withthe thirteen Nityâ called Vijayâ Nityâ whose Dhyâna (vv. 5-10)is given as follows :— Her body is lustrous red like that of therising sun. She has five smiling faces in each of which arethree eyes and She has ten hands Her raiment is yellow. Shebears a brilliant crown and on Her forehead a crescent moonShe is decked with all kinds of ornaments. In Her left handsShe carries conch, noose, shield, bow, and white lily (Kahlâra)and in Her right hands discus (Chakra), goad (Angkusha), arrows (Sâyaka) and a citron (Mâtulunga) fruit. According tothe Prayoga when She is invoked for the purpose of victory in war and the like She is of terrific aspect but in daily worshipHer aspect is benignant. In Samaraprayoga She is meditatedupon as seated on a lion and surrounded by Shaktis who aremounted on Tigers. In other kinds of Prayoga She is to bemeditated upon as seated at her ease (Sukhâsana) surroundedby Shaktis similarly seated. Her Shaktis all resemble this Nityâ and carry the same weapons. Vv. 11-25 describe theYantra of Her daily worship and name the Shaktis who arein the different angles of Her Chakra. The self-controlled(Vashî) man who daily worships the Devî in the Chakra inmanner enjoined becomes happy in every way. Then are



described (vv. 26-27) the rules of Purashchara*n*a and thefollowing verses give details of the worship: then in vv. 55-58is described the ritual with a Mantra of eighty letters. Thefifteen verses which follow describe the drawing of a Yantra ofnine chambers and the mode of worship therein. Verses 74 to the end of the Chapter give an account of Vajra Yantra withMantra of eightyone letters and of its worship.

 The author of the Manoramâ whilst commenting on the passage in the Tantrarâja “Concerning the sixteen Nityâs thereare nine complete Tantras,” counts the Nityâ*sh*odashikâr*n*avaTantra (published as Volume 56 of the Ânandâshrama Series, Poona,) the Sundarîh*ri*daya (the name given by some to theSecond Part of the Nityâ*sh*odashikâr*n*ava) and VâmakeshvaraTantras, separately. Bhâskararâya contests this view citing a passage from the Yoginîh*ri*daya itself “In this VâmakeshvaraTantra are many matters the meaning of which is unknown(Vâmakeshvaratantrê'sminnajnâtârthâst- vanekasha*h*) and theR*i*ju-vimarshini which says “The Shâstra named Shrî Vâmakeshvara Tantra is revealed. In it is the Nityâ*sh*o*d*ashikâr*n*avaand in this latter are two parts of 400 verses each.”

 He also discusses the question whether the VâmakeshvaraTantra with its parts or the Tantrarâja is the 65th independent(Svatantra) Tantra referred to in the 31st verse of the Ânandalahari (See “Wave of Bliss” by Arthur Avalon). “PashupatiWho knows all things in the universe, promulgated by means of the 64 Tantras the special Siddhis mentioned therein. There after at Thy entreaty He brought down to this world ThySvatantra (Tantra indedendent of others) which contains themeans of accomplishment of all the Puru*sh*ârthas.” Those, whosupport the claim of the Tantrarâja to be the Svatantra here referred to, say that it does show in fact independence. They citethe passage (1-3) in the Tantrarâja :— “the interdependence(Anyonyasâpek*sh*ya) of the Tantras produces confusion. Therefore Oh Lord speak to me that Tantra relating to the sixteenNityâs which is independent (Nirapek*sh*a = Svatantra) of allother Tantras. According to the Commentator Gaurîkânta, by Svatantra in the verse cited is meant the Jnânâr*n*ava Tantra(Vol. 69 Ânandâshrama series). Bhâskararâya supports theclaim of the Vâmakeshvara Tantra. He says that the SundarîTantras such as Kulâr*n*ava, Jnânâr*n*ava Svachchhanda, Parânanda, Bhairavî, Dak*sh*inâmûrti and other Tantras are full ofBahiryâga rites and contain but litt'e of Antaryâga, whilst thereverse is the case as regards the Vâmakeshvara. He claims thatit is the most excellent of Tantras since its characteristic is inner



worship (Ântaropâsti). It is he says Upâsakamûrdhni. TheDevî in the Nityâ*sh*o*d*ashikâr*n*ava (1. 13-22) enumerates 64Tantras by name, and therefore, he says, it must be the 65th. It is true he says that the Tantrarâja takes no notice of other Tantras as regards external rites (Bahiryâga) for the attainment of Mok*sh*a yet he says that it is the Nityâ*sh*o*d*ashikâr*n*ava (part of Vâmakeshvara) which has independence as regards Antaryâga

 Bhâskararâya also relies on the statement in the Tantrarâjathat Nityâh*ri*daya is another name for Yoginîh*ri*daya and thislatter is the second part of the Nityâ*sh*o*d*ashikâr*n*ava which isa portion of the Vâmakeshvara Tantra. As regards this contention however it is to be noted that when the Tantrarâjasays that Nityâh*ri*daya is another name for Yoginîh*ri*daya, it is not referring to any Tantra at all but giving an equivalentname for Yoginîh*ri*daya. Bhâskararâya admits that there isnot much said as to Bâhyayâga in the Nityâ*sh*o*d*ashikâr*n*ava. He meets this however by quoting the precept “He has doneall things who has done according to the true intention of the Shâstra that which he is enjoined to do by his own G*ri*hya, beit much or little.” As a matter of fact the Tantrarâja containsboth Bâhyayâga and Antaryâga rites whereas the Nityâ*sh*o*d*ashikâr*n*ava is for the most part a selection of Antaryâga ritual. Moreover it is to be noted that Bhâskararâya himself, whencommenting on the Bhâvanopani*sh*ad of the Kâdimata, cites more largely from the Tantrarâja and he commences the commentary by saying that the Bhâvanopani*sh*ad deals with Antaryâga. To the statement of the Tantrarâja that all otherTantras are interdependent' he replies that the texts whichspeaks of interdependence (Sâpe*ks*hyavachana)
merely say that those who are initiated according to some other Tantra will, bydoing to the best of their ability the rites prescribed in suchTantras, attain great fruit, whereas those who are initiatedaccording to the Dîk*sh*â prescribed in Tantrarâja will by suchDîk*sh*â alone, that is without reference to rites prescribed inother Tantras, gain abundant fruit. Moreover if indispensablerites are lacking in this or any other Tantra they ought to besought in Kalpasûtras—it being a settled fact that the Kalpasûtras were composed with the sole object of supplying what waswanting in any particular case. (Tattachchhâkhâpek*sh*itârthasamarpa*n*ârthatvena): Therefore he says the objection againstthe independence (Svâtantrya) of these two parts constitutingthe Nityâ*sh*odashikâ on the ground that there is nothing said there in about Dîk*sh*â, Purashcharana, and the like is not maintainable. His argument however touching the Kalpasûtra



would, if sound, be applicable to establish the independence of any Tantra. He proceeds to say that as a fact Dîk*sh*â andthe like are alluded to in the Nityâ*sh*o*d*ashikâ. However thisquestion of pre-eminence may be decided, there is no doubt as tothe authority and importance of the Tantrarâja here published.This is shown intrinsically by its contents as also by the claim made on its behalf that it is the 65th Tantra and Bhâskararâya'sarguments on such contention.

 It is hoped to publish the second and last volume of theTantrarâja text, now in preparation, during the course of the years 1919, 1920.
