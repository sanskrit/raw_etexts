**PREFATORY NOTE.**

**(FIRST EDITION)**

  The present edition of the Yoginihṛdaya and its Commentary, viz. Yoginīhṛdaya Dîpikā, by Amṛtānanda Natha, son of Puṇyananda Nātha, is based upon the following data :

**I.** *For the Commentary—*

 (a) Manuscript, marked here as , in possession of Pandit Sitārāma Sastri of the Sankara maṭha (Śringeri branch), Benares.

 Leaves, 1–89. Complete. Script, Nāgarī. Size, 9.9" x 44" inches. Lines 11 in a page and letters 50in a line. Read and Corrected. No date, but apparently 200 years old.

 (b) Manuscript, marked as , belonging to the Government Sanskrit Library, Sarasvati Bhavana, Benares.

 Leaves, 1-53 (= 54 ), 55– Complete. Script, Nāgarī. Size, 10.8" x 4.5" inches. Lines 13 in a page and letters 54 in a line. Read and Corrected. No date, but about 300 years old.

** II.*For the Text —*

 (*a-b*) Manuscripts ''क' and 'ख', as described above.  
 (c) The text (noted as 'ग') as published, with Bhaskara Rāyā's Commentary, viz, Setubandha, inthe Nityāṣoḍaśikārṇava (pp. 177–350) in the Ānandāśrama Sanskrit Series, No. 56, in the year 1908.

<MISSING_FIG href="../books_images/U-IMG-1720113789Screenshot2024-07-04105301.png"/>

 It is well known that the Yoginihṛdaya is the name of the last three chapters (Viśrāmas VI-VIII) of the Nityāṣoḍaśikārṇava, which forms a part of the Vāmakeśvara Tantra, one of the original Tantras recognised in the Tripura School of Agamic Thought. It is regarded as equally authoritative by the Trika philosophers of Kashmir. This is not the place to enter into a discussion as to the exact nature of the relation between the attitude of the Saktas and that of the Trika Śaivas towards this Agama, but it is clear that some of the fundamental notions of the two schools regarding *“pā: and,* though closely allied, are different and this would explain the fact that the same text has been interpreted in a variety of ways.

  It will be found for instance on comparison of the Setubandha with Amṛtānanda's commentary, now offered to the public, that Bhāskara has referred to or quoted from it in several places, and has done so, it seems to us, generally in a spirit of undue disparagement. But in spite of Bhāskara's attacks it will be found that the Dīpikā has more correctly represented the traditional view-point and has been as a whole more illuminating.

  Puṇyānanda Nātha's Kāmakalāvilāsa having already appeared (in the Kashmir Sanskrit Series, No.13), the publication of the present work by his pupil calls for no apology or justification. The Dīpikā,together with the Kāmakalāvilāsa, is calculated to give us an insight into the ideas of the Kashmiri thinkers on the very intricate problems of upāsanā connected with the secrets of Kāmakala on one hand and with those of Creation and Dissolution of the Universe on the other.

  We shall have occasion to treat at full length of the date and other historical matters in connection with Amṛtānanda Natha and to present a descriptive and critical analysis of the contents of the Dipikā in our Introduction to it to be published in the second part of the work.

  In conclusion, I must express my sincere gratefulness to P. Gopāla Ś**ā**stri Nene Vyākaraṇācharya, Sādholāl Scholar, Government Sanskrit Library, Benares, for his constant help, ungrudgingly offered, in reading the proofs and in collating the readings.

**Preface to the Second Edition**

  The Publication Department of the Sanskrit University of Vārāṇasī has undertaken to bring out a new edition of Yoginihṛdaya with two Commentaries, viz. the Dīpikā by Amṛtānanda Nātha and a later Commentary by Bhaskara Raya, the distinguished Śākta savant of the 18th Century. The second work forms part of a Commentary entitled Setubandha on the entire text of the Nityāṣoḍaśikārṇava (of which the Yoginihṛdaya forms a part) published from Poona long ago. The publication in a joint form of the two Commentaries is expected to facilitate for a critical student the discovery of the true meaning of the original text in view specially of the fact that the two Commentaries represent two different versions of two distinct lines of thought, the older one standing for the view point of the Hadi School associated with Lopamudra and the newer one an exposition of the rival Kādi School of K**ā**madeva.

  The Yoginihṛdaya also known as Nityāhṛdaya or Sundarihṛdaya is supposed to be the best authoritative work on the Divine Mother's inner worship. In the history of relevant Śākta literature we come across the names of twelve well-known traditional lines of Devotion connected with this worship—viz. those founded by **Manu, Chandra, Kubera, Lopāmudrā, Manmatha or Kāmadeva, Śiva and**Durvāsā.[^1] Most of these sects have disappeared in the process of time except the two of Kamadeva and Lopamudrā. Of these two the line of Kamadeva is flourishing[^2] .

[^1]: "The Vidya worshipped by Manu consisted of 18 letters and In worshipped by Chandra and Kubera was of 22 letters that some places the names of Nandi and Viṣṇu are found instead of Indra and Agni in the list. Further differences of names and details are also noticed."

[^2]: "It is said in the Tripurarahasya, Mahatmyakhanda, that Kama propitiated the Goddess and added to the glory of the Vidya worshipped by him."

  It is well–known that the Kāmarāja-vidyā (of 15 letters) is of two kinds, viz. Sakta or Sambhava. Of these two the former belongs to the Urdhvāmnāya and is free from the defect of impotency through, while the latter which belongs to Purvāmnāya is defective. The Lopamudrā Vidyā, also of 15 letters, is similarly of two kinds (viz. Sākta as well as Śambhava ).

  The Kādi-Vidya, consisting of 15 letters, is favoured in the Tantrarāja and in the Tripurā Upanisad. The Hādi Vidyā too consists of the same number of letters; it is expounded in some Sākta Upanisads.[^3]

[^3]: "The Bahvrcha Upanisad speaks of Kadi, Hadi and Sadi Vidyas in connection with the Sambhavi Vidya representing the Supreme Divine Power."

  It is said that Durvāsā worshipped the 13 lettered form of the Hādi Vidya. His Lalita Stavaratna has been published. I noticed long ago a manuscript of Para Sambhu Stotra attributedto Durvāsā, called therein Krodha Bhaṭṭāraka.

 Durvāsā also wrote a Mahimnaḥstotra in honour of the Goddess Tripura, on which Nityananda Nātha, the disciple of Vidyānanda alias Srinivāsa Bhaṭṭa Gosvāmi commented.

 According to some authorities Yoginihṛdaya is one of the four principal works of Kādimata, the other three being Tantrarāja, Mātṛikārṇava and Tripurārṇava. Subhagānanda Natha in his commentary Manorama on the Tantrarāja, and Bhaskara Raya in his commentary on the Bhāvanā Upanisad also admit this. But the latter in the Varivasya-rahasya recognises the Hādi interpretion of the Yoginihṛdaya as equally authoritative.

 A critical study of the contents of the text conducted along traditional lines as well as on the basis of one's personal Yogic experience expressed in terms of the ideological technique accepted in the Schools is the greatest desideratum of the hour and will I hope be forthcoming in the near future. Such a study should include in its scope the mysteries of Chakra, Mantra and Pūjā—questions on which the present text seeks to throw valuable light.

 It is well known that the three kinds of worship of the Supreme Goddess, viz. the external **(बहिर्याग)**, Japa, and the internal **(अन्तर्याग)**, are not mutually exclusive, though each represents a special type with its own predominant features. While the Tripura–tāpini and other Upanisads dwell on the former two, the internal worship consisting in the method of meditation **(भावना)** forms the subject matter of the Bhāvanā Upanisad. It suggests the manner in whichmeditation is to be practised on the Sri Chakra which is located within the Kāla–Chakra.

 These meditations are according to some authorities prescribed in two different ways in the Tantras—the way of the Kadi–School and that of the Hādi School. The doctrine of Antaryāga implies that the Chakras are to be viewed within the body, though the different ways favour different methods. The Bhāvanā Upanisad explains the Kādi stand–point. In this connection a reference to the Nityā–hṛdaya (Yoginīhṛdaya), the Tantrarāja and the Bindu Sūtra is likely to prove illuminating.

  What the Bhāvanā Upanishad says implies that the Human Body is to be conceived as the Śrī Chakra, being the expression of one's own Self **(स्वात्मा).** This means that while on one hand the Body is to be regarded as non–different from the Atma, the entire cosmic system (associated with the Body, should also be viewed in the same light. This outer system in its manifestation rests on Time **(काल)**, Space **(देश)** and a combination of the **(काल)**, two. The exponents of the School hold that the well–known fifteen Kalās of the Moon (viz. Darśā, Dṛṣṭā, etc.), representing the 15 lunar tithis (Pratipat to Pūrṇimā) are to be regarded as identical with the fifteen Nityās (Kāmeśvari to Chitra). The sixteenth Kala called Sādākhyā should be viewed as one with Lalita or the Supreme Deity Herself. In other words, one has to feel that what appears in Kāla–chakra is nothing but an expression of what exists eternally as Nityās in the Supreme Sri Chakra Itself.

  The Tithichakra or the Wheel of Time is constantly revolving and the Sri Chakra is within it, and not without.

  It should also be remembered that from the viewpoint of an esoteric yogin the tithis are in the last analysis to be identified with the 21600 Śvāsas supposed to be the average number of breaths per day of a normal human being.

  In a similar manner these thinkers deal with Space **(देश)**. According to ancient Pauranic Cosmology the entire structure of the World is looked upon as a series of 14 graded divisions of land and water from Jambudvipa on one hand to Sweet–watered (मधुरोद) Ocean on the other, in addition to Meru beyond Jambudvipa and Para Vyoma beyond the Sweet Ocean. The Nitya Maṇḍala revolves in a way that each Nitya comes in touch with a particular space-division in its annual course, so that, while in the first year the Nityās start from the Meru, in the sixteenth they find themselves starting from the Para Vyoma. This is known as Desa-chakra **(देशचक्र).**

The Yoginihṛdaya has its own method of inner worship which is not only unique but truly representative of a very old traditional line. The Chid-Gagana-Chandrikā, Mahārthamañjarī and some works of the Krama School of thought possess a valuable literature on this subject which calls for a close and careful study in this connection.

**INTRODUCTION**.

*The Work :*

The following pages embody a commentary, together with the original text, of Yoginihṛdaya, called Dīpikā, by Amṛtānanda Nātha. The text, which forms a part of the Vāmakeśvara Tantra ( being its last three chapters) was published in the Anandaśrama Sanskrit Series, together with its Commentary Setubandha, by Bhaskara Rāya, but the publication of the Dipika which represents an ancient line of thought will add considerably to our knowledge of the secret doctrines of the School.

*The Author :*

 The Dipika is the work, as has already been stated, of Amṛtānanda Nātha, who calls himself the disciple of Puṇyānanda Nātha of Kashmir reputation. Both the preceptor and the disciple are said to have been great Yogins and were known as *paramahamsas.* Puṇyānanda's Kāmakalāvilāsa, to which the author of the Dipika often refers as the work of his Guru[^1851], has already been published[^4].

[^4]: "In the kashhmir Sanskrit Series, and in the Tantrik Texts."

[^1851]: "Cf. Dipiká, pp. 11."

 Besides the Yoginihṛdaya-Dīpikā, Amṛtānanda also wrote Ṣattrin sattattvasandoha[^5]and Saubhagya Subhagoday[^6]")a. In the Catalogus Catalogorum (Vol. I, p. 29), Aufrecht speaks of two more works as coming from his pen, viz. Ajñānabodhinī țikā and Tattvadipana (in Vedanta ). But it is very doubtful if the author of these latter Vedānta works was identical with the great Kashmiri teacher of the same name. Weber's assertion (p. 361), referred to by Aufrecht, that Amṛtānanda corrected Kriṣṇānanda's Tantrasāra, is equally inapplicable to our author for the simple reason that Kṛṣṇānanda, who was a contemporary of Raghunatha Širomaņi, Śrī Chaitanya Deva and Raghunandana of Nadia ( 1460–1560 A. D. ', was was a later writer than the author of the Dipikā.

[^5]: "Published in the Kashmir Sanskrit Series."

[^6]: "Referred to in the Dipikā, pp. 38, 79, 98 and 135. The work was in the form of Kārikās. *This appeared in Part 2 of the original edition. (K.C

*Dipikā and Setubandha :*

 A reader of the Setubandha cannot but be struck with the points of difference between Bhāskara's interpretation and that of Amṛtânanda. Bhāskara refers to the views of the Dīpikā, sometimes with approval, but often in a spirit of disparagement. A comparative study of the two commentaries, carried on with a dispassionate mind, is sure to reveal the fact that inspite of Bhāskara's animadversions, Amṛtānanda, as representing the traditional line of explanation, is generally a safer and more reliable guide to the intricacies of this Mystic Sādhanā. Want of space compels me to refrain from dwelling on this point at greater length here and reserve a systematic study of the question for a separate paper.

*Contents of the Yoginihṛdaya :*

 It is not possible to sum up within the limits of this Introduction the doctrines taught in the work,but considering the importance of the subject a few words may here be spoken.

 The book is divided into three sections, called patalas, dealing respectively with the threefold sanketa of the Supreme Goddess—( i ) Chakra, ( ii ) Mantra and (iii ) Pūjā.

 (i) The Chakra, usually known as Śri Chakra or Tripurā Chakra, represents the Supreme Divine Power as manifested in the form of the Universe, gross, subtle, as well as causal. The Chakra consists of nine triangles, five with vertices downwards and four with vertices upwards. The former represents the creative aspect of Power and is called 'Sakti', whereas the latter, called 'Fire', stands for its destructive phase. The origin of the Chakra is explained as due to the Will for Self–revelation on the part of the Supreme power. Śiva and Sakti are known as Fire and Moon, andtheir equilibrium, where the difference between thetwo is obliterated, is called Sun, otherwise known as Kūma or Supreme Bindu. It is said that as in contact with fire ghee melts and flows out, similarly the contact of Fire or Siva **( प्रकाश )** causes the Moon or Sakti **( विमर्श )** to melt and flow out. This outflow, from between the two Bindus, is called Hardhakalā. The Kāma as associated with the Hardhakalā gives rise to the first Chakra, called Baindava, which is the source of all kinds of subsequent waves or vibrations, i. e. of all the 36 Tattvas, in fact of the entire Universe. The Baindava Chakra, a triangle in form, comprises the three Mātṛkās viz. Pasyanti, Madhyamā and Vaikhari. It is called Baindava in as much as itoriginates from Bindu—the original or fourth Bindu, which is in reality nothing but the aggregate of the three Mātṛkās referred to above and known other–wise as Sadāsiva or Paramātmā.

 The Baindava or inmost Chakra produces the so–called Navayoni Chakra, consisting of 9 triangles referred to above. The elements of this Chakra or the nine Yonis are (i–ii) Dharma and Adharma, (iii–vi) Ātmă, Antarātmā, Paramātmā and Jñānātmā, (vii–viii) Jiva and Objects (**ग्राह्य**), and (ix) Right Knowledge (**प्रमा**). This nine–fold Chakra is, within and without, purely Chit (i. e. **चैतन्यकला**) and Ananda (i. e. manifestation or rather modification of **पूर्णहन्ता**), is free from the limitations of Time, Space and Form. The Baindava Chakra is inner, in relation to which the Nava Yoni Chakra is outer. If should be remembered that the Navayoni is composed of the Vaikharī Mātṛkā only.

 The Navayoni Chakra is transformed into the nine chakras, viz. (i) Trailokyamohana, (ii) Sarvāśāparipūraka, (iii) Sarvasankṣobhaṇa, (iv) Sarvasaubhagyadāyaka, (v) Sarvārthasādhaka, (vi) Sarvarogahara, (vii) Sarvarakṣākara, (viii) Sarvasiddhiprada and (ix) Sarvānandamaya, which correspond respectively to the (i) three–fold Bhūpura, (ii) the 16–petalled lotus, (iii) the 8–petalled lotus, (iv) the 14–angled figure, (v–vi) the two ten angled figures ( outer and inner), (vii) the octagon, (viii) the triangle and (ix) the Supreme Point or Bindu.

 The Baindava or inmost Chakra stands for the Mahābindu which represents the equilibrium ofŚiva and Śakti. This triangle is known as Ambikā and is within the Octagon. Its three sides consist of 15 vowels, viz. from **अ** to **अं**, and its centre is the letter **अः**. It is presided over by Kāmeśvara and Kāmeśvarī (i.e Prakāśa and Vimarśa or Śiva and Śakti), which are seated as it were on the asana of Sadīśiva or Mahābindu.

 (ii) The second section dwells upon the Mantra Sanketa. The nine Chakras spoken of in the 1st paṭala have each a presiding Deity, and a Mantra is really a "Ray of Chaitanya" **(चिन्मरीचि)**. It is socalled by virtue of its power of delivering **(त्राण)** a Jiva on being meditated upon. The nine vidyās are named. and this is followed by an account of their nyāsa in the human body. The Mantra Sanketa is sixfold, i. e. **भावार्थ, सम्प्रदायार्थ निगर्भार्थ, कौलिकार्थ, सर्वरहस्यार्थ** and **महातत्त्वार्थ.** Each of these is described at length.

 (iii) The third section treats of the Pūjā Sanketa, as already mentioned. The Pūjā or Worship of the Goddess is declared to be of three kinds, viz. (a) *Parā*, (b) *Parāparā* and (c) *Aparā*. Ths first represents Supreme Knowledge consisting in the realisation of the highest unity, i. e. identity with Parama Śiva. The second partakes of a mixed nature, being partly Karma & partly Jñana, and consists in the withdrawal by means of bhāvanā of the external chakras into the inner undifferenced Light. This is really a gradual elimination of action in the unity of knowledge. The third or lowest form of worship is of the external chakras, āvaraṇa, &c. It starts from the outermost plane or Chaturasra (square) andproceeds by degrees to the Central or Baindava Plane; in other words, it is the worship of the whole Śri Chakra, with all the *sadanas, dvāras, devas* and others. It is pure action and is confined to the world. of difference.

* The Edition:*

 The Mss. on which the present edition of Yoginīhṛdaya and its commentary is based have been already described in the 'Prefatory Note' in Part 1.

*  Conclusion :*

  It now remains for me to acknowledge with thankfulness my indebtedness to Pandit Nārāyaṇa Śistrī Khiste. Sāhityāchārya, Asst. Librarian and P. Jagannātha Śāstrī Hoshing, Sāhityopādhyāya, for helping me in reading the proofs and with valuable suggestions.
