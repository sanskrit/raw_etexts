**ERRATA**

In spite of the combined efforts of the editor and the publishers a few mistakes and misprints have crept in, e. g. वण (p. 6, 1. 2) for वर्णं, सुसस्याय (p. 11, 1. 13) for सुसस्यायै, KS. III (p. 28, 1. 11) for KS. IV, दुवस्यत् (p. 93, 1. 8) for दुवस्यत, धर्म (p. 108, 1. 12) for धर्मं.



**INTRODUCTION**

**THE KAPIṢṬHALA-KAṬHA-SAMHITĀ**

 The Caraṇavyūha enumerates among the Carakas—Kaṭhāḥ, Prācya-Kaṭhāḥ, Kapisthala-Kaṭhāḥ. Of these the Kaṭhas are well-known by their Saṃhitā, Śrauta-Sūtra (extensively quoted specially by [Yājñikadeva](# "*See my article ")), Gṛhyasūtra and numerous other treatises. The Prācya-Kaṭhas have long been [extinct.](# "**The Katha-Sūtra (Śrauta and Gṛhya) is known as Laugākṣi-Sūtra. There is no evidence, however, that Gāṅgi-Laugākṣi (Gotrapravaranibandha- kadamba, p. 180) was similarly connected with the Prācya-Kathas,")No references or quotations have yet been traced. The Kapiṣṭhala-Kaṭhas are known by a fragmentary ms. of the Saṃhitā. At the present day there are no followers of this school.

 Like many other śākhās, the Kap.-Kaṭha S. derives its specific designation from the ṛṣi, who founded the śākhā, Kapiṣthala, as the name of a ṛṣi is known to Pāṇini VIII,3,91 and the various Pravarasūtras, and there is little doubt that the

Kambistholoiof Megasthenes (Arrian, IV, 8) are our Kapiṣṭhalas. Durga, in his commentary on Nirukta IV, 4 says of himself: ahaṃ ca kāpiṣṭhalo vāsiṣṭhaḥ.

 The original home of the Kapiṣṭhalas can be ascertained by tracing the origin of the name Kapiṣṭhala itself. In all probability it is derived from Kapisthala, the modern



[Kaithal](# "Cf. the local word kaith (from Skt. kapittha)."), a small town situated 29° 48' N. and 76° 24' E., a few miles to the east of the river Sarasvatīin the region ofKurukṣetra. Local tradition ascribes its foundation to Yudhiṣṭhira. Alberuni (11th cent. A.D., India I, p. 206) refers to this town as [Kavital](# "Kavital points to Kavithal, the aspiration having been omitted."). Two centuries later Tīmūr describes the inhabitants as fire-worshippers, which means that fire-rituals were still practised here. The antiquity of the place is further authenticated by Varāhamihira (Bṛhat-Saṃhitā XIV, 4). The author of Kāśikā also seems to have known the town, for on Pāṇini VIII, 3, 91 he comments: gotra iti kim. kapeḥ sthalam

kapisthalam. The interpretationof this passage in St. Petersburg Dictionary **"Standort der Affen"** is wrong, for the singular kapeḥ can only mean the ṛṣi of that name (see Gotrapravaranibandhakadamba, pp. 57, 59, 60, 164, 172). For gotra names derived from the names of localities cf. Mādhyameyāḥ, Kauśāmbeyāḥ (ib. p. 32), Saindhavāyanāḥ (ib. p.93, etc.), Kaurukṣetriḥ (ib. pp. 59, 163).

THE KAPIṢṬHALA MS.

 The original ms. is preserved in the Benares Sanskrit College (10-3). It is written in Devanāgarīcharacters and is for the most part accented. As the authorities have never allowed its removal from the library, copies have been made at different times for the use of various scholars. Of the copies that have come to Europe, Weber's seems to have been the first. It was copied before 1880, and was used by L. von Schroeder for his edition of the Maitrāyaṇī-Samhita. Each aṣṭaka is separately paged. For the edition



of the Kāṭhaka-Saṃhitā L. von Schroeder used the copy of P. V. Bradke, after whose death it passed into the possession of F. Knauer. F. Kielhorn also had a copy made for himself in 1881 and later presented it to the Göttingen University Library (Skt. 2). It is beautifully written. It is divided in two parts. The first has 81 pages and comprises the first and the fourth aṣṭakas. The second has 68 pages which comprise adhyāyas 34-48. Every aṣṭaka begins with a new page. The last copy is Prof. W. Caland's copy, made in 1908. As in Weber's copy each aṣṭaka is separately paged, and like all other copies each aṣṭaka begins with salutation. It has besides, the following fly-leaf transcriptions:

 (1) kapiṣṭhala-saṃhitā-prārambhaḥ. 1-8 adhyāyātmakaṃprathamāṣṭakam.

 (2) caturthāṣṭakam. 25-32 adhyāyāḥ.

 (3) pañcamāṣṭakam. 34-40 adhyāyāḥ.

 (4) ṣaṣṭhāṣṭakam. 41-48 adhyāyātmakam. The ms. was mainly used by Prof. Caland for writing articles on the corrections in the Kāṭh. text in German Oriental Journals, e.g. Gött. gel. Anz. 1900 Nr. 9, Wien. Z.K.M. XXIII, XXVI, etc.

 In addition to these transcripts which have come to Europe there exist two others in India. After a careful examination I have found that their original could not be our Benares ms. and that possibly these two transcripts come from two different sources. For the reconstruction of the text, however, they do not afford any material help. One is now in the possession of the Asiatic Society of Bengal (ms. 16.E.1). It is written on 41 leaves in Devanāgarī characters. It is slightly worm-eaten and contains only the first seven adhyāyas complete, while the eighth finishes off with the last lines of the fortieth adhyāya. The colophon reads: iti kapiṣṭhala-kāṭha-saṃhitāyām catvāriṛśattamo dhyāyaḥ samāptaḥ...sa(ṃ)vat 1709 varṣe mārgarāśīrya vadi ravau likhitam idaṃpustakaṃvaṭṭorā



śrī 5 vīrajīsutaṃnārāyaṇajīkena likhāpitā śrīkruṣṇārpaṇa-budhyā śrīvārāṇasīsthitāya viduṣo pradattā. śrir cha śrī cha śrīḥ cha śrīḥ cha. The other transcript was recently procured for the Punjab University Library (acc. no. 2458) by the famous mss-collector R. A. Sastry. This is only the first 13 leaves, running up to haviṣya indri II, 16 (p. 24, 1. 3). The rest of the copy has evidently been lost. Of all these six mss. only those of Weber and Kielhorn are

accented.

 With the kind permission of Prof. Caland and of Göttingen and Punjab University Libraries I was allowed to examine their copies, while J. van Manen, the Secretary of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, obliged me by sending a detailed account of his ms.

CORRUPTIONS AND PECULIARITIES  
OF  
THE KAPIṢṬHALA MS.

 The ms. is full of clerical mistakes and without the help of Kāṭhaka and other Vedic texts it is not always possible to see the original readings through them. Besides corruptions such as are common to all badly preserved works, there are some peculiarities which deserve special [mention](# "For working this and the following sections I used Prof. Caland's and Göttingen University copies."):

\(a\) Lengthening of the final syllable—  
 revatyām, haviṣyām, jagatyām 1, 8 for revatyaṃ, haviṣyaṃ, jagatyaṃ (cf. Pāṇini IV, 4, 122 revatī-jagatî-haviṣyābhyaḥ praśasye); tanvāṃ 1, 8. VIII, 9. XXX, 8. XLVII, 6. 7 for tanvaṃ; tanvāḥ VII, 5 for tanvaḥ; punās I, 16 for punas; vīryāṃ XXX, I for vīryaṃ; asuryāṃ XXX, 5 for asuryaṃ; sarvadevatyāṃ XXXVII, 7 for sar-



vadevatyaṃ; enāṃ XXXVII, 7 for enaṃ.

\(b\) Interchange of ī, ai, yai—  
 rātrī III, 12. IV, 4 for rātryai; sajūr devīḥ sajūr devī vayonādhiḥ, vayonādhiḥ XXV, 10 for sajür devaiḥ sajūr devair vayonādhaiḥ, vayonādhaiḥ; but iṣtyai, pūrtyai VIII, 1 for iṣṭi, pūrtī; vibhaktyaiḥ VIII, 4 for vibhaktīḥ; dvaiṣaṃ XXXI, 2 for dvīṣam.

 Also gāyatryai XXV, 9 for gāyatryā.

\(c\) i for ṛ—  
 dhiṣṇunā XXVIII, 5 for dhṛṣṇunā; āchinatti XXX, 5 for āchṛṇatti.

\(d\) g for gh—  
gṛṇe XXVIII, 1 for ghṛṇe.

\(e\) -ymi for -jmi, -cmi-  
 saṃmāryṃi I, 10 for saṃmārjmi; pṛṇaymiIII, 4 (more than once) for pṛṇacmi (cf. var. lec. in MS. I, p. 36: H. pṛṇaymiṃ, M 1 pṛṇuymi, P praṇaymīti pra- naymi, MPaddh II S. 115. 139 praṇaymi); yunaymi XXIX, 4. XLVIII, 3for yunajmi. Cf. PañcBr. I, 2, 1 yunaymi (twice). Sāyaṇa remarks: yakāraś chānda-sārthaḥ. yunajmi ity evaṃ śākhāntarapāṭhaḥ. Cf. also further ayman I, 7, 6 for ajman. yunaymi is quoted in LāṭSr. ms. at Leyden.

(f)-ṃh-for-ṅgh-  
 aṃhāriḥ II, 7 for aṅghāriḥ. aṃhāriḥ occurs in ŚānŚr. VI, 12, 20 as well.

\(g\) Interchange of r and I—  
 kromno XLIV, 9 for Kāṭh. XXVIII, 9: 163, 10-11 klomno; sarirāXLVIII, 10 for Kāṭh. XXXV, 9: 57, 9 salilā; sīlam XXVIII, 8 for Kāṭh. XVIII, 8: 271, 17 sīraṃ; nimlodo V, 8 for Kāṭh. VII, 9: 71, 10 nimrado.

\(h\) In sections XXXVII, 8—XLIV, 9 the verbal termination -an has often been changed to -uṃs in front of the pro-



noun tad—āyums te, abruvuṃs tan, akurvuṃs tat, sama-bharuṃs tena XXXVII, 8; ajighāmsu(ms. yu)ṃs tāni XXXVIII, 1; upāyums tān (ter), niraghnu(ms. ghu)ms tas- mād XXXVIII, 3; ramerums tasmin XXXVIII, 6 (bis); ādums tā, abhavuṃs te XXXIX, 4; prāyuchuṃs tena XLI, 4; acaruṃs te XLII, 4; āsuṃs te XLIV, 9.

 Further see L. v. Schroeder's introduction to MaiṭS.

SANDHI

 The Kapiṣṭhala ms. presents the following variations from the Kāṭhaka [usage](# "See also MaitS. I, p. XXXIX,")—

 (a) Final a in hiatus is occasionally lengthened—tā ṛtavaḥ IV, 6; sāṛcchatu V, 2 (six times); imā eva V, 8 for ima eva; saṃvatsarā ṛcā VI, 5; lokā ṛdhyāVIII, 6; prayogā ṛṣiḥ XXX, 8; devalokā āhavanīyo XXXI, 4; upadhīyantā iti XXXI, 11; hitā ṛtūn, prajāyatā ṛtavyā XXXI, 12; avarundhā ṛbhūṇāṃ XXXI, 16; dakṣiņatā udañcaḥ XXXI, 17; cinutāṛdhnoti, cîyatā ṛtavā XXXI, 18; pitṛlokā ṛdhnuyām XXXI, 19; cinutā ṛdhnoti XXXI, 20; avarundhā ṛṣabheṇa XXXVII, 3; parājayāmahā iti, tā ṛtubhyo XXXVIII, 3; itāāhutiḥ XXXIX, 3; tā ādīyamānāḥ XXXIX, 4; digbhyā eva XXXIX, 5; vaiśvānarā upāvasṛjyate XL, 4; vidadhiṣyā (ms. ṣṭā) iti XLII, 3; unmucyamānā eti XLV, 43; lokā āpaḥ XLVII, 10; lokā āsan XLVIII, 8. As would be seen from these examples, the Maitrāyaṇīya rule that only the unaccented -e and -as followed by an accented initial vowel are changeable to ā, is not strictly observed in the few cases quotable from our ms.

 (b) Final au regularly changes into āv before an initial vowel. Of final e, o and ai changing into ay, av and āy there are very few instances—avaruṇadhāy i(ms. e)ti VI, 8; rucay eṣā VII, 5; tay enaṃVII, 8; vibhāvasav iti XXX, 3.



 (c) Final ān preceding a vowel has sometimes been reduced to aṃor amꣲagainst Kāṭh. āmꣲ—

 amṛtaṃanu I, 19; haviṣmaṃāvivāsati, haviṣmaṃastu II, 16; martyaṃāviveśa VI, 2; devahūtamaṃagne XXXIV; rudramꣲiśvaro XXXV, 5; madhumaṃindriyāvān XLVIII, 9; antaraṃamitrān XLVIII, 13. This usage accords with that of the Maitrāyaṇī Saṃhitā. But uttarān aśīya I, 13 for Kāṭh. II, 1:8,7 uttrāmꣲaśīya.

 (d) ḍ and ḍh between two vowels are thrice changed to and ḷh—  
 samulhaṃII, 4; mṛḷayanta III, 8; dūḷabho V, 2.

 (e) n in the first or second syllable of a word is sometimes changed to ṇunder the influence of r or ṣin the pre-vious word. This change is well-known to both our Saṃhitās. The instances in which the Kap. alone has changed n to ṇare—

 madhumatīr ṇah III, 1 (twice); mākir ṇo III, 8; indra ṇo III, 10; deveṣu ṇaḥ III, 11; oṣadhiṣu nyadadhuḥ IV, 1; punar ṇaḥ VIII, 2; asurā ṇānvavāyan XXXI, 8; deveṣu no XXXVI, 1. XXXIX, 5; strī ṇirvīryāṇirvīryaḥ XLIV, 8; prāṇyāni XLV, 1 for pra anyāni.

 But sumitriyā naḥ II, 15 for Kāṭh. III, 8: 27, 5 sumitrā ṇaḥ; pari no XXVII, 6 for Kāṭh. XVII, 16: 258, 22 pari no; punaryāmni XXXVIII, 1 for Kāṭh. XXIV, 8: 98, 21 punaryāmṇī.

 (f) The instances, where Kap. has changed as to s after an i or u are:—astu ṣma te VIII, 7; dhanuṣṭvaṃ XXVII, 1; triṣatyā XLVII, 4 (bis); agniṣṭvā XLVII, 11. Also antaṣ te III, 1; sūryaṣ țe XXVI, 9; videvaṣte XLI, 7.

 But vyastabhnāII, 4 for Kāṭh. II, 10: 15, 12 vyaṣṭabhnā; vispardhaḥ XXVI, 5 for Kāṭh. XVII, 6: 250, 1 viṣpardhāḥ; abhi sa XXVIII, 5 for Kāṭh. XVIII, 5: 269, 18 abhi ṣa.



 (g) The final is and us are sometimes changed to iṣ and uṣ before k and p, whereas the Kāṭh. reads iḥ and uḥ. Similarly Kap. retains as against Kāṭh. aḥ—viviśuṣ paruș XXV, 4; varivas kṛnotu III, 7; rajasas pāti XXVIII, 3; divas parjanyād XXIX, 4.

 But very often even within compounds is and us are found replaced by iḥ and uḥ—

niḥkṛtiḥ, niḥkaroti IV, 2; catuḥpada IV, 3; yajuḥkāryaṃ, niḥkṛtaḥ VIII, 3; niḥkartāraṃ XXV, 5; catuḥpāt XXVI, 3; niḥkevalyaṃXXVI, 7; niḥkṛtiḥ XXX, 5; jyotiḥpakṣā XXXIV; niḥpakvaṃXXXV, 7; niḥkrīṇāmi, niḥkreṣyāmahāXXXVII, 2; niḥkrāmati XXXVII, 5 (bis); niḥkrīṇāti XXXVII, 8, etc.

 Also jyotiḥ paśyantaḥ XXIX, 4 for Kāṭh. XVIII, 16: 277, 1 jyotiṣpaśyantaḥ, dviḥ pacantu XXX, 5 for Kāṭh. XIX, 7: 8, 10 dviṣpacantu; āyuḥ kurute XLIV, 5 for Kāṭh. XXVIII, 5: 159, 4 āyuṣ kurute.

 (h) The use of the candrabindu before a ś, ș, s, h or an initial vowel is not regular. Mostly the simple anusvāra is used instead. Once, however, the anusvāra preceding a y is changed to a candrabindu after the manner of the Maitrāyaṇīyas—āyatanavantamꣲ yajamānaṃXLIV, 3.

KAPIṢṬHALA VARIANTS

 Some of the important variations between the Kap. and Kāṭh. are—

\(a\) The use of parasmaipada for Kāṭh. ātmanepada, and vice versa—pratinudāmi I, 12. XLVII, 11 for Kāṭh. -nude; anūpatiṣṭhanti IV, 1 for Kāṭh. -tiṣṭhante; vidīvyanti VII, 4 for Kāṭh. -dīvyante; praṇudate XXXI, 17 for Kāṭh. -ṇudati; cinvīta XXXI, 18 for Kāṭh. cinuyāt; pratisthāpayate XXXV, 5 for Kāṭh. -ṣṭhāpayati; niḥkreṣy- āmahe XXXVII, 2 for Kāṭh.-kreṣyāmaḥ; śamayate XL, 3 for Kāṭh. śamayati; icchanti XLIV, 9 for Kāṭh. icchante.



 (b) The use of imperative forms for present indicative—

āhvayatu I, 12. XLVII, 11 for Kāṭh. āhvayati; pravahantu I, 13 for Kāṭh. pravahanti; pāntu V, 7 for Kāṭh. pānti.

 (c) Among other variants are to be noted—

audgrahaṇaṃ XXXV, 8 for Kāṭh. -grabhaṇaṃ; yātayāmnā XLVII, 2 for Kāṭh. yātayāmena; ātmeyānām ātmeyatvam, āpyeyānām āpyeyatvam XLVII, 7 for Kāṭh. ātmīyānām ātmīyatvaṃ, āpīyānām āpīyatvam.

 (d) Pratīkas. When a mantra has once been given in full, it is the usual practice of both our Saṃhitās to refer to it afterwards by pratīka. There are, however, several instances where the Kāṭh. repeats the complete mantra instead of giving the pratīka, as is done by Kap. See notes in III, 7. IV, 8. V, 2. VIII, 12. XXV, 1. 2. XXVI, 7. 8. XXVIII, 3. 4. XXIX, 3. 6. For instances of Kap.'s repetition of the mantra, as against the Kāṭh. pratīka see XXXI, 2 (prasadya bhasmanā...) and XXXIV (māteva putraṃ...).

 In XLVIII, 1-13 Kap. givesseveral pratīkas, in whose place Kāṭh. has full mantras.In Kāṭh. and our fragmentary Kap. ms. these verses do not occur anywhere else. It is very probable that they formed a part of the lost sections of Kap.

 (e) abhikrāmam eva hotavyam of Kap. IV, 4 appears in Kāṭh. VI, 5: 54,10 as—tad āhur abhikrāmam eva hotavyam. I have not been able to trace this injunction in either the Mait. or the Tait. Saṃhitā. Hence, in all likelihood, Kap. either preceded Kāṭh. or was contemporaneous with it.

ACCENTUATION

 On the whole the system may be said to be that of



Ṛgveda, in as much as the signs of the anudātta and svarita are respectively a horizontal line below and a perpendicular line above the syllable. The udātta is left unmarked. But it is only in adhyāyas I-III and XXV-XXIX, 7 that both the anudātta and svarita are fairly regularly marked. In adhy. IV-VIII the svarita is marked only here and there, while from adhy. XXIX, 8 onwards only the anudātta immediately preceding the accented syllable is marked. In adhy. XXVIII and XXIX a small circle underneath the syllable has sometimes been used to denote a secondary [svarita—](# "Cf, Schroeder's article on the accentuation of Kāṭh.mss. in Z.D.M.G. vol. 49, p. 157.")

 XXIX, 6 prati, punaḥ, yajñam no, noted by Schroeder (MS. I, p. XXXIX, footnote) do not appear with the circle in the Göttingen copy. Schroeder's copy had also a different sign for the primary at some places. svarita at some places.

 In the preparation of the present edition it was found inpossible to give an accented text, for that would have meant such a large number of emendations and filling up of blanks, that it could hardly have been said to be the original state of the Kapiṣṭhala accent.

KAPIŞṬHALA VERSION OF THE KĀṬHAKA  
PORTION OF TAITTIRIYA-BRĀHMAṆA III, 12

 The gap in Kap. XXXVI, 2-3 is filled up by a fragment of the Kap. version of the Kāṭh. portion of TB. III, 12. It is not accented. It begins abruptly with mano bhaviṣyaty anu svargaṃ lokaṃ, TB. III, 12, 4, 5. Then follow TB. III, 12, 4, 6. 7. III, 12, 3, 1-4. III, I2, 2, 1-3. Our ms. stops with taṃ brahmābravīt prajāp- TB. III, 12, 2, 4.

 The text preserved in our ms., though mostly indentical with that of TB., shows some omissions and variations, which are noted below:

YĀJYĀNUVĀKYĀS

 The yājyānuvākyās are scattered over the whole of Kāṭhaka Saṃhitā. They are appended to the several chapters as the last one or two [anuvākas](http://्र "A complete list of these anuvākas is given in Mantrārṣādhyāya, andmay be seen in Prof. Keith'sIntroduction to the TaitS. Translation, P. LXVIII."). Being meant for the use of the hotṛ, they should have no place at all in the Yājuṣa Saṃhitās, and much less at the end of the various chapters. In Mait. Saṃhitā they are collected in the Khila-Kāṇḍa. According to the Mantrārṣādhyāya and the colophon of the third book of [Kāṭh](http://्र "The colophon reads: asmin grantha-trayābhyantare yājyānuvākyā nāma caturtho granthaḥ."). the yājyānuvākyās formed the fourth



book of the Kāṭhaka-[Carakas](http://॑ "In the TaitS, the yājy, are similarly scattered over the first four books, while in the lost Ātreyi S., as its Kāṇḍānukrama informs us, these were all put together in the 21st kāṇḍa."). The Kap. S. rightly omits the yājyānuvākyā sections throughout. It is even doubtful if they ever constituted a part of a possible Khila-Kāṇḍa of the Kap.

KAPIṢṬHALA DIVISION INTO AṢṬAKAS AND  
ADHYĀYAS

 While the Kap. has nearly the same text as the Kāṭh., in its division into books and chapters it is entirely different. The fly-leaf transcripts in Prof. Caland's copy designate the books as aṣṭakas, every one of which begins with salution. The chapters named adhyāyas run continuously, just as the sthānakas in Kāṭh., though in Ṛgveda, Mait. and Tait. Saṃhitās the chapters are numbered separately in every book. The aṣṭaka-adhyāya division is only to be met with in the Ṛgveda. It is interesting to note here that the number of chapters in Vāj., Kāṭh. and Mait. Saṃhitās is 40, which is divisible into aṣṭakas.

 There are, however, two clear traces of Kāṭh. division in our Kap. ms. At the end of XXXVII, 1 and XLV, 1 the colophons are: dīkṣita nāma pañca prapāṭhakaḥ samāptaḥ, iti āyusthānakaṃdaśamaṃ prapāṭhakaḥ [samāptaḥ](http://॑ "The presence of the word sthānaka in the second Kap, colophon along with prapāṭhaka is puzzling."). These correspond to the colophons of Kāṭh. XXIII, XXVIII ...dīkṣitan nāma trayoviṃśaṃsthānakaṃ sampūrṇaṃ, āyuṣyaṃ nāmāṣṭāvimsaṃ sthānakaṃ sampūrṇaṃ. Thus each prapāṭhaka of Kap. was equal to one sthānaka of Kāṭh., and the first prapāṭhaka (of the second book) began with the 19th sthānaka, which likewise begins the Madhyamikā. This means that Kap. was also divided into three books, each of which unlike the Kāṭh., began anew with the enumeration of



its chapters, designated prapāṭhakas.

**OMISSIONS**

 The Kapiṣṭhala has omitted more than one hundred mantra and brāhmaṇa passages of the Kāṭhaka, mostly in the first aṣṭaka. There is little reason to suppose these to be simply copyist's mistakes. The same verse niṣasāda dhṛtavrataḥ..., occurring many times in Kāṭhaka, is read only once in Kap. brāhmaṇa (VII, 4) and there it is given in full. Again some of the Kāṭh. mantras not explained in the corresponding brāhmaṇa section are not noticed at all in Kap. See notes on Kap. I, 12, etc. When mantras are omitted, their explanations in br. are also wanting. **"Extensions"** of the mantras or the brāhmaṇa are also left out. These form a very considerable number of the omissions, e.g.

 pratyuṣṭārātiḥ (following pratyuṣṭam rakṣaḥ) Kāṭh. I, 2, etc; dhinuhi yajñaṃ dhinuhi yajñapatiṃ dhinuhi māṃ yajňanyaṃ (following dhinuhi devān) Kāṭh. I, 6; rāyas poṣāya supraja (I, 10 ā) stvāya Kāṭh. I, 6. 10; nirdagdhārātiḥ (following nirdagdhaṃrakṣaḥ) Kāth. I, 7; ājyasyājyam asi haviṣohavis satyābhighṛtam asi satyena tvābhighārayāmi (following sahasravīryaṃ asi tan mā jinva) Kāṭh. I, 10; te no 'vantu (following te naḥ pāntu) Kāṭh. II, 4; idam ahaṃyo nas samāno yo 'samāno 'rātīyati tasya grīvā apikṛntāmi (following idam ahaṃ rakṣaso grīvā apikṛntāmi) Kāṭh. II, 5. 9. III, 3; tṛptā mā tarpayata prītā mā prīṇīta (following gaṇān me tarpayata) Kāṭh. III, 10; cakravṛttaṃ anyad acakravṛttaṃ anyad (preceding yac cakravṛttaṃ tad asuryaṃ yad acakravṛttaṃ tad devapātraṃ) Kāṭh. VI, 3; ya evaṃveda Kāṭh. VII, 10. XIX, 10; pra śreyāṁsaṃ bhrātṛvyaṃ nudate prati pāpīyāṁsaṃ nudate Kāṭh. XX, 6. XXI, 2; yajamāne ca prajāsu ca (following ūrjam eva madhyato dadhāti) Kāṭh. XX, 7; nidānavān āyatanavān bhavati ya evaṃveda Kāțh. XX, 9; sāntir eva sã (following bheṣajam eva karoti) Kāṭh. XXII, 12. The elimination of these phrases and sentences



does not seriously affect the context.

ADDITIONS

  The Kap. adds very little to the Kāṭh. text. There are a few extensions, e.g.

 pitṛṇāṃbhāgaḍheyī stha Kap. II, 3; samrāḍ asi sapatnahā...(for rāḍ asi...) Kap. II, 5; varcodhā agne 'si varco me dhehi Kap. IV, 8; ya evaṃ veda Kap. XXXIV.

 The verse ghṛtenāgniḥ..., the same as ṚV. X, 118, 4 (with the change of samajyate to samidhyate), occurring in Kap. VI, 2 is not found in Kāṭh. Another verse cited by pratīka in Kap. VIII, 1 and not recorded in the Ved. Concordance, prajāpatiṃtvayā samakṣam ṛdhyāsam, replaces the Kāṭhaka verse ā mā gamyāḥ. The viniyoga remains the same in both the schools. svarge sadhiṣ ṭava, XLVIII, 13 is likewise unknown to the Kāṭh. and the Ved. Con. Another Kap. addition is ya āviṣṭaḥ XLVIII, 13.

**ṚGVEDIC INFLUENCE**

 The Ṛgveda has had a greater influence on the Kapiṣṭhala than on the Kāṭhaka. In orthography the anusvāra preceding a ś, ś, s or h has generally remained unchanged in our ms., while an intervocalic ḍ has thrice been changed to\]. The system of marking the accents is in principle that of the ṚV., which leaves the udātta unmarked. The division of the text into aṣṭakas and adhyāyas is after the manner of the ṚV., for no other. Saṃhitā shows this division.

 In the case of variations between the two śākhās the Kap. follows the ṚV. about fifty times, as against the Kāṭh. which has the Ṛgvedic reading only five times.

 For the evidence justifying the corrections the reader is requested to refer to the footnotes of the Kap. text.

 In the end it is a great pleasure to me to thank most cordially Professors R. L. Turner and W. Caland for having gone through my ms. and for making very valuable suggestions and corrections. To Prof. Caland, in particular, I am deeply indebted for the unique opportunity he offerd me of



staying with him for over eight months. It was in his study and with his friendly help that the work was begun, executed and finished. I only regret that he did not survive to see the book in its final form. With him the great line of venerable European Vedic savants has come to an end.

 I have also been highly obliged by the Librarians of Göttingen and Punjab University Libraries and Prof. Caland for lending me their mss. of KapS.

 I am obliged by the regulations of the London University to mention here that the Introduction and the first aṣṭaka of this work were presented to and accepted by the said University for the award of their Ph. D. degree.

IV, 17; Caturadhyāyikā I, 102, etc. According to the Māṇḍūkī Śikṣā (verse 101) the correct pronunciation of svarabhakti was like i, so that शतवल्शः was to be pronounced शतवलिशः. According to the Keśavī Śikṣā (Śikṣāsaṅgraha, p. 141) and Pratijñāsūtra (II, 3), however, शतवल्शः was to be pronounced शतवलेशः (Quoted in Dr. S. Varma's Critical Studies in the Phonetic Observations of Indian Grammarians, p. 136). Several of the MS and MānŚr. mss. read ०बलिशः, but I do not know of any which has ०वलेशः. Compare Pischel (Grammatikder Prakrit-Sprachen, pp. 103,104), who notes that in Prakrit i was the most common svarabhakti vowel besides a which appeared only in Ardhamāgadhī and Apabhraṃśa.")विरोह

 ४. KS. सुमनस्यायै। कृषिंऀसुसस्यां for सुसस्यायै. सुमनस्यायै, here as well as in XXIII, 4 is based on ms. Ch. only. The second ms. T 1 has the correct reading सुसस्यायै which is rejected by Schroeder. Cf. MS. कृषिंऀ सुसस्यामुत्कृषे, TS. कृष्यै त्वा सुसस्यायै, VS. IV, 10 सुसस्याः कृषीस्कृधि. कृषिंऀ सुसस्यां is omitted in KS. brāhmaṇa, which reads : कृष्यै त्वा सुसस्याया (thus corrected) इति तस्मात् कृष्टं पच्यते. उत्कृधीति तस्मादूर्ध्वा ओषधय उत्पच्यन्ते. Thus we see the possibility of the insertion of a marginal gloss into the text where उत्कृधि stood alone without an object in the accusative.

वि स्या ऋध्यता इत्युत्साद्य पुनरादधीत is inexplicable. This use of the pronoun त्मद्isvery common in the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa and very often the sentence expresses unfavourable circumstances. In KS, MS. and TS. quite a number of such instances can be noted: KS. XXIII, 2 (p. 75, 1, 1); XXIV, 9 (p. 100, 1.5 ); Ms. III, 6, 4 (p. 63, 1, 17); TS, II, 5, 2, 6; II, 6, 6, 1.

**VEDIC MYSTICISM.**

 Prof. Dr. Raghu Vira has picked up Vedic passages of unique charm and beauty and linked them together in an English version, at once superb and refreshing. Nothing of the kind has ever yet been attempted. Even the conservative school of Vedic scholars would find it delightful. Here is the hymn to the Life-Supreme:

**O LIFE I BIND THEE UNTO ME.[\*](http://See%20Atharva-Veda%20XI.%204,%2026d,%201,%202,%204cd,%205c,%2012acd,%201leda,%2015cd,%207ab,%208cd,%2022;%20XI.%207.%20lab,%203ab,%205b. "See Atharva-Veda XI. 4, 26d, 1, 2, 4cd, 5c, 12acd, 1leda, 15cd, 7ab, 8cd, 22; XI. 7. lab, 3ab, 5b.")**

 Obeisance to the Life, that controls this all,

 The Being who overlords all, in whom all is established.

 Obeisance to Thee O Life, obeisance to Thee crashing and thundering, flashing and pouring rain,

 Quickening the earth with life, gladdening the beasts,

 Repeating the constant cycle of days, nights, fortnights, months, two-monthly seasons and years,

 Making the universe throb.

 Life is immense. Life is the sun, the moon and the creator, the dispenser of bliss to the truthfull man.

 Verily Life Himself is death.

 Hail to Thee O Life, who envelops the past, the present and the future,

 Who advances forwards backwards, below and high, ever-revolvingeight-wheeled, single-rimmed, thousand-spoked.

 With Thine half Thou created the universe, and the other half overflows, where and how far who knows?

 Or it is in the overflow that the world of forms and name has its being.

 The existent, the non-existent, death and energy, and the music play their games in the overflow.
