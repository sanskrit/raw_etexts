 PREFACE

In my Introduction to the Samavidhana Brahmana I have announced my plan of bringing out the critical editions of the Samabrahmanas which are not avaible and also my intention to edit the Saman technical texts.While there have been editions of Samabrahmanas in Roman script and Devanagari brought out the Western and Indian Vedists, the vast Saman technical literature alone has so far remained utterly neglected, with no standard edition of any Laksana-Granthas.A notable exception to this is perhaps the Puspasutra that was brought out by Richard Simon in

1908, with text in Roman script and with a very learned introduction and German translation.This edition stands as a monument of infallible German Scholarship of Saman technical literature. He has also, of course, published the Pancavidhasutra, a minor work in this field, with German translation. But these works have long gone out of print. I intend bringing out all important Samalaksana-granthas, so far published or unpublished, in due course, in the Kendriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha series one by one.

 The Samavedarseyadipa is an important and rare work in this field and it is now being made available in print for the frist time. The work constitutes a systematic record of the metres, deities and rsis of the rcas and ganas of the Samaveda. This is an anukramani type of work of Samaveda and a very useful referencework for a chandoga and a researcher. But it concludes, like Arseya Brahmana, with Aranyaka.

 In this edition, I have arranged the text in such a way that it should be easier for any one to locate a verse or gana in the Samhita or Ganagrantha where one can find out the fuller text of any given verse or gana. The Appendices, A andB add futher to the reference value of this edition. The Appendix-A lists the names of melodies, Gramageya and Aranyaka, in one alpabetical order with referenceto the basic verses or yonimantras and to the rsis and Appendix-B provides the list of rsis of the rcas and ganas recorded in the work.

 The present edition is based on 4 manuscripts,-3 from the Manuscripts Libraries and one supplied by Shri R.Santanam Sastrigal. Ever since I made my interntion of bringing out the editions of Saman literature known to the learned public I have been getting all necessary co-operation and encouragement from the Manuscripts Libraries, Research Institues and Samavedins. I have, therefore, a great

pleasure in experssing my gratitude to them all.Lastly I have also to express my sincere apperciation of the good work done by the Bharati Vijayam Press, Madras,in printing this work.

 INTRODUCTION

The Work.

 Samavedarseyadipa, as the title indicates, deals with the rsis of the Samans melodized on the yonimantra of the Samaveda. The author, Bhatta-Bhaskara-Adhvarin, in the introduction to his works stresses the obligation, rather mandatary, on the part of a chandoga of knowing the name of the rsi, the metre and the deity of the rcas as well as of the samans sung by him.He quotes in support of this obligation, the famous passage from the Arseya Brahmana where also, it is said that the passage is a quotation from a Brahmana. This quotation is probably from a much older work universally accepted as an authority by the Vedists,-chandogas and others. According to this, one who is ignorant of rsi, chandas and devata of a mantra that one employs in a sacrifice or that one teaches to this disciples, will face dire consequences-स्थाणुं वर्च्छति, गर्तं वा पद्यति,प्र वा मीयते, पापीयान् भवति,-Further it is stated there that all his performances as a sacrificial priest or as a Vedic teacher will bear him no fruit, --यातयामान्यस्य छन्दांसि भवन्ति.

The author, moreover, quoting the Nidana-sutra, says that while the metre and deity of a rca and a saman are the same, the rsi of a rca and saman based thereon

does differ-ऋषयस्तु ऋक्सायोर्भिद्यन्ते। छन्दोदेवतयोर्न भेदः।.Therefore, an authentic record of the rsis of the samans for ready reference is of course called for. This need the author professes to fulfill in the Samavedarseyadipa (SAD).

 The Author then informs us that generally Agni for Agenya, Indra for Aindra and Soma for Pavamana are the deities;but whenever there are exceptions to this general rule, he assures us that he would expressly mention them in such places. He, thereafter, cites the metres of the verses chapterwise in the above three parvans as arraned in the Samhita. As for the Aranyaka there parvans as arranged in the Samhita. As for the Aranyaka there is no one common deity and no one common metre for the anuvakas. Therefore, while mentioning the rsis of the rcas and samans, the metre and the deity are also to be recorded in the Aranyaka section. This became necessary because while the Gramegeya part of the samans, strictly follows the order of the verses as they are found in the Sama Veda Samhita, the Aranyaka, thought draws on larger number of verses from the Aranyaka parvan, never follows the verse order of the Samhita. Further here the verses from the previous parvans viz.,Aindra, Agneya and Pavamana are also taken to be melodized. Therefore, it has bemcome necessary to mention the metre, the deity and the rsi of each verse before the respective rsis etc.,of the melodies are stated.

 The parvans are divided firs into, adhyayas and then into khandas. This is continued upto the end of the Pavamana parvan. But after this suddenly the author resorts to the anuvaka division. We have, however, stuck to the khanda division throughout in order to conform to uniformity.

 Whenever the deity of a rca differed from the common deity that belonged to the whole hymn, it is pointed out in proper places in the work. But this reference in many places is not given in the right sequence. Often the name of the deity of a rca when it differed, is given after attesting the rsi of a gana melodized on a particular rca. This is not correct. All the data regarding a rca should come in one place and in its normal sequence. We have, therefore, brought all these informations in right sequence in one place regradless of how it occurs in some Mss. We have, thus attempted to maintain the uniformity of statement throughout.

 There are evidence to believe that the SAD does not exclusively follow the Kauthuma recension. This causes sometimes confusion and even leads to wrong conclusion.For instance (1) in the Dauthuma recension the gana based on जातः परेण(SV.90)is called इन्द्रस्य प्रियम् and the rsi there of Indra. But according to Jaminiya recension this saman is known as sayoni (svayouni in SAD) and the rsi there of Kashyapa. The SAD here follows the Jaiminiya recension.

(2)The ganas melodized on ब्रह्माण इन्द्रम्(SV.439)are known as shlokas in Svadhyaya Mandala Edition (Sm)P while they are known as shlokanusnlokas in SAD. The Sm cites only two ganas but SAD three, based on this verse. Sm also cites two anushlokas but they are based on two subsequent verses, viz, 440 and 441-one on each. The SAD clearly follows the Jaiminiya recension in which three ganas by name of shlokanushloka are cited on ब्रह्माण इन्द्रम्. Again the gana based on आ याहिis known as maruta in both the SAD and the Jaiminiya, whereas in Sm it is
said to be vacah saman.

(3)The gana based on अनवस्ते (SV.440) is known as shloka in SAD and anushloka in Sm. But the Jaiminiya differes with the SAD in this respect.

(4)All the three samanas melodized on इन्द्राय पवते(SV.520) are known as somasamans in SAD whereas in Sm only the first and the third are called somasamans and the second svahprstham angirasam. But in SAD the saman named svahprstham angiramam is based on पुनानः सोम(SV.519). Here again the Sm calls the melody based on this verse as somasaman.

(5)In some place the SAD differs from both Jaiminiya and Kauthuma in respect of rsi of rcas.For example the rsi of एतो न्विन्द्रम्(SV.350)is विश्वामित्रो गाथिनःin Sm but in SAD it is tirashcih . Here as well as in some more other places SADfollows the Rgveda. Again the rsi ot the verse कदा चन(SV.300)is Valakhilyas but Sm gives here a different name.In a few places the rsi of the gana also differs,for instance the first of the five ganas also based on तं वो दस्मम्(SV.236)is known as navika and the rsi there of is prajapati both in Sm and Jaiminiya. But in SAD the rsi there of as navika. Again the rsi of the second gana i.e. abhivarta is Prajapati in both SAD and Jaiminiya. But Sm here differs. It says it is Abhivarta.

(6)The rsi of the gana based on उप नो हरिभिः(SV.150) is Prajapati and the gana is designated as सुतंरयिष्ठीय after the nidhana of सुतंरयिष्ठाः. But the SAD cites the name of the rsi who composed the ganas as Sutamrayistha. There are instances in the SV were the rsis are known by some phrase occurring in the verses themselves; for instance the rsi of प्र वो महे (SV.462),as also of gana melodized bereon, is named as Eyavayamarut (atreya). Similarly the rsi of the gana melodized on तरत् समन्दी(SV.500) is called Taranta or Taratsamata. These are actually not the real names but the names acquired later by the rsis who composed these verses or ganas.

(7) According to the SAD the rsi of the 10th hymn(verses 437-446) of ChapterIV in Aindra parvan is Vamadeva whereas according to Sc it is Trasadasyu. Similarly SAD cites Rudra as deity of the verse प्र वो महे (SV.462)while Sm cites Marut.

8.The SAD says that the verse जज्ञानः सप्त (SV.101) was taken from the Pavamana-इयमृक् पवमानादुद्धृता।(p.16.L.7);but it does not seem to be right. In Sm this verse is found only in the Agneya parvan and not at all in the Pavamana.

 We have referred to these differences of opinion in respect of rsis and deities as found in Sm and SAD in the foot-notes as also in the Appendix-A.All these facts go in favour of the opinion that the SAD does not exclusively follow any one recension of the SV. The SAD differs with Sm, in many places, so does it with Jaiminiya. These points are discussed in the Critical Notes in relevant places.Maybe, it was following a different recension and this becomes evident from the introductory verse. आर्षेयभरत( ) सामानुसारतः। . Unfortunately no available Mss help us any way to fill up the gap.

The SAD does not normally give the alternative names of the ganas nor does it give any detailed information about the arrangement, composition etc., of the samans. It is a simple, methodical and orderly record of the rsis of the rcas and ganas. It also records, wherever it is warranted, the metre and the deity. It should be noted here that the rsi of a rca and saman often differs but not the metre and deity. Therefore, for each verse and gana melodized hereon the names of the rsis are expressly mentioned. As regards the metre and the deity in Gramageya it is normally said at the beginning of a khanda or a set of khandas which have common deity and a metre . When this is not the case, the deity and the metre are mentioned ater such verse.But since the Aranyakagana does not select the verses in the serial order from the Samhita each verse may have different deity and the metre. Therefore, the deity, the metre, and the rsi of each verse is stated separately and as for gana the rai only. Here since the metre and the deity, the verse and the gana based thereon do not differ, they are not repeated but it is said there ऋग्वच्छन्दोदेवते. However,if the deity differs for both it is expressly stated. As regards staubhikagana the question of metre does not arise since the stobhas often constitute only phrases or sentences sung in different musical notes.Therefore, only the rsi and the deity are mentioned. The SAD in this connection clearly says ऋगभावान्न च्छन्दः.

 The SAD does not normally observe the abhinihita-sandhi or purvarupa-sandhi and in this respeet it follows the Vedic grammar.We have also the sandhi like

संवर्तो आङ्गिरसः(p.26.L.12 vide CN) in this work.This kind of sandhi is not warranted in classical literature. But we find it used in Saman literature here and there.(Vide शुनः शेपो आजीगर्तिः Sm.p.10.under sixth dashati). Again the SAD reads तमूवभि(Sm.383, p.55.L.10)spelt with glide व् instead तमूअभि.Though the glide य् and ब् after इ and उ followed by a vowel is heard in pronunciation, they are not normally splet in writing. This is the reason why this glide is technically called yashruti or vashruti in Pratishakhya. The grammarians like Vyadi and Galava have recongnised and also accepted this spelling in such vocalic junctures and for writing as well.

 The SAD gives sometimes more information that is not recorded in Sm.For instance the SAD gives the exact name of the dvipada metres for each verse in the 10th khanda of fourth chapter in the Aindra-parvan. But the Sm cites dvipada-virat as the metre for all the 10 verses in this khanda which is not correct.

 Arrangement

1 Grama-Geya-gana:

 In the Gramageya the verses are given the serial number in brackets immediately after the pratika. This will enable us to know the total number of verses in the respective khandas.

 At the end of each paragraph the continous serial number of the Grama-geya-ganas is given in brackets. If there are more than one gana on a yonimantra that is also indicated in the brackets. The number marked with two dandas on both sides at the conclusion of the paragraphs indicates the serial number of the verses as found in the Sama-samhita. Thus one can understand at a glance the total number of verses melodized in each khanda, the running serial number of the relevant verses in the Samhita. With the help of this device one can easily locate a gana or a verse in the Ganagrantha or the Samhita of the Samaveda.

2.Aranyakagana:

 The Aranyaka-ganas are based on the verses mostly taken from the Aranyaka-parvan of the Purvarcika of the Samaveda. Yet there are a good number of ganas in this section which are solely based on the verses taken from the previous three parvans viz.Agneya,Aindra and Pavamana. While in Gramageya the ganas strictly follow the numerical sequences of the verses as arranged in the Sama-samhita, in the Aranyaka the ganas utterly neglect this sequence. Further the same verses sometimes form the basis i.e., the yonimantras for several different ganas widely separated. Again there are several ganas which are not at all based on a verse but on what is known as a stobha. Therefore, the Aranyaka could not follow the verse sequence as found in the Samhita for its arrangement of the melodies.

 In this division the paragraphs in each khanda are assigned with separate serial numbers. The verses on which the ganas are melodized are given their locationnumber in SV.And lastly the ganas are assigned with the continuous serial numbers.At the conclusion of each paragraph upto that point the toral number of verses, on which the ganas have been melodized is given in between the two dandas on each side. The special featrue of the Aranyakagana is this:--here all the ganas are not necessarily based on the verses; there are ganas based entirely on what is known as stobhas, words and phrases-coined or composed for this purpose.Such ganas are known as anrcam sama or more popularly as staubhikam ganam and are endowed with supreme potency of spiritual numbers after the total number of the verse marked with+. This will indicate at each stage the total number of verses and stobhas which have formed the basic mantras, whether rcas or stobhas, for the elaboration of the Aranyakasamans.

Thus one can, at a glance, learn the total number of verses as also ganas in each knanda, adhyaya, parvan etc, in the Gramageya and in the case of Aranyaka the total number verses and stobhas in the khandas and at last in the whole parvan. A Author

The author Bhatta-Bhaskara-Adhvarin as we understand from the introductory verses, belonged to Kashyapa-gotra. Apart from this nothing is known about him so far.There were several Vedic authors by name Bhaskara, but we have no evidences to identify our author with any one of them.

 There are only four introductory verses in all the Mss with common errors and gaps. It is evident that there must have been some more verses since the expressions in these verses are not continuous and the sentences are not complete. We are thus deprived of whatever little information we could have hadf about the author from the introductory verses . He refers to the Pratihara and Arseyakapla sutras, which have been commented on by Varadraja of the Kaushika gotra. The transcript kept in the India Office Library was made out of a manuscript dated C.1600.This would show that the author lived prior to the 17th century.

 Materials

The following Mss were utilised for bringing out the present edition:

1.L. India Office Library, London, B.505 from Burnell's Collection. A transcript in grantha made out from a manuscript belonging to one V.R. Sastri of Kumbakonam as we understand from the note written by Burnell himself in the transcript ("Transcriber from an olai Ms. (C.1600)in the premises of V.R.Sastri, Cumbaconum")2.B. Palm leaf Ms in Grantha No.9792 from the Oriental Institute, Baroda.

3.My. Transcript of paper Ms. No.SA312 in Grantha supplied by the Oriental Research Institute, Mysore.

4. S.Transcript in Grantha supplied by Shri R.Santanam Sastrigal, Ammal Agraharam, Tiruvaiyaru, Tanjore.-only the Aranyaka.



Among these 1-3 appear to be from the same source. They are having gaps and errors in common. The transcript supplied by Shri R.Santanam Sastrigal is the most accurate.

 CRITICAL NOTES

 p.1.L.5

The introductory verses lack continutiy of thought and expression and in some there are lacunae in between. The sentence in the first verse is without a verb प्रकीर्त्यते of the second verse either. Similarly the second verse has no direct relation with what is expressed in the first and the same may be said about the remaining verses too.On the whole what the author wanted to express is not clear. From all this it becomes clear that some verses were lost from the introductory verses.There should have been at least one verse in between the verse वेदसाम्नम् and काश्यपान्वय.....in order to complete the expression and link it with the following.Normally a work of this type does not begin without invocation. Therefore, what we strongly feel is that the available Mss.of Samavedarseyadeepa are the descendants of an archetype which was damaged and broken.The subsequent transcripts did not take notice of the lacunae and of the missing verses. (Correction:--यज्वना is to be deleted from the foot-note.)

 p.2.L.2

This is a qutoation from the Arseya Brahmana.The passage संस्थानो भवति is omitted in all Mss. The sentence in the ABr. is संस्थानो भवति ब्रह्मणः We have, therefore, restored the passage, omitted by the scribes.

 p.3.L.2

All the Mss have left out the colophon इत्याग्नेयं पर्व of the preceding parvan and have mixed up the commencing words of the first sentence of this parvan and of the colophon of the previous.While restoring the colophon to the last parvan , we have also corrected the caption and the commencing sentence of this parvan. p.5.L.10

MyBL तत्साम्नमग्निः। श्राभा श्र्नोष्टीये. The readings are wrong and corrput in all these Mss. The sentence should have been तत्साम्नोः श्र्नाभाश्नोष्टीययोः अग्निः, if the general pattern of the sentences used in this work was followed.We have, therefore, corrected the readings,but, however, without changing the order of the words in the passage.

 L.15

In MyBL. after मेधातिथिः we come across the lines इयमग्निमा(र्मा B)रुती। अग्निमरुतौ देवता, which appear to be out of context in view of the author's earlier avowed statement that in gramageya he would record separately only the names of the rsis against each rca and gana but not their deities and metres since these arealready stated in the beginning of each chaper or Section. We have, therefore, removed these lines from the text.

 p.L.19

The name of the rsi of both the versesऔर्व भृगुवत् (सा.18)and अग्निमिन्धानः(सा.19)is प्रयोग and not प्रयोगिन् as found in MyLB.We have, therefore,written the name correctly.

 p.7.L. 15

MyLB गायत्र्या (L.त्र्यै)खण्डे त्रय ऋचः

We have corrected this passage as गायत्र्यां खण्डत्रये ऋचः

 p.10.L.14

The name of the rsi of the gana ऐतवर्द्धिय as given in Mss.is वार्द्धियश्व while in the Jaiminiyha Arseya Brahmana this gana is called( ऐतवृद्धः)ऐतवृद्धम्-गानम्). We have, therefore, corrected the name as ऐतवर्द्धिः.According to the Svadhyaya Mandala edition(Sm.) the name of the rsi is ऐतवर्द्धि and of the gana ऐतवघ्रय.

 L.16

L नेडश्च MyB.नेदश्च दोहस्य मन ऋषिः . The reading are corrupt in all three Mss.In the Sm.the name of the verse as well as of the melody is given as doha-दोहः दोहो बृहत्यग्निः-In the Jaiminiya version this saman is known as मनसश्च दोहः. Thereofore, correct readings should be साम्नो नेडस्य(orनेद्धस्यif we accept the reading from either of the Mss;otherwise दोहस्य.)

 p.13-L.18

MyLB. साम्नोर्यामयोः यमः ऋषिः This sentence is apparently wrong because there is only one gana based on त्वेषस्ते धूमः (सा.83)Therefore, it is possible that साम्नो यामस्य was altered by the scriber as साम्नोर्यामयोः (साम्नोर्यामस्.साम्नो यामस्य )in the archetype from which the transcripts were made out. At the end of the आग्नेयपर्वन् the authour says that ther are 114 verses and 180 ganas altogether in this parvan. This figure could be correct only if we count only one gana, -and not two---on त्वेषस्ते धूमः. We have, therefore,corrected the reading as साम्नो यामस्य.

 p.14.L.13

The saman melodized on the verse जातः परेण (सा.90)is called इन्द्रस्य प्रियम्, and the rsi therof Indra in Sm edition. But the Jaimlnya version says that the saman is सयोनि and the rsi therof is Kashyapa. It is clear that if Sm edition is not wrong, the SAD follows here the Jamilya version.

 p.17.L.10

साम्नोः पार्थयोः सौभरयोरपत्यः सौभरिः ऋषिः. In Sm edition the name of the rsi is given as पक्थ while in Jaiminlya version as पथ. Therefore, according to the Sm. the passage should be साम्नोः पाक्थयोः (orपाथयोः according to Jaiminlya) सौरभयोः पक्थः(or पथः according to j.)अपत्यः ofSAD seems to be a corruption of पक्थ or पथ.

 p.19.L.3

त्रयोऽध्यायः. This is found as तृतीयऽध्यायः in all Mss. which is wrong. The author enumerates the adhyayas, anuvakas and rcas that occur in the Aindra parvan.Therefore, the correct readings could be only त्रयोऽध्यायः.

 p.23.L.5

त्वाष्ट्री साम्नः त्वाष्ट्री ऋषिः. In Sm the name of the rsi of this Saman given is as त्वष्टा and not as त्वाष्ट्री. But from the name of the Saman त्वाष्ट्री could be accepted as the name of the rsi as well,
---त्वाष्ट्याः साम.

 L.13

The name of the rsi of the ganas known as सुतंरायिष्ठीय melodized on उप नो हरिभिः(सा.150) is Prajapati . These ganas are so named after the nidhana of सुतंरयिष्ठी 2345:which comes at the end of the second gana in the coulpet. Therefore, the name of the rsi given in SAD does not seem to be correct.

 L.20

पूषा ऋषिः। सोमः पूषा च देवता। साम्नः सौमापूषस्य सोमः पूषा च देवता। The rsi of the verse सोमः पूषा(सा.154)accrding to the Sm is शुनः शेपो आजीगर्तिः । वामदेवो वा and the deity therof is Indra. The first सोमः पूषा च देवता। -is obviously a scribal error cmmitted by the scribes was due to optical illusion. He wrote सोमः पूषा च देवता before as also after साम्नः सौमापूषस्य. But the scribes must have corrected ऋषिः from the riginal sentences as देवता for, it musut to have occured to them that after rsi the deity mus follow. And this correction was carried to the second देवता as well without any thought, and with all innocence.

 p.25.L.12

The rsi of this verse as given in Sm is प्रियमेधः आङ्गिरसः and not प्रयिमेधः अभिप्रपाच्यः. This may be a scribal mistake.

 p.26.L. 1

All the Mss read दध्यनकिद्दाथर्वणः which is wrong. We have corrected it as दध्यङ्ङाथर्वणः in cosultation with Sm.

 L.12

संवर्तो(सुवर्तो)राङिगरः is the reading found in Mss which we have corrected as संवर्तो आङिगरसः, a sandhi of this type is not uncommon in this work. The repha migh have been inserted after संवर्तो by the scribes after the manner of संवर्तयोरिन्द्रः of the previous line or it might have been corrected by adding repha to आङ्गिरसः because otherwise संवर्तः cannot become संवर्तो in sandhi.

 p.30.L.12

श्रुतकक्षः The rsi of the verse अरं त इन्द्र श्रवसे (सा.209)as given in Sm is वामदेवो गौतमः and of the previous i.e. of श्रुतं वो वृत्रहन्तमम् (सा.208)is सुकक्षः . But all the Mss have only श्रुतकक्ष as rsi for both there verses.

 ;.31.L.20

All the Mss read विश्वामित्रो जमदग्निर्वा in place of प्रस्कण्वः काण्वः .This is an instance for the error that occurs in transcripts due to optiocal illusion or carelessnes of the scribes who copied part of the previous line in place of प्रस्कण्वः कण्वः . We have, however, in consultaion with Sm corrected the readings.

 p.32.L.14

Here also the above scribal error has been repeated. In place of कौत्सस्य कुत्सः, we have बार्हदुक्थस्य बृहुदुक्थः in all these Mss.

 L.18

The above mistake has been again committed in respect of और्ध्वसद्मनस्य ऊर्ध्वसद्मा by wrongly inserting कौत्सस्य कुत्सः in its place.

 p.33.L.9

षडशीतिशतं साम्नाम् is wrong. There are 196 and not 186 ganas in this adhyaya. Therefore, it should be षण्णवतिशतम्. The scribes may have changed it just to suit the metre.

 p.34.L.2

त्रिभिस्त्रेष्टुभ्यः. In the sentence the words, all except त्रैष्टुभ्यः signjifiying different metes are in substantive and not in adjectival forms. If we conform to the style of the sentence this also should be त्रिभिस्त्रिष्टुभः. However, we have not changed the reading for reasons that all Mss have only त्रैष्टुभ्यः.

 L.15

The first of the five ganas based on तं वो दस्ममृतीषहम्(सा.233)is known as नाविकand the rsi therof as प्रजापति in Sm. But the SAD says that name of the first gana is नाक and the rsi thereof नाविक.Similarly the name of the rsi the second gana i.e, of अभीवर्त according ot Sm is अभीवर्त while according to SAD it is प्रजापतिः. The Jaiminly School supports the Sm in respect of name of the first gana but as for rsi of the second it says it is प्रजापति--(नाविकं च प्रजापतेश्चाभीवर्तैः। JABr. III.I.3). The SAD differs in this respect in a few places . This shows that it is not strictly following the Kauthume version or only one version.

 p.36.L.10

Accoridng to Sm altohether five ganas are developed on the verse त्वमिन्द्रयशा असि.Among these four are known as इन्द्रस्य यशः, and one as साध्र. The JABr.enumerates five ganas in this context out of which the first three are साध्र and the following two समीचीन and प्राचीन respectively (साध्राणि त्रीणि। विरुपस्य समीचीनप्राचीने द्वे JABr. III.2.6), whereas the SAD mentions only a total of two ganas melodized on this verse, both being as इन्द्रस्य यशः with an alternate name of साध्र for the second.

 At the conclusion of the third chapter the SAD does not give the total figure of ganas enumerated therein as is done in the case of the previous two chapters. It gives only the total number of rcas or yonimantras.Therefore, it is not possible to ascertain the authenticity of the statement mentioning only two ganas there. In the absence of the varinats in the MSS we have to accept the readings as thery are. But in this case there will be a difference of three in the total number of ganas in the parvan.Since the ABr also counts five ganas we believe that the redaings in SAD here are wrong and corrupt. The text therefore should be साम्नामिन्द्रस्य यशसां पञ्चानाम् इन्द्र ऋषिः। तत्र द्वितीयं साध्रं वा.

 The Sm simply says that four are इन्द्रस्य यशः but immediately the second gana in the series interferse in the sequence with a different designation. This edition has not made it expressly celar which four are known as इन्द्रस्य यशस्.It says at the heading of the first gana इन्द्रस्य यशश्चत्वारि सामानि which should normally mean that the four consecutive ganas bear this denomination. But to third is said to be alternatively साध्र with समीचीन in brackets and the fouth and fifth are named as यशः, with प्राचीन in brackets for the fourth only. From this it apperas that समीचीन and प्राचीन are the epithets of the following ganas. I hold the editorial mistakes responsible for this counfusion, because according to the ABr the first two are इन्द्रस्य यशस्, the thrid साध्र,and the fourth and fifth समीचीन and प्रचीन. According to this the second has an alternate name साध्र and the fouth and the fifth इन्द्रस्य यशस् (इन्द्रस्य यशसी द्वे । साध्रं वैनयोरुत्तरम्। साध्रं चैव । विरुपस्य समीचीनप्राचीने द्वे। इन्द्रस्य च यशसी ॥ABr.III.2.6).

 p.37.L.16.and 19

The संशान samans are said to be four but actually sung in two ganas. The first is entirely made up of stobhas sung in three samans or lines. These three lines begin with three stobhas viz., (1)सान्त्वहिन्वन्ति(2)सन्त्वाऋणन्ति and (3)सन्त्वाततक्षुः and conclude with three sotbhas viz,(1)संश्रवसे (2)विश्रवसे)and (3) सत्यश्रवसे respectively. The second gana begins and concludes with the stobha सन्त्वाशिशन्ति ....with the rca बृहदिन्द्रा गायत inserted in the middle. Now the text of the whole parahgph is corrupt in all the three Mss,we collated for this edition.We have, therefore, emended the readings.

 p.38.L.4

The reading forund in all three Mss is वाचे (MYB)or वाचें(L)which is not correct. The ris of these two ganas is वाम्र after whom the ganas are named. We have, therefore, emended the word as वाम्रे.

 p.41.L. 16

The author has promised that wherever there is exception to the general rule in the case of devata or chaandas, he will paritcularly mention it in such places. Otherwise the deity stated in the beginning of the chapter prevails over all verses in that chapter.Now the author says that the deity of the verse यदा कदा च मीढुषे (सा.288)is Varuna. But we do not find support to this statement in the Samhita, where the deity इन्द्र common to all verses in this chapter becomes applicable to this verse as well.

 p.44.L.1-5

All three Mss have omitted the passages from कुष्ठः को वाम् to अश्विनावेव ऋषी.This is obviously due to the optical illusion coused by the identity of last passages of the parahraphs Nos.304 and 306. अश्विनावेव ऋषी is found at the end of both these paragraphs. The scribe unwittingly left out the passages upto अश्विनावेवऋषी wrongly identifying the previous अश्विनावेव ऋषी with the concluding passage of parahraph 306. This omission is common with all three Mss which indicates the common origin of these Mss.Because of this common heritage of errors in all three Mss we have to seek external evidences for setting the errors right.The omitted portion has been restored by us in square brackets.

 L.-6

All Mss wrongly cite प्रस्कण्व,the rsi of the previous verse, as the rsi of the following,i.e. of त्वा सोमस्य गल्दया(सा.306)as well. This is again due to the scribal error,not unsual in such circumstances.

 --L.20

All Mss read बृहत्योऽशीतयः meaning eighty brhatis. Here अशीतयः plural, is wrong. If this is not a scribal mistake, it will betray the poor knowledge of Sanskrit grammar of the author.

 p.45.L.4

Again all three Mss have omitted the text after पृक्षः ऋषिः upto the end of ऊरुक्षयः ऋषिः evidently a scribal mistake happened due to the oversight and carelessness.We have added the left out portion in square brackets.

 --L.17

 P.49.L.19

The rsi of the verse एतो न्विन्द्रं (सा.350)as given in Sm is विश्वामित्रो गाथिनः.But according to the Mss MyBL.It is तिरश्रीः which is in conformity with the Rgveda. Again all the Mss cite वसिष्ठ as the alternate rsi of the shuddhashuddhiyas. This is in accordance with the ABr.

 P.52.LL.16-19

The passage from त्यमु वो अप्रहणम्(सा.357)to दधिक्रा ऋषिः are omitted in all Mss. We have, therefore, restrored these in square brackets.

 P.52.L1.1-2

All Mss read रजतः for जेता which may be a scribal error. The name of the gana, as given in Sm is मारुत and the rsi thereof is मरुतः.The SAD, however, cites इन्द्राणी for the first, and मित्रावरुणौ for the second verse.

 P.53.L.2

The name of the deity of the verse अमी ये देवा स्थन(सा.368)is given as देवामवाः in MyLB.But from Sm we understand that it is विश्वेदेवाः.The reading of the Mss is obviously corrupt.

 L.18

The name of the rsi of the verse समेत विश्व ओजसा (सा.372)is given as सवेदाः शैलूषी in MyLB which is a corruption of सुवेदाः शैलूषी. The scribe has evidently transferred this here from the preceding verse by oversight.We have, therefore, on the authority of Sm corrected it as वामदेवो गौतमः.

 P.55.L.10

तमूवभि(सा.382).In places where i or l or u or u is followed by a vowel, the glide y or v as the case may be, is found inserted in between in SAD.Though this sandhi is un-Paninian yet not entirely prohibited by the grammarians.व्याडि and गालव among the orthodox grammarians have sanctioned this sandhi for the pot-Vedic Sanskrit (vide इकां यण्भिर्व्यवधानं व्याडिगालवयोरिति वक्तव्यम् भाषावृत्ति 6.1.77)as well. This rule appears to have been accepted by SAD in some places or atleast the variant readings having this sandhi were preferred by SAD.We have, however, accepted the standard spelling as found in Sm in this respect.

 P.63.LL.2-3

The SAD cites वामदेव as the rsi of the sukta (verses 437-446)whereas Sm says that it is त्रसदस्यु.Again the SAD mentions the exact name of द्विपदा metres against each verse but the Sm cites only one meytre i.e.द्विपदा विराट् for the whole hymn, which is no correct.

 L.10

In Sm the ganas based on ब्रह्माण इन्द्रम् (सा.439) are known as shlokas and they are only two. The two anushlokas are melodized on अनवस्ते(सा.440)and शं पदं मघम् (सा.441)respectively. The two vacah samans which follow are based on सदा गावः(सा.442)and आ याहि (सा.443).Thus there are four ganas known as shlika and anushlika, the first two being based on one single verse and the latter two on two different verses. The SAD does not fully agree here with SM.It follows the Jamilnya recension in this respect wher shlokanushlokas are mentioned to be only three.But this, unlike SAD, does not speak of a shloka based on अनवस्ते (सा.440).

 There are some confusion in the relevant sequence of these ganas here also.The gana based on आ याहि (सा.443)is known as मारुत both in JABr and SAD (cp.JABr.IV.10.3-4).

 P.67.L.1

All three Mss have एवयामरुद्र for एवयामरुत. In Sm the name of the rsi of the verse, प्र वो महे (सा.462)is given as एवयामरुदात्रेय. It may be seen that the word.एवयामरुत् occurs in the above verse and this has been taken as a name of the rsi, perhaps a kind of nickname. The deity of the verse according to SAD is रुद्र while according to Sm it is मरुतः.

 P.72.L.19

All three Mss read तरत्समन्तस्य वैतदश्वेः साम्नः whereas according to Sm it is तरन्तस्य साम.The word तरन्त or तरत्समन्त is evidently taken from the verse तरत् स मन्दी धावति(सा.500)and वितदश्व or more correctly विददश्व might be the name of the rsi of this gana.But in Sm तरन्त is the name of the rsi and this name is not qualified by वैददश्वि. We have accepted तरन्त as the correct reading for reason that तरत् स मन्दी consists of three separate words and that such conbibation of a group of words for naming a rsi of gana is not common.

 P.74.L.11

MyBL चतुर्थस्य पदासे।तयोर्वसिष्ठः ऋषिः॥. The passage is corrupt. We have, therefore, set them right in consultation with Sm.

 P.76.L.12

Accoring to SAD all the samans based on इन्द्राय पवते मदः(सा.520)are known as somasamans. But according to Sm only the first and the last are the somasamans and the middle one is स्वः पृष्ठमाङिगसम्. The SAD further says that the gana based on पुनानः सोम जागृविः (सा.519)is स्वः पृष्ठमाङ्गिरस whereas according to Sm it is known as somasaman. Neither the ABr nor the JABr supports this assumption of SAD. See also fn.10.p.76.

 P.77.L.11

Though the thiryrrn ganas based on तिस्नो वाच ईरयति(सा.525) are marked in Sm only three are enumerated in the serial numbers. Similarly ganas based on अस्य प्रेषा (सा.526)are said to be six but serially numbered only two. Some confusion occurs here about the designation and division of ganas based on तिस्रो वाच ईरयति and on the subsequent verses of the khanda in ABr. This will be dealt with in the Introduction to the Arseyabrahmana.

 P.87.L.12

There are altogether 119 verses in Pavamanakanda but the last verse is not included in the gramageya ganas.

 P.89.L.14

According to the Mss BMyL there are two ganas based on पिबा सुत (सा. 239) which are known as देवस्थान and बृहद्देवस्थान and the rsi thereof is said to be वरुण. Futher, the gana based on बृहदिन्द्राय (सा.258)is, according to the readings of the Mss, desiganted as ऐरय.

 There are three pairs of ganas running in continous serial order and each pair having identical names but based on different verses. The first of these are devasthanas, second airaya and airina and third angirasas. The SAD makes a wrong statement here that both the devasthanas are based on पिबा सुत (सा.239)and that the gana bsed on बृहदिन्द्राय(सा.258) is airaya. According to Sm there is only one gana by name devasthana melodized on पिबा सुत the rsi of which is वरुण. The second devasthana based on बृयदिन्द्राय is designated as brhad-devasthana and the rsi of which is प्रजापति. The gana airaya is melodized on पुनानः सोम (सा.511).

 It is clear the paragraphs 5 and 6 of SAD got mixed up somehow and wre wrongly copied. Hence this confusion. We have, therefore, set the sentence in both the paragraphs right and rearrnged them.

 P.98.L.5

The verses आ क्रन्दय and प्र यच्चक्रम on which the four of the five पविमन्ति ganas are melodized are not found in SV, either Kauthuma or Jaiminiya. The Sm gives the text of these two verses with padapatha and as belonging to a rudra-sukta. The passage अन्यायाः पदगीतमेकं साम as found in MyBSL means that the other rca(i.e.,प्र यच्चक्रम्) consists of one padagana.The Ms S adds another sentence i.e., प्रथमायाः पदगीतमेकं साम before this, which was obviously added by some scribe, for, according to this there should be two separate padagitas whereas we have only one padagita covering both the rcas.It may be observed in this connection that though three are two rcas, they are, for the purpose of enumeration counted as a single unit in Sm and assigned only one number. Therefore, we persume that अन्यायाः might have been wrongly written for अनयोः. Morecover, the next sentence तस्य शर्व ऋषिः refers to only one gana. This makes quite clear that both these constitute only one padagita. Therefore, the correct reading appears ot be अनयोः

 L.10

अग्नेर्हरसी वा. Ale Mss read अग्नेर्हरसंज्ञेः.Since the actual name of the gana is हरस् the readings should be either अग्नेर्हरः सज्ञे or अग्नेर्हरसी. But because the sentence एवं नामानि just follows these sentences, the word संज्ञ'or'नाम'after the name of the ganas is not warranted. Therefore, we believe अग्नेर्हरसंज्ञे was wrongly written in these MSS. It may be seen that there are many omissions and mistakes in the text here. We have se them all right by adding in square brackets the words and passages that were dropped by the Scribes.

 P.111.L.18

The MSS say that there are two rsis viz.,भरद्वाज and ऋजिश्वन् for this verse. But actually there is only one i.e.,ऋजिश्वन् the son of भरद्वाज. Therefore, we have changed the readings as भारद्वाजः ऋजिश्वा ऋषिः

 p.124.L.5

The Mss read इन्द्र ऋषिः । देवता च which is not correct. The deity of this gana is सूर्य. We have, therefore, corrected the sentence by adding सूर्यः in square brackets.
