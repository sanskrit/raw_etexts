FOREWORD.  

——————

 For a long time the publication of the Pārānanda Sūtra was intended for the *Gaekwad's Oriental Series* because of its immense importance in the realm of the Tantra, but as there was only one copy of the work available in the manuscript library of the Oriental Institute at Baroda the work could not be taken up in hand so long. It was Swami Trivikrama Tirtha who for the first time showed an immense interest in the work and actually produced a second copy of the work from his own collection. Materials for the critical edition thus having been secured the publication of the work was taken up, and is now being presented as No. LVI of the *Gaekwad's Oriental Series*. The editor Swami Trivikrama Tirtha is a remarkable personality, and combines in him the qualities of a Yogin, a Tāntric, a philosopher, a scholar of the S'astras, and a critical student. His vast knowledge of the Tantras, and his wide experience of Tantric practices have been brought to bear upon the production of this tiny little volume, and the critical student of the Tantras will find in it much that is interesting, much that is stimulating and much that is refreshing.

 The purpose for which this Foreword is written is not merely to contradict the learned editor, but to make an attempt to find out an approximate date in which the Pārānanda Sūtra was written, and to determine the position it occupied in the history of the Tāntric literature. The learned Swamiji will place the composition of the present work very early, and ascribe to it an antiquity which seems quite inconceivable. He further finds materials in the present work which lead him to suppose that the Tantra should be classed along with the Vedic Kalpasūtras most of which belonged to a very early period.

 Very few people however have any idea as to the extraordinary significance of Iconography in determining the antiquity of Sanskrit works in general and Tantric works in particular: or even, how materially the mention of certain deities helps a great deal in correctly dating works relating to Tantras and other cognate subjects. In the Pārānanda Sūtra the author persistently makes an attempt to give it the appearance of great antiquity so that it may be regarded as a work of the highest authority. But



it has been shown [elsewhere](# "Sādhanamālā, vol II, Introduction, see p.3. Origin and Development of Vajrayana, pp. xxii ff.")that the Tantras are of a very recent origin and even the earliest of the works now extant cannot go back under any circumstances beyond the 2nd or the 3rd century A. D. There are certain clues in the body of the book to show not only that the Pārānanda Sūtra is a product of recent origin, but also that, though written in the Sūtra form, it cannot go back to a time when even the earlier Tantras were composed.

 The Pārānanda Sūtra [mentions](# "p. 29. Sūtra, 20, तदुदरतोऽन्यतः सर्वतः अचिन्त्यैश्वर्यावग्नीषोमो।")

for instance, Agniṣoma and thus refers to the famous Pañcarātra doctrine of Akşara Brahma, which has been inculcated in all Pāñcarātra Samhitās, particularly in the Ahirbudhnya and Jayākhya Samhitās. The Pañcarātras hold that Para Brahman being restless with superfluous energy transforms himself in the form of Agni and Soma representing the long and short vowels of the [alphabet](# "See Jāyakhyasamhitā, introduction, pp. 24, 25; and text— प्रकाशस्तु भवेत्सूर्य आह्लादः सोम उच्यते पुमान् स एव चिन्मूर्त्तिरग्नीषोममयो द्विज॥p.58 षोडशाक्षर आद्यस्तु अकाराद्यो द्विजोत्तम विसर्गान्तः स्थितस्तस्मिन्ननीषोमात्मकः प्रभुः॥ p.42")

. Soma is called Joy while Agni or Surya is called Light (Prakāśa). The combination of the short and long vowels is therefore given the name of Agnīsoma, and they are considered to be the embodiment of the highest god Brahman, and even the creator of the principles like Mahat, Ahaṁkāra, etc. Agniṣoma are regarded as the creator, maintainer and destroyer of the universe. They are therefore named

as Pumān. From Pumān are originated the Vyañjanas or the consonants of the alphabet and the creative Tattvas beginning with Mahat and ending in the Earth. This Pumān while presiding over the Pradhāna or Primordial matter becomes conscious of his possession, wants many more things to create, and thus obtains the name of [Puruşeśvara](# "See ibid, intro. pp.24, 25")

.

 Now the doctrine of Akşara Brahman as has been shown in the Foreword to the Jayākhyasaṁhitā is, in a full fledged form, a product of the [5th century A. D](# "For the date of the three Pañcarātra Jewels including Jayākhya, See introduction to the Jayākhyasamhitā,pp.26 ff,")., and as the Pārānanda Sūtra



mentions this, the work cannot have a greater antiquity than the time of the Pāñcarātra Samhitās, one of the chief novelties of which is the theory of the Aksara Brahman.

 The Pārānanda Sūtra, moreover, in the course of the book mentions several deities, refers to a large number of Tantric sects, and names many preceptors and authors. The very fact that in the time of the composition of the Pārānanda Sūtra there were such Tantric sects as the Gāṇapas, S'āktas, Sauras, S'aivas and the Vaiṣṇavas as mentioned on p. 45 shows at once that the present work is decidedly later than the time when these schools of Tantra had evolved and become quite popular and well-known. The philosophical tenets inculcated in this Tantra, particularly of Jivātman, Is'vara, and Paramātman have a peculiar affinity towards the doctrines preached in the Buddhist Tantras where the parallels of the three above mentioned are represented by the Bodhisattvas, Dhyani Buddhas and the S'unya. The characteristics of Paramātman to agreat extent coincide with the characteristics of S'ünya as found particularly in the Mahāsukhavāda which is the very essence of Buddhist Tāntrism. Moreover, a perfectly Tantric atmosphere permeates throughout the book, because all the paraphernalia of Tantra are found stated therein, namely, the Mudrās, Mandalas, Mantras, the S'akti, the Vāmamārga, the five Makāras, and what not. The Dakșina Mārga of the Pārānanda School corresponds with the Kriyātantra and the Caryātantra of the Buddhist Tantras, the Vāmamārga corresponds with the Yoga Tantra where S'aktis are permitted to the worshipper and the Uttaramārga is the parallel of the Anuttarayogatantra of the Buddhists where no restriction, no rule and no custom or tradition may be binding on the worshipper. It may be observed in this connection that the earliest reference to S'akti worship or the ascetic having recourse to Yoga practices with the help of women are met with in the Guhyasamāja Tantra. This Tantra is in the form of a Sangīti where Vajradhara is introduced in an Assembly of the Faithful and delivers a sermon essentially on this point showing the necessity of women in the Tantric practices. When he preached this new doctrine there was a chorus of disapproval from among the audience who denounced the speaker for having said something very repugnant to them. The speaker did not reply but sat in Samādhi and from his person issued destructive



rays of light and when the rays touched those who denounced they all fell down from their seats senseless. The other members, who readily believed in him and implicitly put faith in his new doctrines, were saved from this disaster. These members requested the speaker to revive the dead and in compliance he sat in another Samādhi, and when the rays issuing from his body touched the unconscious members they were revived and sat again on their seats; and in the meanwhile they could realize what they could not understand through words of mouth. The mention of the Vāmācāra and permission given to the ascetics to take recourse to women cannot be earlier than the time of the composition of the Guhyasamāja, which has been shown to be circa 3rd century A. D. The practice of Yoga in the company of women was made a special feature in the Tantras that came after the Guhyasamāja and was the very part and parcel of the Tantra, particularly of the Vāmācāra, Yoga and Anuttarayoga Tantras.

 There are other reasons for considering the present work to be the product of a very late period. In the body of the book several deities are mentioned, and among them the mention of [Kurukullā](# "p.11, sūtra 65; p.37, sūtra 93"), Tārā as a [Mahāvidya](# "p.37, sūtra 94; ताराद्या महाविद्याः सिंहस्थाश्च।"), Kālikā or [Mahākālī](# "p.11, sutra 47; p.11, sutra 65; p.37, sūtra 93; p.65, sūtra 41."), and the Mahāvidyās beginning with [Tārā](# "p.37, sūtra 94; p.11, sūtra 47")is noteworthy. Now, for determining the date of the present Tantra these names seem to be of the highest value. Kurukullāis a deity accepted in Buddhism and this deity is bodily taken in the Pārānanda Sūtra. This adds to the already long list of deities borrowed in the Hindu pantheon from the pantheon of the Buddhists. That the more important among the Mahāvidyās such as Kālī, Tārā, and Chinnamasta acknowledged by the Hindus are Buddhistic in origin has been amply proved by a comparative study of the Hindu and the Buddhist [Tantras](# "Buddhist Deities in Hindu Garb in the Proccedings of the Fifth Oriental Conference at Lahore,Vol.II,pp.1277 ff."). Further, it has been shown that the different forms of Tārā, namely, Ugrā, Mahogrā, Vajrā, Kālī, Sarasvatī, Bhadrakali and Kāmes'varī are included in the Hindu pantheon though they are purely Buddhist in origin. It has also been shown that Mañjughoṣa, whose worship is even in the present day current, is a purely Buddhist deity though acknowledged in



[Hinduism](# "Ibid, pp. 1290 and 1296"). Furthermore, the deity Bhūtaḍāmara who is described in the Buddhist Tantras as an expert in destroying the pride of such gods as S'akra, Brahmā, Kubera and [others](# "Sādhanamālā,Vol II.p.512 शक्रब्रह्मकुबेरादिमदविध्वंसकोविदम्। श्रीभूतडामरं नत्वा.................॥"), though included. in the Hindu pantheon is really Buddhist in [origin](# "The Cult of Bhūtaḍāmara, read before the Sixth Oriental Conference at Patna 1930."). Pārānanda Tantra includes Kurukullā who is a purely Buddhist deity as a Hindu goddess, and it is necessary therefore that the origin and history of the conception of this deity should be traced with the materials at present available.

 Those who are acquainted with the Buddhist Tantra know very well that Kurukulla as an emanation of the Dhyani Buddha Amitabha is a powerful and influential deity in the whole of the Buddhist pantheon. The Sadhanamālā which has been published already in the Gaekwad's Oriental Series contains no less than twenty [Sadhanas](# "of.cit.Vol.II.Sadhana Nos.171-190")devoted to the worship of the Buddhist goddess Kurukullā. She is conceived in several forms and these are named as Tārodbhava Kurukullā, Bhramarīyoga Kurukullā, Uḍḍiyāna Kurukullā, S'ukla Kurukullā, Svādhisthāna Kurukullā, Hevejrakrama Kurukullā, and so forth. These Sadhanas are composed by various authors among whom we find the names of Muktaka, Indrabhūti, Kṛṣṇapāda, Sahajavilāsa, Siddha S'abarapāda and Karuņācala.

 Among the authors above mentioned Muktaka must have belonged to a period not later than 1100 A.D.,as the Sadhana composed by him appears in the Cambridge manuscript of the Sadhanamālā which bears a date in the Newari Era corresponding to [1165 A.D](# "Sadhanamālā Vol.II; intro.p.cv.")

.

Karuṇācala, the second, twice mentions Līlās'ani or Līlāvajra as his preceptor, and we know from other sources that Līlāvajra flourished about A.D.741. Being his disciple Karuņācala may be placed approximately at A.D.753 taking twelve years' average for one succession between a Guru and his [disciple](# "op.cit.Vol.II.intro.p.xcix.")

. Indrabhūti who has also composed a Sādhana for Kurukulla is a famous personality in the history of Tantric literature as the king of Uḍḍiyāna and as the father of Guru



Padmasambhava who went to Tibet to reform the State religion there and built the first regular monastery at Samye along with his brother-in-law and collaborator, the famous S'āntārakṣita. Indrabhūti owing to these reasons has been placed in cir. [A.D.717](# " Ibid, intro. p. xcVIII. See also Two Vajrayāna works, Iintroduction pp. xiff."). He wrote several works among which the Jñanasiddhi has already been published in the *Gaekwad's Oriental Series.* Besides Indrabhūti there was another Siddhācāryya who is credited with the authorship of a Sadhana for Kurukulla. He is Kṛṣṇācāryya popularly known as Kanhupā. This Kṛṣṇa was born of a Brahmin family of Orissa and was initiated into the mystic cult by Jalandharīpā. Kṛṣṇa's disciple was a weaver. He was a great composer of verses in vernacular and several of them have been published in the *Bauddha Gān O Dohā*by Mahamahopadhyaya Haraprasad Shastri. Kṛṣṇācāryya was a disciple of Jalandharīpā and must have flourished in about [717 A. D.](# "Sādhanamālā, întro. p. LIII,")

 But the name of S'abara amongst the authors of Sadhanas devoted to Kurukulla is the most important in determining the date of the introduction of the deity Kurukulla in the Buddhist pantheon. S'abarapa as is well known is one of the earliest Siddhācāryyas so far known, and is the disciple of Siddha Nagarjuna. He is described as having belonged to the hill tribe called the S'abaras or huntsmen in Bāngālā where he met Nāgārjuna and embraced Tantrism. Besides being a writer on Sādhanas he is also credited to have composed many melodious songs in his own vernacular which have also been published in the *Bauddha Gān O Dohā* already referred to. He, being a disciple of Nagarjuna (645 A.D.), must have flourished in the middle of the seventh [century](# "Ibid, vol. II. intro, p. XLVI.").

 From the above it becomes quite clear that Kurukulla was well-known in the middle of the seventh century when S'abarapa flourished. But his Guru Nagarjuna does not refer to the deity Kurukulla though Tibetan translations of a large number of works composed by him are still preserved. Saraha the Guru of Nāgārjuna likewise does not mention Kurukulla although a large number of his works are still preserved in Tibetan translations. Kurukulla is, before the time of S'abara, nowhere mentioned. We do not find her either in the Āryamañjus'ri-Mūlakalpa or in the Guhyasamāja which are the earliest works on Tantra so far traceable.



Therefore according to the materials now at hand the deity Kurukulla cannot be placed earlier than the middle of the seventh century. Therefore, the Pārānanda Tantra which mentions Kurukulla cannot have an antiquity earlier than the same period.

 Moreover, the Pārānanda Sūtra mentions Tārā as a Mahāvidya. It is well-known that the Hindus recognized ten Mahāvidyas in the form of ten deities. They are known as Mahāvidyās because their Mantra is able to confer Siddhi or perfection when muttered one hundred-thousand times. The list of Mahāvidyās includes among others Tārā, Kālī, and Chinnamasta. It has already been shown that Tārā cannot have an antiquity earlier than the time of Nagarjuna (645 A.D.) who restored the Sādhana of Ekajata from the country of [Bhota](# "Ibid.vol.II.intro.p.xlv. आर्यनागार्जुनपादैर्भोटेषु उद्धतम्।"). This Ekajaṭā in her four-armed form is known as Mahācīnatārā, her parallel being the Hindu deity Tārā as a Mahavidya. It has also been shown that Kāli, Kālikā or Mahākāli is another form of Tārā and is included in the list of the ten Mahavidyās. And in fact, the Hindu Tantras mention that Ugra, Mahogrā, Vajrā, Kālī, Sarasvati, Kāmes'vari, Bhadrakālī are only the different manifestations of the same deity Tārā who has been imported from [Buddhism](# "Buddhist Deities in Hindu Garb,op.cit.p.1290."). In-deed the name of Tārā is met with in the [Guhyasamāja](# "In the course of publication in the Gaekwad's Oriental Series,p.137.")but there she is the consort of the Dhyani Buddha Amoghasiddhi in the Dhyani Buddha Mandala and is mentioned along with other Buddhas'aktis Locanā, Māmakī, Pāṇḍarā and Aryatārā and is certainly different from the Mahācīnatārā which is an importation of Nāgārjuna of the Tantric fame. If the Tārā of the Mahavidyā variety cannot go back beyond the time of Nāgārjuna, Kālī certainly should be later, firstly because she represents a modification of Tārā, as also because the Buddhists did not give any attention to this new deity and never mentioned her.

 Similar is the case with Chinnamastā who is also included in the list of the ten Mahavidyā deities. She is the same as the Buddhist deity Vajrayogini for whose worship a new cult was introduced by S'abarapa the Siddha. As S'abara flourished in about 657 A.D., the origin of the deity Vajrayoginī may be placed in about the beginning of the 7th [century](# "See Sādhanamālā vol.II,intro.pp.CXLII ff, Buddhist Deities in Hindu Garb,op.cit.pp.1292 ff. And for the time of Sabara(i)pā see Sādhanamālā vol.II,intro.pp.xLv1 ff.").



 But the conception of the ten Mahāvidyās amongst the Hindus must have been a later one, because the list includes many new deties such as Bagalā, Mātangī, Dhūmāvatī and several others who are not known in Buddhism. Looking to the fact that the Buddhists were the first to develop Tantras, and that the deities like Tārā, Kurukullā, etc. were all Buddhistic in origin, and that none of them is older than the middle of the seventh century, the conceptions of ten Mahavidyās forming a group must be placed considerably later, at least not earlier than the 9th century, allowances being always made for the interval of time for the Buddhist deities becoming famous and well-known so as to find a place in the Hindu pantheon. Also, looking to the strained relation of the Hindus and the Buddhists in the Tantric period it can be easily surmised that a considerable length of time must have passed before the Hindu mind could be prepared to accept purely foreign deities into their own pantheon. In fact, this was only possible when Buddhism was destroyed at the advent of the Muhammadans.

 It seems therefore probable that the Pārānanda Sūtra must have been composed not earlier than A. D. 900, and probably after the Muhammadan conquest of Eastern India. The manifest purpose for which the Pārānanda Sūtra was composed seems to be to unite the Tantric religion with the Vedic. Now, the Tantras were for a long time regarded in the orthodox circles of Brahmins as something very impure because they were not based on the Vedas, and verily, for this the Tantrics even to-day suffer from a sort of inferiority-complex at the hands of the orthodox. The author of the Pārānanda Sūtra seems to have realized this defect and made a great attempt in harmonizing the teachings of the Tantra with the Vedas and Vedic literature with quotations from many authorities who are manifestly connected with the Vedic lore. He quotes many Vedic passages as authorities for the doctrines preached by him. This is seldom found in any other Tantra, and surely Pārānanda Sūtra stands as a unique monument in the realm of Tantras as having made a vigorous attempt to give a Vedic origin of the Tantra S'āstra.

INTRODUCTION.  

——————

 Before beginning to write anything by way of introduction, I feel it my first and fore-most duty to thank my learned and esteemed friend Dr. Benoytosh Bhattacaryya for asking me to edit the Pārānanda Sūtra for the *Gaekwad's Oriental Series.* But for this kindness on his part, it would not have been possible for me to give a substantial account of the Pārānanda School, which was entirely unknown so long,

 The edition is based on only two manuscripts of the work, one in the collection of the Oriental Institute and the second in my own collection. A third copy is understood to have existed in the collection belonging to the famous Kavindrācārya [Sarasvati](# "See List of MSS. belonging to Kavindrācārya Sarasvati published in the Gaekwad's Oriental Series as No.17."),

the learned and much-respected scholar who lived at Benares during the reign of Emperor Shah Jehan; but as the collection is no longer traceable, it was not possible to utilize it in this edition.

 Of the two MSS. available for editing, the one belonging to the Oriental Institute, Baroda, is well written and mostly correct. It is designated as अ. The other MS. belonging to my private collection was obtained by courtesy Pandit R. A. S'astri and is designated as न. This too, except in one or two places is fairly correct. As the portion wanting in one was supplied by the other, it was foundpossible to prepare a critical edition with the help of these two MSS. only.

 The Sutras have been given a continuous and running number, and a list of the names of the Acāryas or Tantrik authorities quoted or referred to in the book has been appended at the end.

 It is hazardous to say with certainty when and where the author Parānanda Muni flourished, owing to the dearth of historical material. But, as can be gleaned from [internal](# "p.92 Sūtras 31-33.")evidences it may be stated that he was a contemporary of king Sudarsana of the Solar dynasty; whose time, in the light of recent researches, is taken to be between 2400 B.C. and 1800 B.C. Sudars'ana, as can be seen from the list given in the sixth Ahnika of the Uttara Adhyāya, appears as the last in chronological order



![](../books_images/U-IMG-1725002896Screenshot2024-08-30125744.png)

 Though the names Khadgapras'niddha and Yamaparakrama sound as of later origin, we cannot say so with any certainty, looking to the fact that in our ancient literature, the patronymic names, nick-names and even epithets are found to be freely used for real names of persons. It is quite possible that the above names, which appear to us to be of recent origin, may belong to any of the above classes. Moreover, we have no more proofs for asserting their late or recent origin, unless it is that they sound so to our ears. Pārānanda Sutra occupies a unique position among the Tantrik works printed up to the present day, as it represents the Kalpasūtra of a new S'ākhā; and it is likely to become a subject of keen interest and study owing to this very reason in the eyes of such among the learned scholars who wish to make a comparative study of Tantrik works. The work is also valuable because it supplies about fifty important names of Tāntrik Ācāryas and works. If the names are examined, we shall find that they are mainly divided into two classes: one referring to Acaryas who were famous and whose names are familiar to us; and the other to the less familiar or less famous persons who lived very probably in the time of our author. Those, who are referred to, by name, may be classed under four groups. The first group consists of names ending in Bhairava; the second consists of names ending in Agni; the third group consists of names ending in the names of the deity worshipped by the Tantrika; while the fourth consists of names ending in Ananda. Those with Bhairava endings probably belonged to the Bhairava sect of the Tantriks. This school must have once occupied a highly prominent position, as can be inferred from the S'antisukta of the Tantrikas in which the words: "Bhairavo'ham S'ivo'ham" are



frequently repeated. The second group which consists of three names ending with the word Agni probably represents Brahmin names; as it is a system existing even now in some Brahmin families to name their sons after the initiation ceremony with some names or other ending with the word Agni. This was perhaps an age-long practice among the orthodox people and is supported by the Vedic passage 'Āgneyo vai Brāhmaṇah'. The third group consists of 14 names and they all end with the name of the worshipper's deity. It may be mentioned here that the system of naming the disciple at the close of the Dikṣā ceremony after the deity existed in olden times and exists even to-day. This system was perhaps the outcome of the S'astric injunction common to both the Vedic and Tantrik worship that the worshipper should, for the worship of the deity, first identify himself with it. From the above, it appears that even in such remote times as our author's, there existed at least in some parts of India the worship of the different deities in the Vedic style. The fourth group of names ending with the word Ānanda probably represents the Ācāryas who preceded the author Parānanda. There are 34 such Ācāryas mentioned by name by our author in this book to state their views in those places.

 Besides names appearing in four groups as above, there are twelve instances in the book, where [others](# "p.20,78th sūtra.")views on the same subjects are stated, without specifically mentioning their names. The value of the work is thus enhanced in as much as it details the views of many Ācāryas on important and contested points; which were favourable in certain places to those of our author and in others antagonistic to or different from those held by him.

 As in the Vedic Kalpasūtras, so also in the Tantrik Kalpasūtras the ritualistic portion is usually more than any other subject dealt with in an extensive manner. In works like Paras'urāmakalpasūtra, S'änkhyāyanakalpasūtra, Bharadvājakalpasūtra, Agastyasūtra etc., the philosophy is also treated, though in a brief and cursory manner, along with the ritual consisting of Upāsanā and the details connected therewith. But in none of the above works do we find anything about Rajadharma or Varņās'ramadharma. In the Pārānanda Sūtra on the contrary nearly one-fourth of the book explains the Acāra, Prayas'citta and Rajadharma; another quarter of the book deals with the philosophy of the Pärānanda sect; while in the remaining portion the author makes a vigorous attempt according to the necessities of his age to rescue people from Himsā or injury to animals, Vedic or otherwise. And this is done in a forcible and convincing manner, as can be seen from the impressive style of the language used in several [places](# "vide sutras 34-71 on pp.92-94.")in the book.

 There are, of course, some places in the book first sight agree even remotely on any single point in



expressed by our author. But when the views are minutely examined and the significance of the terse and epigrammatic sentences used by our author understood, we come to a different conclusion altogether and begin to believe that our author makes a sincere attempt to guide the followers along a right [path](# "p.13 sūtra 4.")instead of misleading them with false doctrines.

 There are three paths described in the pages of this book as leading to the goal defined therein and they are styled as Dakṣiņa, Vāma and Uttara. As a full and clear treatment of every one of these paths is given in the book, we do not think it necessary to describe them here.

 The readers will find from the contents that there are mentioned in the book several simple and easy methods to benefit one's self as are found wanting in other Tantrik works of a similar character. These methods are specially recommended to the readers both for careful [study](# "PP, 85-87.")and practice, so as to ascertain the truthfulness or otherwise of the statements made therein.

 Hundreds of Tantra works have been printed and thousands of such works still exist in manuscript form in several collections in India. In all these works embracing different faiths like the Vaisnava, S'aura, Ganapatya, S'aiva and S'ākta cults, the principles of the respective faiths along with the different modes of worship for the attainment of the goal are described in detail. But the Pārānanda Sütra differs completely from all the important works of different faiths in almost all details like the Dikṣā ceremony, mode of worship, and the philosophy inculcated in it. In short, everything of it is different from that found in other works. It must be admitted that such an important work like this has been discovered and published in the *Gaekwad's Oriental Series* out of the sheer good luck of the devotees.

 Let us now take a bird's eye-view of the philosophy contained in the book. The author believes in three classes of Cetanās: Paramātmā, Is'vara and Jiva. Paramātmā is one, Is'varas are seven, six or five, while the Jivas are countless. The number of the Is'varas varies according to circumstances. When Brahmā and Bhairava are considered as Jiva and part of S'iva respectively, the Is'varas should be counted as five only. When one or the other is not considered as a separate Is'vara entity, then the Is'varas should be counted as six.

 The Sūtra further lays down that if a man does not follow the path of Dharma or duty he goes to hell, and if he does virtuous deeds he goes to heaven. If he makes the Upāsanā of an Is'vara, he attains the abode of that Is'vara. If non-believers believe in their own S'astras and follow them, they get merit and through this merit, they get their next birth in an Astika family which believes in Vedas, God, etc. After being born again like this, they become fit to study the Astika S'astras or the Sciences of the believers.



The Science of the Astikas falls under two heads, the Samiskāra S'astra, and the Matas'astra. The former treats of religion or ritual and the latter treats of Metaphysics or the nature of the soul, Is'vara, Paramātmā and Mukti, or liberation from bondage. According to the Sūtra, one who follows closely the Saṁskāra S'ästra becomes fit for the Matas'astra and then begins to experience the stages of development explained therein. It is after this only that one can be considered as having become a member of the Pārānanda Mata, or the Pārānanda School.

 There are three paths advised in the Pārānanda Mata, namely (1) Dakṣina (2) Vāma, and (3) Uttara, the right, the left and the highest respectively.

 Daksina-mārga is that which insists on following the S'rutis, Smṛtis and Purānas. Vāma is that which insists on following the S'rutis and the Tantras; and the Uttara-mārga is that which insists on following the S'Țutis and the Guruvākya, or the word of the Guru.

 According to the Pārānandamata, Is'vara is defined as a Jiva of very high order, always engaged in the meditation of the Paramātmā; and possessing all divine qualities. Such Is'varas are usually considered as seven in number, namely, Brahmā, Viṣṇu, S'iva, Surya, Ganes'a, S'akti and Bhairava. The consort of the Is'v vara, his weapons, vehicle or ornaments, etc. are similar to the Is'vara himself. The abodes of the Is'varas are separate for each. The Is'vara's body is eternal, and his ornaments, weapons, etc. are infinite. The bodies of those, who live in the abodes (or Lokas) of the Is'varas, including the Lokas themselves are perishable. When a devotee by constant worship of Is'vara after his Dikṣā or initiation, reaches him or his Loka, he is said to have become liberated or emancipated. By the term Para-mukti is meant that state or condition attained by the Is'varas them-selves after they reach the Paramānanda Loka along with their devotees.

 The following qualifications are specially required in a person for attaining Mukti. The qualifications are abstention from injury, truthspeaking, avoidance of theft, purity (of mind) or, celibacy, non-acceptance of gifts, penance, contentment, study of the Vedas, devotion to the Is'vara, control of senses, faith in Vedas or S'āstras, simplicity in thought and action, chastity, silence, muttering of Mantras, peace of mind and the study of one's own Matas'āstra or books on religion.

 Paramātmā is the embodiment of eternal bliss, eternal life and illimitable knowledge. His body is exquisitely fine, he is omniscient, and is the Is'vara of Is'varas. His divinity is supreme and is beyond imagination. His powers pervade all places and are felt everywhere like Akās'a or ether. Paramātmā is worshipped even by the Is'varas, who are themselves endowed with powers to confer all desired objects to their devotees. The Paramātman can punish or bless even the Is'varas, is free from pain or pleasure due to Karma (action) and the fruits thereof. He possesses the powers belonging to the act of creation, preservation and destruction; and



also the power of bestowing enlightenment or the highest knowledge. He is the giver of all kinds of knowledge, of Jivan-mukti and even Para-mukti. In short, the Paramātman is described here as possessing both kinds of attributes Saguna as also Nirguna. His abode is known as Paramānanda Loka. In order that one can have an idea of His Bliss it is described in the book after the manner of the Ānandavalli of the Taittiriyopanisad. All that live in the Părānanda Loka are imperishable though they possess the human body and all are gifted with the same Ānanda. There are no trees or birds in that Loka, the water, the wind and the light there have neither a beginning nor an end. All the beings there are composed of males only years of and they all appear to be of six age.

 Is'vara is, in all respects, inferior to Paramātman. The word of the latter is known as Veda, while the words of an Is'vara are known as Tantra. Though the Is'varas are more less similar to Paramātman in respect of omniscience, lordship over all beings, possession of all divine powers, they are inferior to Paramātman in every respect; as they are worshipped only by the Jivas, and because the latter only can be blessed or punished by them. Just as the descriptions of the seven Is'varas vary, so also their duties and abodes are distinct from one another. Brahma's duty is that of creation, Visņu's preservation, S'iva's destruction, Ganapati's prevention of obstacles, S'akti's is the bestowal of knowledge and Surya's is the bestowal of enlightenment. Brahma's abode is called Satyaloka, Visnu's is Vaikuntha, S'iva's is Sʼvetaloka, Vakratunḍa's (or Ganapati's) is Ānandabhuvana, Devi's is known as Mahāpura, while Surya's abode is known as Mahamandala. The above is the description of Is'varas in the present work.

 The Jiva is defined as imperishable, without beginning or end, atomic, full of knowledge, and as the doer of actions and the enjoyer of fruits thereof. He enjoys the objects of the senses with the help of his mind.

 Mokṣa is considered as no-rebirth or freedom from birth; the Jiva gets this condition only when he becomes stationary in the Pārānanda Loka, which he reaches along with the Is'vara whom he was worshipping. This state of the Jiva is known as Kaivalya-mukti.

 The above is the summary of the philosophy, as taught in our book We shall now say a few words about the system of Dikṣā as propounded in it. Just as the Yajamāna, prior to the performance of Vedic sacrifices, has first to follow some fixed rules regarding his food, etc. in the same way is the Tantrik Upāsaka obliged to observe the following rules for a period of twenty-four days before receiving the Dīkṣā. In case this is impossible for such a long period, he should observe them for twelve, six, two or at least for one day, before the day of initiation. The same rules should be observed by him even during the days of the Dīkṣā. The rules consist in the observance of silence, fasting, maintaining oneself on fruits, observance of celibacy, non-removal of hairs from any part of the body, abstention from bowing to or blessing others. The neophyte should anoint himself with sandal paste and adorn himself with clothes, ornaments and flowers of the



colours as are harmonious to the deity whose Mantra he wishes to take. He should wear on his face, fore-head, the right and the left arm and the chest the signs or the weapon-marks belonging to the deity.

 After remaining like this till the last day of the Dikṣā, he should on the next day in the early morning approach his Guru and receive the Mantra, and should thenceforth try to observe the rules laid down in the S'āstras, as also those taught by the religion of the sect to which he belongs after understanding the significance of the same.

 When, in spite of his observing the above rules, the neophyte fails to get the desired result according to the principles of Dakṣa-mārga or the right path, he is allowed to take the Vāmadīkṣā or the initiation into the left path from the proper Guru. The latter should be selected on a very careful and mature consideration, after he is convinced of his wonderful abilities and supernatural attainments. And even after being initiated into the Vāmadīkṣā, the neophyte should in the initial stages manage to proceed with his practices strictly with the help of the substitutes (suggested in the place of flesh, liquor, etc.) He should take special care not to cause even the slightest injury to his powers of self-control and mental concentration. The Upāsaka is similarly [cautioned](# "Vide pp.13 sūtra4;15-46,48,50;19-31,32.")

even when he happens to be the follower of the Uttara-marga. It is also [stated](# "p.39,sūtras 33 & 34.")

that the majority among the deities are easily propitiated through the Dakṣina path alone. The significance of the term Dhyāna-yoga according to this work is the same as given by Patanjali in his Yoga-sutra. Patanjali points out four paths as the means of salvation. They are known as: Karmayoga, Jñānayoga, Bhakti-yoga and Dhyana-yoga. The Brahmacāri or the student attains Siddhi through the Jñāna-yoga, the Grhastha or the householder attains it through the Karma-yoga, the Vanaprastha through the Bhaktiyoga and the Sannyasi through the Dhyana-yoga. In spite of the above fact, Bhakti-yoga occupies the foremost rank and is [considered](# "p.9,sūtras13,14; p.10,sūtras 15,16 & 18.")

the best among them.

 The Pārānanda Sūtra is divided into two Adhyāyas; and each Adhyāya is divided into seven Ahnikas; and the total number of Sutras in the book is 1585. The Sutras of the second Adhyāya resemble the S'rautasūtras in style; even the language in some places more or less corresponds to that found in the latter. Some of the Prayogas contained in the ritual portions of this work are just like those detailed in the Taittiriya Samhita with the difference that while the Mantras used in the Vedic sacrifices are purely Vedic, those recommended in the book are Tantrik in character. But the author of the work seems to have kept in view two main purposes for the book to fulfil: one to bring into the orthodox fold those that were heterodox in his times; and the other to slowly



dissuade those habituated to frequent slaughter of animals in Vedic sacrifices from doing so and to gradually bring them into the Yoga-mārga or the path of Yoga.

 In the above manner are described briefly the duties of people belonging to the different castes and Āsramas; and their nature is such as could be easily practised by the society of that age with respect to the four kinds of Yoga mentioned above. The duties of the king are similarly described with the view to bring together more closely the ties that existed then between the ruler and the ruled, taking care at the same time that every unit or every class did its own duty without meddling with the other to ensure the happiness of the whole. The philosophy contained in the book is also taught in a straight and simple manner, and can be readily understood without a feeling of doubt, comprehended and practised even by the ordinary masses. A peculiar characteristic of the work is that it I carefully avoids all contested philosophical points in its treatment of the subject considering it improper to teach a Dars'ana like the Advaita philosophy which though containing the highest knowledge would be difficult to be understood and still more difficult and impossible to be practised.

 In conclusion, it is but proper that we should offer our heart-felt and sincere thanks to all officers connected with the publication of the Gæk wad's Oriental Series for bringing to light a rare work like the Pārānanda Sūtra, and it is hoped that the public would also benefit themselves immensely by this publication, which embodies in itself the principles and doctrines of a new religious sect hitherto quite unknown.
