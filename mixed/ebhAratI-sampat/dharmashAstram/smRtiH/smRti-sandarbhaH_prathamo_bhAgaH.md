**REMINISCENCES**

 We feel much pleasure in placing before our Dharma Shastra reading public this ery indispensable work named "Smriti sandarbha prepared with a view to bunging all the available Smrities within the orbit of one single collection for proper references Concerning all the topics of human conduct and behaviour in day to day life of the people in the world.

 The Smrities form the guiding factor for determining the path of duties and rights to be performed and enjoyed by man If a man practically follows the principles (सिद्धान्त) mentioned therein he is sure to achieve the highest goal of realizing the Almighty in himself.

 It is an admitted fact that Shabda Brahman is the root cause of the creation विवर्ततेऽर्थभावेन प्रक्रिया जगतो यत (भर्तृहरिकृतवाक्यपदीय



ब्रह्मकाण्ड १ कारिका). And the Vedas are Apaurusheya not human creation but of Divine revelntion as they come direct from the breaths of Brahman "तस्य महतो निःश्वसितमेतत्". The same divine revelation— the knowledge was bestowed upon the Rishies who after deep meditation preached before the humaṅ beings for their welfare. They are, therefore, called the Rishies (spiritual researchers or Sekeers after truth), who were the first receipients of the divine knowledge as revealed to them. " ऋषिदर्शनात्" The word "Shruti" verifies the above contention in the fullest sense of the word. Next to "Shruti" comes the "Smrities" whith form the interpretation of the sacred vedic laws as observed by the Rishies and as such they constitute the law of nature for governing the universe. In a word, "Shruti" means that knowledge which the sages obtained direct from Divine and "Smrities" are their interpretations composed mainly after deep meditation.



 Though men of authority assign the word Hindu law to the Smrities it is in itself a word carrying incomplete significance. This term is of recent origin restricted to denote the body of law which is administered by the law courts since the British period in India. Even this does not cover the whole field of human conduct and jurisprudence.

 The Smrities propound such codes of conduct in theory of Divine origin as are useful and serviceable at all times for all irrespective of caste, creed and colour. Hence the principles laid down are unchangeable by human authority as they are fundmental truths of the universal law. If we ask an Indian where his law is to be found, he will reply that in the Shastras. So the Shastras, broadly speaking, are the books of superhuman knowledge divinely inspired and preached by the sages whocould see the present, past and future the through their



spiritual eyes and they enable every human being to dorive as much benifit from them as he can by his constant practice.

 The whole body ofsacred tradition or what is remembered by human teachers (in contra–distinction to Shruties or what is revealed to the Rishies) is worthy of admiration and application. In its widest acceptation, this use of the term Smrities includes the six Vedangas, the Sutrasboth Shrout andGrihya, the law books of Manu Yajnavalkya etc., the Itihasas, the Puranas and the Niti Shastras; Iti Smríteha; according to such and such traditional precept or legal text. But here we only limit the term to the works of the law-givers. Though we havemore than fifty and odd Smrities, the main body of the codes of law as handed down by tradition consists of Eighteen inspired Law Givers. These are.

मन्यविविष्णुशरीतयाज्ञवल्क्योशनोऽङ्गिराः।  
यमापस्तम्बसम्बर्त्ताः कात्यायनबृहस्पती॥



पराशरव्यास शङ्खलिखिताः वृक्षगौतमौ।  
शाततपो वशिष्ठश्चधर्मशास्त्रप्रयोजकाः॥

(याज्ञवल्क्यस्मृति आचाराध्याय ४।५)

 Manu, Atri, Vishnu, Harita, Yajnavalkya, Ushanas or Shukra, Angiras, Yama, Apastamba, Samvarta, Katyayana, Brihaspati, Parashar, Vyas, Shankha, Likhita, Daksha and Gautama, all these Law Givers are held to be inspired and to have based their precepts on the Vedas. Hence our attempt for the inclusion of these important major and minor Smrities forming a manual or compendium of Good moral conduct for सृष्टि .

 The Smritis as they are, should be read with a view to getting the real significance underlying the words of the Rishies concerned in as much as they are the rules and regulations prescribed for moral conduct of humanity and universe (सृष्टि). In a word, they are the natural Laws of the universe. Therefore, the attempt of bringing out the original texts of the noble codes for placing before the



public is made. Smrities as envisaged by the sages forming the unbiassed and unprejudiced principles have been guiding us since times immemorial. Those have been capably interpreted by the commentators. These great scholars contributed much towards guiding the human destiny and effecting smooth working of society but the inclusion of their commentaries side by the side with the texts, would havecost much labour and the work would have been voluminous out of our control. It is the aim of these law givers that the greatest good to all the creation causing the least harm to any must be realizedthoroughly. It is for the betterment of the universe "विश्व कल्याणार्थ"that these Smrities while forming the background for a smooth working of society shall ever remain the light house for showing real path amidst great stress and storm to the suffering humanity. The sages, law givers as they are, preached these sermons with a sole motive of making



and formulating such a social order upon which depends the smooth working of the corporate life of all and sundry. This way lies the entire solution of all the pretty strifes and trifles which have been caused by different iams as these (principles of Smrities) are in quite harmony with natural law and consistent with the ohanging natural environments for the good of all the creation.

 In a nutshell, these are the surest romedics for all the human maladies caused by constant clashes in human ideologies and by not giving effect to the observation of the laws of nature; the neglectful attitude of which has given rise to so many clashes, inadequacies and inequities among us.

 We shall humbly request the readors to have a watchful eye towards grasping the true meaning of the words of all these anges strictly in accordance with reference to the context to condition, place and time, as for example; the sages have predicted to have a



recourse to agriculture and resort to land work with all renewed energy for the welfare of the state. It is the first and foremost duty of every citizen to translate these precepts in to action as sincerely as anything. It is necessary for ensuring the prosperity of the nation as it is the priority number one for the growth and well being of the human beings. It is the principal item for maintaining the three bare necessities of life *e. g.* food, cloth, and shelter. It is tho greatest of all the Yajnas as a result of which "Anna" foodgrain is available which is life and light of all the living creation. The all-round progress of a country depends mainly upon the abundance of rich harvest. This is necessary pre-requisite for maintaining the vitality of a nation in peace or in war. It is a great Purushartha the successful achievement of which brings good and lasting fruits to bo enjoyed by all in the form of genuine progress. in Art, Science and Literature. The Vedas



enjoin "बलमुपास्व" develop strength which is solely dependant upon upon the bountifulharvest. If a well-to-do young man sits idle and remains homesick all through his blooming age, he is the worst bane to the society. A young is the greatest asset to the nation and as such he must strive hard to grow more and become a productive citizen to his nation in the real sense of the word. But this practice of doing land work and bringing the soil under the plough is not permissible in the old age. A grey-haired sanyasin is better fitted for leading a hermit's life rather than working strenously on land with no results of important yield. He is, moreover, expected to attain perfection and freedom from. transmigration of soul in his last days for better after life. It is old age which is the worst hindrance to hard labour when physical vitality is no more and gives way to mental and spiritual development for obtaining higher planes *e. g.* devotion and



prayer. In our humble opinion if this Yajna, as the Smrities dictate, is performed in all earnestness, the cattle protection and: "grow more food" compaign will no more be slogans of the Government but the Nation as a whole will rise to the occasion to solve the long-felt want of food, as a result abundant yield of food grains and proper protection to cattle will be targetted and achieved.

 A small child up to three entirely lives upon its mother's milk, a wholesome, good and easily digestible diet with other eatable sereals fit for the digestive system of the same as and when necessary. It is also consistent with the nature of the child and plays an important role in forming its vitality, while for the rest of the life and specially in his or her young age the food obtained from land work will constitute the wholesome nutritional diet and help ensure vitality for proper development of physical, mental and spiritual faculties of the individual concorned.



 There is a reference in the Shastric injunctions to the sight at the woman other than one's own wife (धर्मपत्नी) which is solely responsible for the entire downfall and degeneration of tho man, morally and ethically; while on othor occasions, reference to their Darshan ensures peace, progress and prosperity of the person concerned. If we ponder over the idea underlying these words we come to know that it is as a result due to two extreme view-points.

 On one hand, if one looks at the woman other than one's own wife with a passion of ill—will it will cause the worst effect which will allow the dismissal of manly vitality "thevirya" from its place effecting all sorts of diseases thereby. If a drop of "Virya" is wasted it is just like death. It is a common experience that a man entertaining sexual pleasure at his best is the early traveller to the abode of death "यमलोकातिपि". It is true " मरणं विन्दुपातेन जीवनं विन्दुधारणात्।" In a word, a



person wasting bis vitality by excessive sensual gratification is nearer to death than enjoying the pleasures and boons of life bestowed upou him as the best inheritor of nature. On the other, the noble feelings ofreverence and best regards to-wards womanfolk as the manifestation and embodiment of Durga, motherhood by asking and invoking their blessings and seeking for their noble advice ensure good life and total abolition of all the ills due to the person concerned.

 So to say, all the teachings preached by the sages are worthy of our respect and obedience. Still, we must be careful enough to grasp the context as to the place, the time and the condition regarding the text as it occurs and then Rot

accordingly. Indian tradition in moral, ethical and metaphysical spheres deals mainly with Self-restraint, Trath, Love, Non-injury, Non-violence and sympathy. In order to achieve the fourParusharthas and ultimate realization of



God one must perform all injunctions laid down in the Smrities strictly which is the best and surest panacea for all the worldly maladies.

 This collection "Smriti Sandarbha"consists of all the main Smrities available to us at present and attempts are in progress to get more to be included in future. This voluminous publication undertaken will be completed in more than a couple of volumes. This present one includes ten Smrities in all. It is nineth publication in the "Gurumandaiseries". We owe a great debt of gratitude to Rajguru Dharmadhurin Pandit Haridatta Shastri Vidyalankar, Vidyabhushan, Vidyaratna of Tehri Garhwal whose scholarly paternal guidancehas always inspired us to bring this and other publications of the series in the hands of the honourable readers.

 For Shri Mansukhrai More we have no words to express our gratitude. It is by



mistakes and omissions occurring in this publication which is a natural outcome of suoha task of great magnitude which we hope, they will not leave uncorrected as per errata given in the end.

sheer dint of his noble aptitudes of head and heart, experience, knowledge, strong will and keen love for the Shastras that the work was undertaken at his own instance and initiative and has been a success to the last. Farther more, it has been the aim of his life to present the noble principles envisaged in the Vedas which are acclaimed as of lasting service and profit to all the creatures. He has been, so to say, striving hard to bring the treasure house of the noble heritage of humanity for the benefit of all.

 Shri Moreji is ever as enthusiastic as he has been philanthropic contributing much towards getting the publication financed and printed to be presented to the public for the best use conceivable. It is also gratifying to note that Seth Mansukhrai More has been genuinely devoting his precious life for the last decade or so substantially doing for the "Betterment of the suffering humanity all the



world over by giving wide publicity to the selfaxiomed precepts envisaged in the Shruties and Smrities through very comprehensible and indispensable interpretation well appropriate to the contexts. His book Grihastha Dharma has been a popular watch word to all the Hindi-speaking house holders. In a word, Shri Moreji has, to his credit, a life entirely devoted to selfless service to his fellow persons in particular and all the creatures of universe in general. Even as he acts and moves his thoughts are concentrated towards performing deeds of kindness never of indiscriminate charity, but of far reaching con-sequences; work of introducing measures to develop agriculture, horticulture and to protect our cattle wealth for national prosperity. He believes in the decentralization programme for the village uplift as propounded by the Father of the Indian Nation "Gandhiji" änd is a true devotee of Ahimsa as preached by the Shastras. His unperturbed zeal towards



"ईशावास्यमिदं ꣳ सर्वम्"is a matter for envy to all. An institution SattvieJiwan Shala at Nawalgarh (Jaipur-Rajasthan) is a successful experiment in giving shape to his noble plans wherestudents are imparted free instruction of all kind in the healthy natural environment and atmosphere of the open. The boys lead a self restraint life, Brahmacharya Jiwan, "far from madding crowd's ignoble strife", where they do spade, work, manual labour and enjoy other extra-curricular activities which help in developing their physical, mental and spiritual progress in a balanced manner to become capable citizens of the country. All this is reminiscent of ancient Ashram life. His is a dream for carrying out this successful experiment on a grand scale on all world basis.

 We wish Shree Moreji all success and may God bless him with more resources at his disposal for performing all the humanitarian tasks which he hopes to undertake in near



future so that long cherished feelings of compassion and mutual understanding may prevail among all the nationals bringing in their wake the real progress and prosperity of

the world.

असतो मा सद् गमय  
तमसोमा ज्योतिर्गमय  
मृत्योर्मा अमृतं गमय

 Lead us from Unreal to Real, from Darkness to Light and from Death to Immortality. May God bless us for performing deeds as, directed by Shruties and Smrities so that all our concerted efforts may bring heaven on this earth a fit abode for gentle, humble and faithful world citizens.

 In the end, while thanking all of our gentle co-workers and kind sympathisers in this noble cause, we begatapology of our honoured readers for all the trecuracies.

SHASTRI BRAHMA DATTA  
LADURAM TRIVEDI,



हुईं उसी मन्त्रद्रष्टाकी ऋषि संज्ञा हुई। ऋषियों द्वारा अनन्ताकाश में आवत्तं-तरंग रूप से लहराते हुए परमेश्वर उद्गीथ रूप आदिनाद ऋषियों ने तपस्या करते-करते दिव्यश्रुति दिव्य दृष्टि पाकर विश्व मेंप्रसरण किया। मन्त्रों के आवर्त ( वीची तरङ्ग) के स्वरुपका देवताओं के मन्त्र द्वारा ज्ञान हो सकता है। त्रिकोण आदि जितने मन्त्र दीप्तपड़ते हैं वे उन उन मन्त्रों के आवर्तरूप के प्रतीक हैं, इन्हीं आवर्तोसे ऋषियों ने भिन्न भिन्न मन्त्रों का अनुसन्धान प्राप्त किया है। विद्वन्मोदतरङ्गिणी में लिखा है— "मन्त्रात्मकाहि देवाः" अर्थात् ये मन्त्र ही देवतास्वरूप हैं। आदिवैदिकमन्त्रों को श्रुति शब्द से निर्देश किया है। इन्हीं मन्त्रों के संस्मरण से मनु याज्ञवल्क्यादि ऋषियों ने अपने संस्मरणों को प्रकट किया जिनको स्मृतिनाम दिया गया। स्मृति शक्ति का विकास स्मृतिनिर्माता ऋषि मुनियों की जीवनी के अध्ययनसे स्पष्ट हो जायगा। स्मृतिशक्ति का समार उस सदाचार पर निहित है जो याज्ञवल्क्यादि का था।

 वेदव्यासजी ने श्रुतिस्मृति के सिद्धान्तों का विस्तार अष्टादश पुराणों में किया है। इनका अध्ययन धर्म की तात्विकता का प्रवोधक होने से भारतीय संस्कृति ने इनका अध्ययन मानव जाति को अपनी उच्चपरिस्थिति तथा यथार्थ कान्ति का साधन माना है। भगवद्गीता मे—

"कर्मणो ह्यपिबोद्धव्यं बोद्धव्यं च विकर्मणः।  
अकर्मणश्च बोद्धव्यं गहना कर्मणोगतिः॥"

 कर्म की गहन गति कहते हुए कर्म, अकर्म और विकर्म परिपाक परे विचार करने को लिखा हें। यह विज्ञान स्मृति ग्रन्थों से



ही प्राप्य है। स्मृति ग्रन्थ मनुष्य के कर्तव्यं और अकर्तव्य का निर्देशक होने से मनुष्यमात्र को स्मृति शास्त्रों में देश काल भेद से जो कर्तव्य सांस्कृतिक जीवन, व्यवहार नीति और कर्म विपाक दिखाया है उसकी जानकारी होनी परमावश्यक है। विना स्मृति ग्रन्थों के जाने कर्तव्य कर्म, ग्राह्यव्यवहार, और त्यज्यव्यवहार का ज्ञान नहीं हो सकता है। भारतवर्ष में प्रायः लोग अपने को स्मार्तधर्मी कहते हैं अर्थात् स्मृति प्रतिपाद्य जीवन यात्रा बनानाहै। श्रुति का विशदीकरण स्मृतियों में है। कविकुलचूड़ामणि कालिदास ने लिखा भी है—"श्रुतेरिवार्थ स्मृतिरन्यगच्छत्" वेद मन्त्रों का ही विशदीकरण स्मृति शास्त्र हैं। श्रुतिद्रष्टा ऋषि के अनन्तर स्मृतिकार ऋषि "मुनि" कहे जाते हैं। स्मृतियां४०१५० के लगभग हैं। प्रत्येक स्मृति का अधार दर्पधर्मआश्रमधर्म, राजधर्म व व्यवहारकमहैं परन्तु किसी स्मृति में किसीमात को प्रधान मानकर विस्तार से वर्णन किया गया, दूसरी स्मृति ने किसी दूसरे महत्वपूर्ण विषय को प्रधानः वर्णन स्थान दिया हैं। कर्म अकर्म का व्यवहारस्मृति का ही स्मरण है। याज्ञवल्क्यने मानवता के पतन का कारण बताया है—

विहितस्याननुष्ठानात् निन्दितस्य च सेवनात्।  
अनिग्रहाच्चेन्द्रियाणां नरः पतनमृच्छति॥

 जिन कर्मों के करने का विधान किया गया है अर्थात् सांसारिकनित्य, नैमित्तिक ग्राह्यकर्म, व्यावहारिक, नैतिक सांस्कृतिक जिन जिन को कर्तव्य बताया गया है अर्थात् विधि नियम रुप से प्रतिपादित कर्मों का



"मन्वत्रिविष्णुहारीतयाज्ञवल्क्योशनोऽङ्गिराः।  
यमापस्तम्बसम्बर्त्ताः कात्यायनबृहस्पतिः॥

पराशरव्यासशङ्खलिखिताः दक्षगौतमौ।  
शातातपो वशिष्ठश्च धर्मशास्त्रप्रयोजकाः॥"

 स्मृतिग्रन्थ और भी हैं किन्तु धर्मशास्त्रीयव्यवस्था के प्रयोजक मनु से वशिष्ठ तक हैं जिनके नाम उक्त इलोकों में हैं। उक्त धर्मशास्त्रीय स्मृतियों के अनुरुपपरिषद् व्यवस्था देने की अधिकारिणी होती हैं। उक्त धर्मशास्त्रों में प्रायः धर्मनिर्णय की शैली एक हीहै। कुछ गवेषकोका मतहै कि स्मृतियां भिन्न-भिन्न काल में विभिन्न दृष्टिकोण से लिखी गई हैं यह गवेषणा सर्वथा सत्य नहीं है। ऋषि मुनियों के अतिरिक्त कोई प्रगाढ़ पाण्डित्यवादी भी धर्मशास्त्रप्रयोजक (व्यवस्थादेनेवाला) नहीं हो सकता है। काव्य, दर्शन, इतिहास, विज्ञान, रसायन आदि भिन्न-भिन्न काल में भिन्न-भिन्न विद्वानों के उद्गार भिन्न-भिन्न दृष्टिकोण से हैं परन्तु धर्मशास्त्र की मर्यादा एक है। देशकालभेद से जो तारतम्य होता है उसका स्पष्टीकरणवहीं किया गया है। स्मृतिग्रन्थों में सत्य, त्रेता, द्वापर और कलियुग इन चार युगों में तपस्या, ज्ञान, यज्ञ और दान इनको युग के अनुरूप प्राथमिकता दी गई है। इससे यह अर्थ न समझना कि सत्ययुग में दान नहीं था और कलियुग में तप नहीं है। अबयुगों में तप, यज्ञ ज्ञान और दान की महिमा है केवल किस युग में किस धर्म की प्रधानता हैयहइसका तात्पर्य है।

 धर्मशास्त्रोमें विधि वाक्य, नियम वाक्य, परिसंख्या और अर्थवाद



वाक्यों की परिभाषा की जानकारी कर तब ठीक ठीक तात्पर्य बुद्धि में आवेग, अन्यथा कहीं विरोधाभास प्रतीन होने से भ्रम हो जायगा। विधि वाक्य और नियम वाक्यों में जो बताया गया है उसका पालन न करने से शास्त्रीय दण्ड या प्रायश्चित का भागी होता है। स्मृति ग्रन्थों का मौलिक रचनाक्रम और धर्मशास्त्रीय व्यवस्था संस्कार परिज्ञान धर्मपूर्वक व्यवहार शासक के गुण प्रायः सब स्मृतियों में समान ही हैं। परन्तु किसी स्मृतिकार ने किसी वात को अधिक महत्त्व दिया है।

 सृष्टिरचनाक्रम वर्णन करके मनु ने आचार संस्कार का वर्णन किया है। उनने जिन आचार व्यवहारों का वर्णन अपनी स्मृति मैं बताया है उसके लिये कहा गया है 'यह सब वेद वाक्यहैं यथा—

'यन्मनुरवदत्तदूभेषजं भेषजानाम्

 मनुस्मृति के द्वितीय अध्याय में आया है—

यः कश्चित्कस्यचिद्धर्मो मनुना सम्प्रकीर्तितः।  
स सर्वो विहितो वेदे सर्वज्ञानमयो हि सः॥

 मनुस्मृति में धर्म बताया गया है वह सब वेदों में हैं। यहां यह ध्यान रखने की धापहे कि महर्षि मनु के ये विचार हैं जिन्हें महर्षिभृगुजी ने निवन्धीकृत किया है। मनु को सम्पूर्ण ज्ञाननिष्ठा थी। मनु ने गर्भाधानसंस्कार से विवाह संस्कार तक को धर्म बताया है। तृतीय अध्याय में कहा गया है—



न हो तवतक हमसव समान हैं यह कल्पता, तो बन्ध्यापुत्रवत् हैं। मनु ने स्मृति की समाप्ति में कहा भी है—

धर्मस्य परमं गुह्यं ममेदं सर्वमुक्तवान्।  
सर्वमात्मनि सम्पश्येत्सच्चासच्चसमाहितः॥

 धर्मशास्त्रका परम सिद्धान्तयही है कि सब प्राणिमात्र में अपने को समझे याज्ञवल्क्यने भी यही कहा है—

"अतो यदात्मनोऽपश्यं परेषां न तदाचरेत्।"

 जो बात तुमको दुःखदायी हो वह बात कभी दूसरे जीव को मतकरो यही धर्म मनुष्य का है।

 याज्ञवल्क्यने संस्कार विधि दाय विभाग और पुत्रोत्पत्ति को भी धर्मशास्त्रीय व्यवस्था से बांधा था—

धर्मोऽयं रवि संज्ञकः  
आपद्यपद्यपुत्रापि दायधर्मान्निबोधत।

 पुत्रोत्पत्ति और दाय विभाग को भी धर्म बताया है और कहा है कि इसमें किसी प्रकार दस्तक्षेप करना धर्ममर्यादा पर हस्तक्षेप माना जायगा। राजधर्म में शासक की योग्यता के सम्बन्ध में—

महोत्साह, स्थूललक्ष्यः कृतज्ञोवृद्धसेवकः।  
विनीतः सत्त्वसम्पन्नः कुलीनः सत्यवाक्शुचिः॥  
अदीर्घसूत्रः स्मृतिमान् अक्षुभोऽपरुषस्तथा॥

 शासक के स्मृतिमान् स्मृतिशास्त्रोंका ज्ञाता,कृतज्ञ,कुलीन, सत्वप्रधान आदि लक्षण बनाये हैं। व्यवहार में ऋणादान अर्थात् रूपया



की बृद्धि के दर से लेकर सब प्रकार के भूमि कर आदि की सुचारु व्यवस्था की है।

 मर्यादात्यागी (धर्मशास्त्र की विधि नियम का उल्लङ्घनकरनेवाले) को प्रायश्चितोबताया है। पाप पांच श्रेणियों में बनाये हैं— महापाप, अतिपाप, उपपातक, पातक, जातिभ्रंश आदि। मद्यपान महापाप बताया है, कृतघ्नपुरुषप्रायश्चित करने पर भी शुद्ध नहीं होता है इत्यादि। अग्निस्मृति में शुद्धता को विशेष स्थान दिया है। विष्णुस्मृति में भगवदुपासना-भक्ति का सङ्केत सर्व प्रकार की बाधा निवृत्तिके लिये बताया है। इसके अतिरिक्त मानव संस्कृति को विष्णुस्मृतिने एक बहुत सुचारुऔर आवतक प्रणाली में बर्णनकिया है। इस शिक्षाबली के अध्ययन और विचार से मानवता कीसंस्कृति का विकास हो जाता है। इन सूत्रों में धार्मिक आचरण और पारस्परिक सम्बन्ध यमनियम उपासना उत्सवादियों का सविस्तर वर्णन है। शाततप ने प्रायश्चितकरने का विशेष स्थान कहा है—

प्रायश्चित्तविहीतानां महापातकिनां नृणाम्।  
नरकान्ते भवेज्जन्म चिह्नाङ्कितशरीरिणाम्॥



 शातातप ने किस पाप के करने से क्या रोग होता है उसका विशेष वर्णन किया है। रोगोत्पत्ति के विषय में यह बताया कि अलग अलग रोग अलगअलग पापों से होते हैं। साथ ही उन पापों से निवृत्ति होने का उपाय भी बताया है जिससे रोग शान्त हो जाय।

 शंख ने संस्कारों की आवश्यकता पञ्च महायज्ञ आदि धार्मिक गृहस्थजीवन का विस्तार किया तथा वानप्रस्थ वसन्यासकी विधि वतलाई।

 लिखित ने इष्टापूर्त का माहात्म्य बताया हैं—

"इष्टेन लभते स्वर्गं पुर्त्तेनमोक्षमाप्नुयात्"

 यज्ञ, धर्मशाला, वापी, कूप तडागको धर्म की प्रधानता कही है।

'कलौ पाराशरी स्मृता'

 इस युग मैंपराशर की स्मृति का स्थान बताया। पराशरजी ने बहिकाश्रमतपोभूमि में शौनकादि ऋषियों के साथ आये हुए व्यासजी को कलियुग के धर्म में अत्यन्त जागरुकता बनाई। कलियुग में वर्णाश्रम धर्म की मर्यादा से भ्रष्ट होने पर तत्काल पतन होना बताया है और दान की प्रधानतः कलियुग की धर्मनिष्ठा बताई है। कलियुग में कृषि कर्म को प्रधान धर्म बनाया है।कृषि कर्म के साथ गौ का निखार्य पालन धर्म और अलिप्रर्द वछडेका पालन-पोषण तया दान का बड़ा माहात्म्य बताया है। द्विजमात्रको कृषिकर्म करने का आदेश दिया है—

"कृतेरन्यतमोधर्मां न लभेत्कृषितोऽन्यथा।  
न सुखं कृषितोऽन्यत्र यदि धर्मेण कर्षति॥"



 खेती के समान और कोई धर्म नहीं है यदि स्मृतियों में बताये नियम धर्म से खेती चलावे तो कृषि महान् यज्ञ है जिसके द्वारा कीट पतङ्गपशु पक्षी सभी की परितृप्ति होती है।कृषि यज्ञ में यज्ञशिष्टाशीः बह ही पुण्यहोंगें जो कीट पतङ्गादि सेलेकर ऋृषि मुनि तपस्वीसबके लिये अन्न का भाग निकाल कर फिर अवशिष्ट को अपने गृहस्थ के काम में ले। धर्मपूर्वक खेती का यही रहस्य है। श्रीमद्भगवद्गीता में— 'यज्ञशिष्टाशिनः सन्तो मुच्यन्ते सर्वकिल्बिषैः' कहकर कितना बड़ा महत्व बताया गया है। इसीलिये महर्षियों कीउञ्छवृत्तिका विधान भी चरितार्थ होता है। मयि कणाद इसके ज्वलन्त प्रमाण हैं।

 इसीलिये बो कहाहै—

"षट्कर्माणि कृषिंये तु कुर्युर्ज्ञानविधिं द्विजाः।  
ते सुरादिपरप्राप्ताः स्वर्गलोकमवाप्नुयुः॥

 द्विज मात्र को खेती करने का विधान पराशरजी बनाते हैं। उपनिषद् में भी आया है "अक्षेैर्मा दीव्य कृषिमित्कृषस्य" (ऋृ.७।८।५) इन्द्रियों के भोगों में मत खेलो, कृषि कर्म में मन लगाओ इस तरह मनुष्यमात्र को क्षेती करना धर्म बतायाहै। तव तोस्थान-स्थान पर वछडेका पालन करने का विधान और उसे
हृष्टपुष्टबनाकरदान देने का विधानहै—

एकोऽपि वृषभो देयो धुर्धरः शुभलक्षणः।  
अरोगश्चापरिक्लिष्टोयस्मात्सदशगोसमः॥



एकेन दत्तेन वृषेण येन  
दत्ताभवेयुर्दश सौरभेयाः।  
आहेम पीताद्धरणीसमाना  
त्तस्माद्वृषात्पूज्यतमोऽस्तिनान्यः॥

 एक पुष्ट वृषभ का दान दस गोदान के तुल्य बनाया है। दान ब्राह्मण लेते हैं इसलिये कृषिकमे द्विजाति मात्र काधर्म महर्षिपराशरबतलाते हैं। इसी प्रकार अत्रि-संहिता में खेती का वर्णन आया है। हारीत ने भी कृषि कर्म को धर्म बताया है।देवपितृपूजन को सविस्तर वर्णन मिलता है। स्मृतियों में वैदिक शब्दों के उद्धरण होने से इनका अभिप्राय निरुक्त और निघण्टु के अनुकूल प्रसङ्गानुसार आवश्यक है यतः स्मृतियां वेदानुरूप ही हैं।

 कात्यायन ने राजधर्म, आश्रमधर्म दानधर्म और मर्यादा पालन पर विशेषतया कहा है।

 वृहस्पति ने सामप्रधान राजनीति और दानधर्म बनाया है।

 ओशनस ने राजशासन में दण्डदापन को धर्म कहा है।

 नारद स्मृति में—

"धर्मेकतानाः पुरुषास्तदासन् सत्यवादिनः।  
नष्टे धर्मे मनुष्येषु व्यवहारः प्रवर्त्तितः॥"

 जवतक मनुष्य जाति की स्वाभाविक गति धर्मानुकूल चलती जाती थी तवतक व्यवहार का अनुशासन नहीं था। धर्म गति से जब संसार विचलित होने लगा तवव्यवहार के नियमों में उसे जकड़ना पड़ा। नारदीय

 एक पुष्ट वृषभ का दान दस गोदान के तुल्य बताया है। दान ब्राह्मण लेते हैं इसलिये कृषिकर्म द्विजाति मात्र काधर्म महर्षिपराशर वतलाते हैं। इसी प्रकार अत्रि-संहिता में खेती कावर्णन आया है। हारीत ने भी कृषि कर्म को धर्म बताया है। देवपितृपूजन को सविस्तर वर्णन मिलता है। स्मृतियों में वैदिक शब्दों के उद्धरण होने से इनका अभिप्राय निरुक्त और निघण्टु के अनुकूल प्रसङ्गानुसार आवश्यक है स्मृतियां वेदानुरूप ही हैं।

 कात्यायन ने राजधर्म, आश्रमधर्म दानधर्म और मर्यादा पालन विशेषतया कहा है।

 वृहस्पति ने सामप्रधान राजनीति और दान धर्म बताया है।

 औशनस ने राज्यशासन में दण्डदान को धर्म कहा है।

 नारद स्मृति में—

"धर्मेकतानाः पुरुषास्तदासन् सत्यवादिनः।  
नष्टे धर्मे मनुष्येषु व्यवहारः प्रवर्त्तितः॥"

 जबतक मनुष्य जाति की स्वाभाविक गति धर्मानुकूल चलती नवतक व्यवहार का अनुशासन नहीं था। धर्म गति से जब विचलितहोने लगातवव्यवहार के नियमों में उसे जकड़ना पडा।



पार्थ शक्यनहीं । शक्ति न रहने परपुरुषायें करने से उलटी हानि हीहोतीहै।

 वालक के लिये अपनी माता का दूध ही पथ्य, हितकर और प्रकृति के अनुकूल है जो उसकी शक्ति है और बड़े होने पर तोपृथ्वी माता से उत्पन्न किया हुआ अन्न ही उसकी शक्ति है।

 शास्त्रों में बताया गया है कि पराई स्त्री कोदेखना अत्यन्त नाशकारक है और कहीं उनके दर्शन से उन्नति सुख प्राप्ति होती है। इसमें बुरी भावना से स्त्री को देखना विनाशकारक है। दुर्भावना बुरे भाव से स्त्रीको देखने से मन की अस्वस्थता होकर मनुष्य का वीर्य चलायमान हो जाता है जिसमे आयु क्षीण होती है क्योंकि शरीर में बिन्दु (वीर्य) ही राजा है। कामी पुरुषकी आयु का नाश होता है। परन्तु माताओं और बहनों के प्रति ऊंचे भाव मातृभावआशीर्वाद और शिक्षा के हेतु दर्शन करने से पुण्यप्राप्ति एव पापों का नाश होता है लिखा भी है— "मरणं बिन्दुपातेन जीवनं बिन्दुधारणात्।"

 महर्षियों के सभी शब्द मान्य एवं शिरोधार्य है केवल देश, काल और अवस्थाका ध्यान रहे महषियों काके वचनों में प्रविष्ट होना चाहिये।

 मानव जागृति में स्मृतियों के ज्ञानपरिशीलन ज्ञान परमावश्यक है। स्मृतियों के ज्ञान के बिना व्यवहार राजधर्म एवं संस्कृतिक जीवनी में दोषआजाता है।



 यह गुहनरकार्य कई राण्ढोंमें सम्पादित दोगा जिन्हें शीघ्र ही प्रकाश में लाने के लिये श्रीमान् मोरजी सोत्साह उत्सुक हैं। सेठजी ऐसे अत्युतम ग्रन्थ के लोक हितकारी प्रकाशन के लिये आशीर्वाद और धन्यवाद के पान है जिनकी व्यावहारिक जीवनी भी शाखों के विनोद तथा प्रसारण से देश जाति की यथार्थ सेवा कर रही है। सेठजी शास्त्रोक्त मार्ग से उपासना और जनसेवा कृषि कर्म विकास गोधन की रक्षा के निरन्तर प्रयत्नमें लगे रहते हैं। भगवान् उदारमनाः सेठजी के सत्-सङ्कल्पसफल कर जनता में धार्मिक भावना एवं परस्पर एकता प्रदान करें।
