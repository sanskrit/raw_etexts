**PREFACE**

* Tīrthavivecana-kāṇḍa* is the eighth part of Lakṣmīdhara's great digest, and it is the second section of it to be published. The publication of later divisions of a *nibandha* before the earlier requires a word of explanation. Through the action of many causes, which can only be now surmised, the *KṛtyaKalpataru* has all but disappeared, and nowhere has a complete copy of it come to light. Libraries are fortunate which possess a part or two even in a transcript not over two centuries old. It has been the aim, in publishing it, to use all manuscripts of any section that may be discovered after assiduous search. Obvious difficulties exist in basing a book on a solitary manuscript, even if its text is tolerably correct. In the case of the *KṛtyaKalpataru*, however, an *andha-paramparā*of scribes, who transcribed from predecessors not better equipped, has resulted in texts which are far from satisfactory. In the case of some divisions valuable help in the preparation of a tolerable text comes from an unexpected quarter. The great *nibandha* of Lakṣmīdhara was held in such respect by later writers that they made extensive use of it, some going to the length of transferring to the pages of their own books, not only passages of the earlier *nibandha*, but whole chapters, comprising quotations, reproduced in the same order as in the original, and comments and verbal interpretations. It may be said with justice that some of the later digests are but built on a central core supplied by Lakṣmīdhara with overlayers made up of further quotations from sources which he had rejected. This is so for instance with Caṇḍeśvara's *Gṛhastharatnākara* in relation to *Gṛhastha-kāṇḍa* of the *Kṛtya-Kalpataru*, the *Dāna-khaṇḍa* of Hemādri's *Caturvarga-cintāmaṇi* and the *DānaKalpataru*, and Mitramiśra's *Tīrthaprakāśa* and the section on *Tīrtha* in the *Kṛtya-Kalpataru* now published. But for this help, and the accident of the discovery of a manuscript of the *Tīrtha-kāṇḍa* during a special visit that I made to the Library of the Bhonsle Mahārājas at Nagpur, and the acquisition of another manuscript of it for the Library of the Punjab University by Paṇḍit R. A. Śāstri (who brought the fact to my



notice) its present publication might have been delayed. Two manuscripts of it known to exist in Mithila were not available, in spite of attempts to get them.

 The *Tīrtha* section of the *Kalpataru* has some special claims to attention. It is apparently the first re-statement of the theory of *Tīrtha-yātrā* (pilgrimage), which had been dealt with unsystematically in epic and Purāṇic literature and was hardly noticed in the law books. Its inclusion in a *Dharma-śāstra-nibandha* was an explicit assertion of the place of pilgrimage in the recognized scheme of Hindu life. By what it omitted, as much as by what it described, *Tīrtha–Kalpataru* gave an authoritative decision on every matter on which practice, supposed to be grounded on *Purāṇic* or Smṛti authority, was justified. Illustrations of this will be found in the Introduction. Later writers on the subject merely expanded some of these points or aspects by scholastic discussions conducted with a parade of learning and logic. The enumeration of so many *Tīrthas*, and especially about three hundred of them within the narrow confines of Benares, whose frontiers are defined by reference to the arc of the Ganges and the bounds of the two streams of the Vāraṇāand the AsĪ, might seem to make Lakṣmīdhara an Indian Pausanias. But, the Greek was animated only by antiquarian feeling, and not by the pious motive to discover a mode of life in this existence, which will help in the struggle that might otherwise last through innumerable incarnations and end at last the unending transit "from the womb to the tomb" and back again to the womb. Unlike the pilgrim-guides and Bædekers or Murrays produced nowadays, with administrative encouragement, for the manifest economic advantage that a country might gain from a developed tourist traffic, Hindu works on *Tīrtha* dwelt even more upon the "inner" preparation for the pilgrimage than upon its externals. A proper understanding of the evolution of the theory of *Tīrtha* is needed to dissipate the vulgar thaumaturgy, investing the waters of a *Tīrtha* with a power of cleansing more than physical, irrespective of the mental and spiritual attitudes of pilgrims, upon which the professional priests at the great *Tīrthas* and their touts, who waylay pilgrims hundreds of miles away, batten.

 It is this contribution of Lakṣmīdhara and of the treatises modelled on his which it has been the aim of the Introduction



to explain and evaluate. The ascetic way of life on which the fruition of a pilgrimage depends (*tīrtha-phala*) is itself a spiritual preparation, which culminates in the ecstasy of the attainment of the *tīrtha*. The raptures of the pilgrim, who cries "Gangā, Gaṅgā” through his toilsome march to the divine stream, and who humbles himself on his first sight of the river or a *kṣetra* like Kāśī and salutes it, are the marks of this feeling. It will be wrong to treat a work on *Tīrtha*, like Lakṣmīdhara's either as a priestly manual or as a mere pilgrim's itinerary. The apparently dry discussions of ritual and of gradations of benefit springing from pilgrimage have a background of philosophy, which is often missed. It is noteworthy that with the practical statesmanship to be expected of him, Lakṣmīdhara brushes aside some of the more rigorous rules, such as those relating to compulsory tonsure, the use of vehicles, etc. Later writers, who are more scholiasts than statesmen, revel in discussions of the rites he will not stress.

 A consideration of *tīrtha-vivecana* before and after him shows the lines of the evolution of the Hindu theory of pilgrimage, which it has been the attempt of the Introduction to make clear. The connection between fasts, the satisfaction of the manes, the concepts of sin, expiation and purification and the mental and physical cleanliness of the pilgrim have to be clarified. It has been attempted in the Introduction. The function of a modern editor of such a work is to correct the eliptical treatment of the *nibandhas*, which presume on an intimacy with the philosophic and religious back-ground of life, that is now rare. The difference between the ancient Hindu and the modern outlook may be most clearly seen in the attitude to death and suffering. The assumption that the doctrine of *samsāra* and *karma* have their roots in a belief in pre-destination and the denial of human volition have been exposed in modern studies of Indian philosophy. It is because man is the architect of his own fortune, master of his destiny, that pilgrimages are acceptable as means of grace.

 Death has no terrors for those who believe in the Hindu theory of survival of personality and *karma.* When one undertook a long and arduous pilgrimage, he went prepared for death. The attitude struck the imagination of Sir William Hunter, when he described with feeling and eloquence how, when the pilgrim enters the ferry over the river *Vaitaraṇī*,



which divides Bengal from the holy land of Utkala, sanctified by the residence of the Lord of the World (Jagannātha) at His city (Puri), the ferryman whispers into the ears of the pilgrim the *mantra*, which associates the mundane stream with the stream of the other world, after which it is named, and which the disembodied souls have to cross. It is this spirit that makes the pilgrim "scorn delights and live laborious days" in the course of the tour, and continue the mode of life after his return home. It is this again which even to-day views with disapproval well-intentioned attempts, in the interests of public health, to discourage or prohibit festivals or gatherings of pilgrims at great *tīrthas* and *kṣetras*. When a pilgrim is recommended to find release by undertaking the journey from which he will not return (*Mahāprasthāna*) or find a short-cut to release by drowning himself at a confluence of sacred streams, or by falling from a cliff at Amarakaṇṭaka, where is the meaning of trying to save his "life" (and prolong the suffering of endless re-birth) by putting obstacles in the way of his transit?

  The provision of conveniences to pilgrims was therefore a pious duty. The Indian wayside is dotted with stands of stone on which the weary pilgrim may rest his load. It is punctuated with *sairas*, tanks, and wells. The planting of shade-giving trees on the roads was mainly in the interest of pilgrims. Like the palmer in medieval Europe, the Indian pilgrim has been free to move through the length and breadth of the wide conti-nent of India. The lives of Indian saints like Caitanya and Rāmdās Samarth show how they wandered unhindered from shrine to shrine, from *tīrtha* to *tīrtha*. The greatest of South Indian kings, Kulottunga Coḷa, won enduring fame by abolish-ing tolls throughout his dominions. His action captured imagination, and he is remembered as the Coḷa who did away with an obnoxious (and impious) exaction (Śuṅgam tavirttaŚoḻ

aṉ

). While administrative and economic justification of so beneficent a measure may be seen, it is necessary that its value to unhindered pilgrimage which it is the duty of the Hindu king to foster, should not be overlooked. Of all the unpopular measures of Muslim rule, the most obnoxious was the tax on pilgrims. The monk Kavīndrācārya won fame by procuring its suspension by Shahjahan (vide G.O.S., XVII, p. v). Its absence under the East India Company can be reckoned among the attractions of its rule. But for weakening religious senti-



ment, due to weakening faith, its successor, the modern pilgrimtax, on which municipalities in pilgrim centres thrive, would be quite as hateful.

 From the standpoint of the student of history, the study of *Tīrtha* literature has many attractions. The history of holy places like Kāśī, and the discovery of the dates of its shrines and monuments are obviously services to history. We can distinguish between ancient and spurious shrines, and between ancient and late works, claiming equal antiquity and authority. But, the value of the literature is greater in a respect not so obvious. Pilgrimage contributed to the unification of Indian culture by the steady circulation of the moral *elite* in the population of the Indian continent. Kāśīwas the lodestone which drew South Indians to Hindusthan. Śetu near Rāmeśvaram drew pilgrims from the north to the dike that Rāma had built in the epic conflict to vindicate the honor of woman. The occupation of large areas that a pilgrim would have to traverse by rulers of an alien or hostile faith was only an unpleasant incident, which had to be faced by the pilgrim. Where political ambitions united or divided the country, pilgrimage wrought a unity based on religion, and a faith in certain eternal verities. Long before wise statesmanship attempted or accomplished Indian unification, *Akhand Hindusthān* had sprung from the wanderings of pilgrims. It has been so with the Muslims also. The Hāj, born of the genius of the Prophet, has united the Islamic world, not the Caliphate.

 From a social standpoint, pilgrimage is noteworthy for its levelling influence. Sex, color, civil condition, economic inequality, traditions of servitude, which made some classes untouchable, all disappeared in the presence of *tīrtha-yātrā*. It was the means of "salvation for all."

 It has been the aim of the editor to draw attention to some of these features, so that the wisdom of Lakşmīdhara in making it a cardinal section of his survey of Hindu duty may be properly appreciated. *Tīrtha* literature has to be read with an eye on its background.

 It remains to acknowledge my obligations. More than in most of my writings, the labour of editing this book has devolved entirely on me. Dr. B. Bhattacharyya,

M.A

.,

PH.D.,

has helped me as usual with manuscripts which I needed. The



authorities of the Punjab University have to be thanked for the loan of a manuscript. The Hon'ble Mr. B. S. Niyogi, Judge of the Nagpur High Court, helped me to gain access to the library of the Bhonsle Mahārājas from which I borrowed a set of six parts of the *Kṛtya-Kalpataru*, of which Tīrthakāṇḍa was one. I am indebted to Mr. E. S. Maclenaghen then Deputy Commissioner of Nagpur, for procuring me the loan of these manuscripts.

 Mr. A. N. Krishna Aiyangar,

M.A., L.T

., Joint Editor, *Bramavidyā*, Adyar, has as usual shared the drudgery of proof correction. Mr. R. Narayanaswami Aiyar,

B.A., B.L

., Proprietor of the Madras Law Journal Press, at which the book has been printed, has taken a personal interest in the work for which I am grateful, as thereby the difficulties of taking it through in these hard days have been overcome.

 Attention is invited to the appendices, in which the sacred places, rivers, etc., have been classified, and as far as possible identified. In the task of identification my obligation Nandolal Dey's *Geographical Dictionary of* *India* will be evident..

[TABLE]



The eighth book of *Kṛtya-kalpataru* is designated by its author *Tīrtha-vivecana-kāṇḍa*. The great digest (*nibandha*) is the oldest work of the type extant, and one of the earliest of the class. It is also one of the largest as well as the most comprehensive. It aims at being complete and self-contained, viewed as an exposition of current views on *Dharma,* which would furnish guidance to kings in following its precepts themselves and seeing that they were duly observed by their subjects. The voluminous character of the *nibandha* is due to its range and the growth of interpretation by the eleventh century. But it is not diffuse. What is said in a *kāṇḍa* is rarely reproduced in another. Lakṣmīdhara aimed at brevity. "Of authorities," he declares in one of the ślokas of the exordium to the digest, "on an identical topic, a text is given in one place and another in a different context, as required by its purpose; what is founded on correct knowledge is declared and what is basedon ignorance, even if popular, is rejected; ambiguities are cleared up, and only what is accepted by all authorities fully is stated; and where controversy has been endless, Lakṣmīdhara has given a decision[^1]."He assumes that he would be read by scholars who would not need elaborate explanations and who, from very brief indications and even without them, would know what *mantra* and *prayoga* to use in all cases. all cases. It is noteworthy that subsequent writers, who tried to improve on the *Kalpataru*, could only add the omitted matter, which might have well been left to the judge or the priest[^2].In Lakṣmīdhara's days it was apparently possible to proceed on his assumptions, but when in

later times, after the Musulman assaults and conquests, Brahmanical erudition became less common and priest and learning became divorced, there was more need for comment and guidance in *prayoga*, and writers like Hemādri, Vācaspatimīśra, Mitra-miśra and Nīlakaṇṭha by supplying thèm came to meet ordinary requirements more than Lakşmīdhara. In spite of his self-imposed restrictions, Lakşmīdhara's work attained a size which makes it stand only second to the *Vīramitrodaya* in mere bulk. In studying the *Kalpataru*, however, as in studying any other *nibandha*, the underlying unity must be grasped, and apparent omissions in particular places rectified by reference to the missing topics or treatment in other sections of the work.

  The uniqueness of the *Kalpataru* does not, however, rest on these features only. Its author was a scholarstatesman like Kautilya, Hemādri or Mādhava. He had the opportunity to enforce the Dharma which he expounded. Unlike Hemādri, he was a Bhaṭṭa, and perhaps also a *rāja-guru*. His father had held the prime ministership and the prestige of hereditary office was his. His restrained praise of Govindacandra, a really powerful monarch, is in marked contrast to the diffuse and exaggerated eulogies of their much smaller patrons with which other *nibandha* writers begin their works.[^3]In the prefatory verses to the *Rājadharma-kāṇḍa*, Lakṣmīdhara makes the open claim that Govindacandra's benevolent rule and wide conquests were due to his own advice as minister.[^4]In the introduction to the digest, Lakṣmīdhara states that he had made his sovereign rule the "ocean-girt Earth" and that the county's enemies had been destroyed by his own resolute fighting[^5].The

scholar was also a soldier-statesman. The *nibandha* was written by express command òf one of the most powerful rulers of the day. Even a favoured minister could hardly have been permitted to advance publicly, in a work meant for wide study, such high claims unless his services to the king and country were of such an outstanding character that their public recital was natural and permissible. The Gāhaḍvālas took a prominent part in the Brahmanical revival of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, to which we owe so many śāstraic and literary works in Sanskrit. They endeavoured to comport themselves as orthodox kings, following in the wake of the great rulers of the past, and worthy to be ranked with them. Their munificent gifts to pious men, on prescribed occasions and at *tīrthas* sanctified by tradition, are recorded in numerous inscriptions that have survived. Among the host of grantees who received royal gifts the names of Lakṣmīdhara and his father Hṛdayadhara do not figure, though from their birth, learning and reputation for orthodoxy, their fitness for *prati-graha* must have been well established. The omission is intelligible when one reads the stern enunciation of the inhibitions against theacceptance of donations[^6], particularly at *tīrthas*,[^7] ; also the following (cited in Tīrthaprakāśa, p. 89) :  तीर्थे न प्रतिगृह्णीयात्पुण्येष्वायतनेनु च ।  निमित्तेषु च सर्वेषु चाऽप्रमत्तो भवेन्नरः ॥              (मत्स्यपुराण)") as well as his

The *smṛtis* lay even more store on *ācāra* than upon a knowledge of Dharma[^9].If Lakṣmīdhara's life had been an exemplar of the ideals of conduct that he expounded in his *nibandha*, one can visualize the honour whichcame to him, even more from it than from the great offices that he held or his public services. The high authority attached to his views and the estimation in which the *Kalpataru* was held by later *nibandha* writers and commentators are the natural tributes to his wide and massive learning, his incisive logic and subtle mind, and the capacity to select, summarise and present the salient features of Dharma, strengthened by his experience as a judge. An omission to refer to a rule or practice by Lakṣmīdhara has been construed by later authorities as tantamount to a justification for its rejection.

   One would give much to know more of the life of so eminent a writer and statesmen. His reticence and the spirit of severe detachment in which his views and interpretations are stated restrict the evidence available. The facts of his personal history that may now be gleaned are few. That he had held with distinction the office of chief judge, when his statement of the law and his decisions (*vyavasthā*) evoked

expert admiration, is to be inferred from the introductory verse to the *Vyavahāra-kānda*[^10] नानाशास्त्रवचोविचारचतुरप्रज्ञाबलस्थापित-  न्यायादिव्यवहारमार्गविशदास्तास्ताः प्रगल्भा गिरः ।  यस्याऽऽकर्ण्य विपश्चितः प्रतिसभं रोमाञ्चमातन्वते  काण्डे स व्यवहारमत्र तनुते लक्ष्मीधरो द्वादशे ॥").The appointment as *Mahā-sāndhi-vigrahika*, (Minister for War and Peace ), which corresponds to that of Chief Minister, must have come to him later, probably when his father, who held it, died. The achievements and services to the kingdom and the sovereign, which are claimed as his in the introductory verses of the different *kāṇḍas* of the *nibandha,* were over when the digest was composed.[^11] Govindacandra's major achievement was the defeat of the Musulman invader (Hammīra, *i.e.*, Amīr)[^12].In the Rāhan plates (A.D. 1109) his defeat of the Gauḍa king is described in vivid language.[^13]. Introduction to Dānakānda, p. 41.")These are the only exploits of the king which are named in the *Kalpataru,* and it is improbable that his other conquests would not have been named also, had they occurred when the digest was composed. Royal *praśastis* are useful in determining dates; for, with each fresh achievement, the formula undergoes progressive modification.

Nor would the titles *aśvapati,* *gajapati, narapati, rājyatrayādhipati, vividha-vidyā-vicāra-vācaspati* have been missed by him if they had already been assumed by Govindacandra, when the *nibandha* was published.

As he was already *yuvarāja*, according to an inscription of 1099[^19],and a *yuvarāja* must atleast be a major (i.e., sixteen), Govindacandra cannot have been less than thirty years of age when he became king in name as in fact (1110 A.D.).

   Lakşmīdhara could not have been younger than his king. In the very beginning of the digest he describes himself as Chief Minister (*Mantrīśvaraḥ*). He had already been chief judge, probably when his father held the higher position of *Mahā-sāndhi-vigrahika.* He likens his task to a sacrifice (*yajña*) undertaken for the protection of the world (*viśva-pālana*)[^20]and he must have held his position for sometime to justify the boast that through his efforts tranquillity and prosperity came to the kingdom. He had acquired great wealth by means

[^20]: "शान्तिकाण्डोपक्रमे यथा—  'यस्मिन् बिभ्रति विश्वपालनमहायज्ञं द्विजन्मोत्तमे'"



approved by the *śāstras* (among which inheritance is one)[^21]and used it for such pious purposes as lavish offerings of *havya* and *kavya*, gifts of houses and endowment of *śrotriyagrāmas*, and built rest-houses for pilgrims and *steps* for bathers at *tīrthas*.[^22].")
Even if these could have been accomplished from inherited wealth by a young minister, filled with an avid desire to live the life of a *śrotriya* in affluent circumstances, the wide and many-sided learning and the marks of a mature mind which the *Kalpataru* exhibits, could not be those of a young man. The probability is that Lakṣmīdhara was much older than Govindacandra, that his chief services had been rendered during the regency, during which he had received orders to compose a great *dharma-nibandha*, and that it was published after the regent became King, about A.D. 1110. The claim made at the beginning of the *Mokṣa-kāṇḍa*[^23]that by his profound study of philsophy and skill in expounding abstruse doctrines, Lakṣmīdhara overcame 'the darkness of delusion' (*māyā-tamaḥ*) in the minds of even the elect could hardly have been put forward in a critical age by a person to whom ripe maturity of knowledge and judgment could not be conceded. Lakṣmīdhara's selection itself for a task, which would need years to complete, carries the implication of his having already acquired the necessary equipment and prestige as a scholar and as a Śiṣṭa.

PLAN OF THE KṚTYA-KALPATARU

The *Kṛtya-kalpataru* arranges its topics in a sequence which aims at following the ordered stages (*āśrama*) of life, as-





cending from conception and birth to the climax of *mukti* (release from rebirth), the goal of life's march. Each section of it is so connected with those which precede and those which follow it that in their aggregation they form a harmonious whole. No *smṛti* follows a logical order, though a rough approximation to a grouping of subjects is descernible in Manu and Yājñavalkya. There is much repetition and overlapping, as well as an absence of a due sense of proportion, if *smṛtis* are viewed in relation to the Indian conception of the fundamental aims of existence. Thus, out of the three sections into which *Yājñavalkya'*s work is divided, one is devoted to *vyavahāra*, and the other two to *ācāra* and *prāyaścitta*. The duties of kings are dealt with under *ācāra*.[^24] The commentaries of Aparārka and Vijñāneśvara, which are virtually digests, are lop-sided and incomplete as expositions of Dharma, by being restricted to their text. Lakṣmīdhara had more freedom. He could make his own arrangement without reference to an older scheme. He therefore planned the divisions of his digest in the order of the stages of life (*āśrama*). In the Indian view, the soul is born under a triple debt (*ṛṇa-traya*) to seers, ancestors and gods. The debt must be paid, and life is to be so regulated as to make the repayment possible. *Brahmacarya* discharges the *ṛṣi-ṛṇa*, the activities of the *gṛhastha* the *pitṛ-ṛṇa*, and the debt to the gods are discharged by the worship of divine beings. As civil society is divinely ordained and man has to function within it, a consideration of the bases of social activity, becomes relevant in a comprehensive review of Dharma. It is only when one has lived a full life, as laid down in the *śāstras*, that he can be regarded as ready for an advance to the goal of *mokṣa*.

[^24]: " I, 309-368."

                 THE PLACE OF PILGRIMAGE IN THE PLAN

  In Indian belief suffering is inseparable from life. All human effort should therefore be directed to find an escape from suffering. The final release comes only when re-birth ceases after *karma,* which clings to one like his shadow, is burnt out. An ordered life, lived under the discipline prescribed by the *śāstras* is the means to the end. Man rises or falls in the scale of existence, as he lives a well or ill regulated life. The ethos of life determines its destiny. For atonement that would



be effective one need not wait for a series of regulated lives. Even in this existence through one's own effort an advance to the goal is possible. The discipline of ordered ritual and ceremony helps to secure the mental tranquillity and the purity of the heart which are pre-requisites of emancipation. Many are the means of grace indicated by the scriptures. The worship of God with devotion and absolute self-surrender is among them. In the infinite mercy of God, He makes himself accessible to worshippers through images. Their worship (*pūjā*) is possible only after consecration (*pratiṣṭhā*). The specification of the rules governing both forms a necessary part of a complete statement of Dharma. Wealth and power tend to breed indifference to duty and even impiety. By sharing one's riches with the deserving, *i.e*., by way of gifts (*dāna*), he frees himself from the shackles of affluence. The practice of charity breeds sympathy to fellow beings and a sense of unworthiness for the bounties that one has received. They make one turn to worship in a chastened spirit. In a comprehensive exposition of Dharma, *dāna* therefore precedes both *pratiṣṭhā* and *pūjā*. The logical order is followed by the *Kṛtya-kalpataru*, and its fifth, sixth and seventh sections are devoted to these topics in the above sequenee.

  Divine providence is reflected in forest and hill, grove and stream. They contribute to the sustenance of life and add to the beauty of the earth. Sages and semi-divine beings are attracted to them, and they become sanctified by such association. The Supreme Being either reveals himself in such surroundings or is remembered in their context. Shrines arise towhich men turn for worship. To identify sacred streams and reservoirs with divinities is to follow a natural bent of the mind. The great rivers, and even ordinary streams, become gods. and goddesses, legends of their divine origin spring up and are cherished in folk-memory. Ablution suggests the mental purification which must precede man's approach to God. It is an easy transition therefore from the conception of the waters, which clean physically, to viewing them as purifying the spirit, if approached with faith and devotion. The purification of mind and body (*pāvana*) which a pilgrimage effects is identified with spiritual merit (*puṇya*) which can be accumlated and used to reduce the power of *karma* in lengthening the chain of rebirth. A stream or shrine or an old retreat of a semi-divine



sage (*ṛṣyāśrama*) radiates a beneficent influence which seems to sanctify and energise good actions performed near it. The banks of a sacred river or an 'abode of God' (*devāyatana*) are therefore eminently fit for the performance of *yajña, śrāddha* and *piṇḍa-dāna*. Their efficacy, when done in such environment, is bound to be greater than when performed in one's home. Holy rivers are veritable fords (*tara*) by which the stream of transmigration (*samsāra*) is crossed. They lighten the burden of sin and are rightly designated *tīrthāni.* The name then passes from streams to holy places since they too furnish a passage over the òcean of re-birth. Shrines and sanctuaries which rise on the banks of sacred rivers are classed as *tīrthas*. Even in a pessimistic outlook, existence and re-birth can be shortened by exercising the freedom to act in prescribed ways. An option to perform merit-producing actions or ceremonies at home or at a *tīrtha,* will naturally be exercised in favour of the second of the alternatives. The urge to pilgrimage will be strengthened by belief in its furnishing an inexpensive substitute for costly sacrifices or rites which are beyond the means of ordinary persons.

  In any exposition of the prescribed duties of man, therefore, the place of pilgrimage (*tīrthayātrā)* will come after the sections which deal with the normal religious duties (*niyata-kāla-kṛtya and śrāddha)*, the regulations of gifts (*dāna*) and the dedication and worship of God (*pūjā, pratiṣṭhā*). Lakṣmi-dhara's arrangement, which brings *tīrtha-vivecana* after the sections on *dāna, pūjā* and *pratiṣṭhā*, and places before them the two sections on *śrāddha* and daily rites (*āhnika* or *naiyata-kālika*) is therefore correct. The relegation of *vrata* (vows) and *Śānti* (propitiatory expiation) to sections coming after *tīrtha* is equally logical, as their purpose is merely to supplement the other activities.

  Lakṣmīdhara strictly follows this order. Others, like Mitra-miśra adopt a somewhat haphazard arrangement. In the *Vīramitrodaya*, the section on *Śrāddha* comes after those on *pūjā*, and *pratiṣṭhā* (which are in the the reverse of the logical order) and before those on *dāna* and *vrata.* The arrangement in Dalapati's *Nṛsimhaprasāda* is even more confused. For, its twelve sections are arranged in this order: *sāmskāra, āhnika, śrāddha, kāla, vyavahāra, prāyaścitta, karmavipāka, vrata, dāna, śānti, tīrtha and pratiṣṭhā. Vācaspati Miśra's 'cintāmaṇi'*



series was filled in as he found convenient, and the order of the appearances of its volumes can only be specified in cases where one of them refers to another. Thus *Āhnika-cintāmani* is mentioned in *Śuddhicintāmaṇī*, *Dvaitacintāmaṇi* in *Kṛtyacintāmaṇi* and *Nīticintāmaṇi* in *Vivādacintāmaṇi*. Raghunandana deals with *tīrtha* incidentally in Prāyaścitta-tattva,[^25]and the arrangement of his twenty-eight *tattvas* is also haphazard. Nīlakaṇṭha's digest, (*Bhagavanta-bhāskara*) omits both *pūjā*and *tīrtha*, but otherwise its order is logical and conforms to the plan of Lakṣmīdhara. The twenty-two works of his cousin Kamalākara, named in *Śāntiratna,* were not produced according to any previously thought-out plan. The section on *tīrtha*, named *sarva-tīrthavidhi* or more commonly referred to as *Tīrthakamalakāra*, comes as the twenty-first in the enumeration.[^26]

[^26]: "See footnote 1081, Ibid, p. 433,"

   All the world over, pilgrimages to sacred rivers, pools, mountains and to shrines at or near such holy places have held a powerful attraction not only for common people but even for the mental and spiritual elect. Now-a-days, they are undertaken from a mixture of aims, and the impelling motives are not always clearly formed in the minds of pilgrims. Perhaps it was so even in the distant past in which our epics and *purāṇas* were composed. That will account for the enumeration of the benefits of pilgrimage (*tīrtha-phala*) not only as regards particular *tīrthas* but *tīrtha-yātrā* generally, in the *Mahābhārata* and the *Purāṇas*. Divinity and power were ascribed to all rivers, streams and mountains, but some were more holy than others, and holiest of all was the Ganges.[^27]As in the body some limbs (like the right ear are more holy than others, so also on the earth some spots are more holy than others, because of the marvellous nature of their soil, the

Hence the need to describe the importance (*māhātmya*) of particular *tīrthas*. Accordingly, when a *tīrtha* is recommended, the indication is followed by a specification of the fruit of a visit to it (*tīrthaphala*)[^30].").In general terms, the advantages accruing from a pilgrimage are not only equal to those resulting from a sacrifice (*yajña*)[^31] reads the third line as तीर्थे फलं यज्ञफलं हि यस्मात्, but the sense in both readings is the same.")

To perform a *yajña*, one needs much expert help from priests; he must command much wealth, especially for the gifts (*dakṣiṇā*) which are necessary for their completion, and for the costly accessories and offerings; and he must have the co-operation of his wife so that an unmarried person, or a widower or an ascestic can not perform it. In short only kings and very rich persons can command the facilities for performing it. Not so with a *tīrtha-yātrā[^33].").*It has

Even the *caṇḍāla* who is excluded by Yājñavalkya[^35]")from all Dharma (*sarva-dharma-bahiṣkṛtāḥ*) is deemed eligible for *tīrtha-yātrā* by construction with the general rule of Śaṅkha that "all sins of (all) men are all destroyed at *tīrthas[^36].*"Neither sex, nor social condition, nor hereditary degradation springing from miscegenation, nor status in family or in society, nor poverty will be a bar to to the pilgrimage which will destroy sin and open the way to higher things and ultimate emancipation.

                     IMPORTANCE OF PILGRIMAGE CENTRES

 Every *tīrtha* was a sanctuary. If persons of proved virtue and blameless lives resorted to places of pilgrimage, so did manifest sinners, absconders from justice, conspirators against the state and offenders against society, whose right to it was logically considered superior to those of normal persons. Every person who took the pilgrim garb was not necessarily filled with the true fervour which alone would make a pilgrimage fruitful. The watching of *tīrthas*, especially those which drew most crowds, became a political necessity. Thus Kauṭilya advises the despatch of spies disguised as pilgrims to *tīrthas* to *kāśa,* to inadvertent pollution (p. 41). The latter quotes another general rule (p. 96):

अम्बुमध्ये गवां गोष्ठे तीर्थेष्वपि च पर्वसु।

राहोदर्शनकाले च सूतकं नैव विद्यते ॥



discover person disaffectedto the state[^41], enemies and thieves.[^42]The protection of pilgrims both on the routes which passed through their kingdoms and at the *tīrthas* within their own jurisdiction where, as strangers, they were vulnerable to deception or harm, threw a heavy duty on the Indian ruler, and the management of huge concourses such as would collect on specially sacred days at great *tīrthas* strained his organising skill. As a pilgrim was tax-free, the fiscal advantage to the kingdom was indirect and sprang from the dues paid by traders attracted to *tīrthas*, normally as well as on the occasion of very large gatherings (*mela*). The economic benefit to the kingdom was the expenditure of the pilgrim-tourist and the gifts which he made at *tīrthas* to local residents as part of the ritual of the pilgrimage. The recommendation for a pilgrim to assume the garb of a *kārpaṭika*, which is defined by Mitramiśra as wearing red caste marks, (*tāmra-mudrā*), a copper wristlet, (*tāmra-kaṅkana*) and a red robe (*kāṣāyavastra*) was probably designed to help in the identification of pilgrims, but it was facile disguise for fugitives from justice and criminals to assume.[^43].")Worldly motives might impel persons to undertake tours to *tīrthas* without faith in their efficacy, or in vedic rites; or they may even be materials believing in life ending when the body is consumed, who question the value of *tīrthas* and unrepentantly live sinfully during a tour which they have undertaken without faith. While even an accidental visit of a devout person to *tīrtha* brings him the merit of *tīrthasnāna*,[^44]")

TIRTHAPHALA

 The usual estimate of the value of a pilgrimage is that it is equal to that of a *yajña*. In some *tīrthas* the fruit is lower than that of the *agniṣṭoma*, and in others greater. The *Gṛhastha* (house holder) who maintains both the *gṛhya* and *śrauia* fires may look on a pilgrimage as optional or superfluous; but, in the words of the *Brahma purāṇa* this view is not correct, as *tīrthas* vary in their potency and some are more powerful in their effects than *agnihotra*.[^46].")
It is commonly believed that the mere act of doing a *yajña,* the mechanical process alone, confers on one the promised advantages, both in this life and the hereafter. The view overlooks the ethical associations of the act, without which it is ineffective. The spirit is more potent than the act. Unless an action is inspired by a devout feeling (*śraddhā*) it becomes futile. A *yajña* has to be looked on as not the sacrifice of material objects and possessions merely, but as an offering of the spirit. Every act done in the spirit of dedication and sacrifice, with a deep sense of their reflecting one's duty to the Highest, is a *yajña.* The king who enters on his duties with this feeling performs a *prajāpālanayajña.* A pilgrimage is not a pleasure tour; nor is it one which is undertaken merely for enlarging the range of knowledge and experience. Undertaken with utilitarian motives, it fails to become a *tīrtha-yātrā*, just as the mechanical adoration of the sacred fire or the offering of oblations or victims is not a *yajña*, when the spirit of surrender and devotion is not behind the action. The injunction of Indra to Hariścandra in the *Aitareya* *Brāhmana*[^47]to wander forth, because "fixed in their usual surroundings even the best of men become sinners (i.e. deteriorate), and (ultimate) happiness is for him who travels" is not to be understood as a recommendation of a mere secular or aimless journey.

resolution (saṅkalpa) with which a pilgrim must begin his *yātrā* brings clearly before his mind his lapse from virtue, for which the completed pilgrimage will furnish the expiation[^48].
The rigors of the *yātrā, e.g*. avoidance of vehicles[^49]. See inf. p. 11 where Lakṣmīdhara contends that the prohibition of conveyances applies only to a pilgrimage to Prayãga. This view is criticised by Mitramiśra on the ground that Kūrmapurāṇa extends the rule for Prayāga to all tīrthas."),
continence, fasting[^50]and austerities generally, are outward manifestations of the contrition which dictates the journey, and constant reminders of its higher purpose. The *yātrā* must be one-pointed. It must be undertaken in a spirit of faith in its efficacy. The mystic potency of a sacred stream may confer a minor benefit on the person who immerses himself in its holy waters, without even belief in its value. But to attain the full spiritual advantages of a *yātrā*, it must be commenced with a definite purpose andin the full faith that the journey, when completed in the proper frame of mind and without any lapse from the austerities prescribed, will yield the highest unworldly advantage. The assurance in *sthala*–*māhātmyas* that in certain *tīrthas* sin does not penetrate, is a tribute to their austere atmosphere and associations. Life affords numerous opportunities for an ascent to spiritual perfection, which will end re-birth. One of such opportunities is furnished by the discipline of pilgrimage which is not an end in itself but only one of the means to the highest end. This discipline lies less in the ascestic life of the pilgrim and his willing surrender of accustomed comforts but in the exalted frame of mind in which the *yātrā* is commenced,

[^48]: "The māhāsaṅkalpa usually makes a comprehensive enumeration of every conceivable sin, before proceeding to describe the desired benefit."

[^49]: "ऐश्वर्यलोभमोहाद्वा गच्छेद्यानेन यो नरः ।  निष्फलं तस्य तत्तीर्थं तस्माद्यानं विवर्जयेत् ॥  ऐश्वर्याद्यभिधानात् अशक्त्या यानेन गमने न दोष इति प्रतिभाति ॥  (तीर्थप्रकाशःp. 34

conducted and completed. The rewards held out to the pilgrim ranging from immediate relief from troubles and residence in other and happier worlds, and ending with the indescribable happiness (*paramānanda*), which is the ultimate reality springing from God-realisation, are the fruits not of the toilsome marches and the immersions in sacred streams and of the austere life lived in the course of the journey, but of the high ethical ideals cultivated and sustained by the pilgrim. If the streams could wash away spiritual dirt by mere immersion as easily as ablutions in their waters remove physical impurities, they would possess the Midas touch that would transmute the dross in man to spiritual gold. But this power they do not possess, unless the process is aided and controlled by high conduct and spirituality in the pilgrim. If mere physical association can effect the translation, the fish in the Ganges and the birds in sacred shrines are assured of beatitude[^51],and the sinful priest who resides in holy ground and preys on the pilgrims who flock to it, is as certain of salvation as the best of them. There is no automatic spiritual reaction to a mechanical act or rite in a universe dominated by moral law. Spiritual ascent is the fruit of a righteous life. The principle sublimates the concept of *tīrtha-yātrā*. A running stream is not the only *tīrtha*. There are mental *tīrthas* which are even more effiective than the physical. Truth is a *tīrtha*, forgiveness is another; control of the senses is a third; compassion to all living beings is a fourth; and other *tīrthas* are uprightness, charity, selfrestraint, contentment, continence, amiability, wisdom, steadfastness and austerity of life. But the best of all *tīrthas* is a pure heart[^52]. These are the waters which wash away sin. No ablutions can purify the covetous man, the miser, the sadist, the braggart and the voluptuary. They may bathe in every sacred stream and still remain as soiled as ever. The blackened heart is not washed clean by mere baths. Neither charity (*dāna*), nor sacrifice (*iṣṭa*), nor austerity (*tapas*), nor learning (*śruta*) nor pilgrimage (*tīrtha-sevā*) can bleach a nature that is black. Where dwells the man who has controlled his passions

[^51]: "See the eloquent passage, from the Brahmapurāṇa. inf., p. 8. Mitramiśra omits it."

are Kurukṣetra, Naimiśa and Puṣkara. He attains the highest end (*paramām gatim*) who is purified by knowledge (*jñāna pūta*), and washes away his affections and hatreds by the water of meditation[^53].This picturesque exposition of the elements of the pious life, is cited by Lakṣmīdhara at the very beginning of his *Tīrtha-kāṇḍa* with the obvious aim of correcting the vulgar view of *tīrtha-yātrā*. Looked at in this way, the concept of pilgrimage attains a moral elevation which places it side by side with other recognized means of grace. A virtuous life is the common denominator of all pious endeavour. It will be missing in the sceptic, the scoffer and in him who gloats on his sins; they are therefore held out as examples of persons who can never be redeemed by any number of pilgrimages. The will to do right is strengthened by suituble exercise and discipline. The aim of the ritual governing *tīrtha-yatrā* is to secure this co-ordination.

[^53]: "ज्ञानपूते ध्यानजले रागद्वेषमलापहे ।  यः स्नाति मानसे तीर्थे स याति परमां गतिम् ॥"

                         GRADATION OF BENEFITS

  The apportionment of duties so as to suit the capacities and the aspirations of those on whom they are laid is a feature of *Dharmaśāstra*. But desires out-run power. The ladder of effort has to be graduated so as to secure a slow ascent to the pinnacle. Those who are of "the earth, earthy" look for rewards which are immediate, which overcome visible unhappiness and bring common joys. The best minds crave for the arrest of the drag to rebirth (*punarbhava*). The glory of this life is the opportunity it gives for man to prove his mastery of his destiny. The highest aim of Life is to dispense with it once for all. The law of the moral conservation of energy, which rules the universe, destroys the tendency (*vāsanā*) to reincarnation only when sufficient merit is stored and sin is totally destroyed. When death comes, the individual is either lifted to a higher life by his good deeds or dragged to a lower by his sin. Post-mortuary existence still keeps up individuality, and rewards and punishments await the unreleased soul. The soul which is released by death follows either the path of the gods or the path of the ancestors (*devayāna, pitṛ-yana*), according to the nature of its past record. The former leads ultimately



to *Brahmaloka* or *Satya-loka*, the highest of the seven *lokas*, The and the latter to *Candraloka*, the region of the moon.[^54]soul that enters *Satyaloka* is not reborn; but that which enters the world of the Moon is re-born after it has remined in the happy reigion long enough to exhaust its store of merit (*punya*).[^55] The conception is varied in the Purāṇas and different regions are assigned to various divinities to which the blessed are transported. The soul of the devout pilgrim either returns to be reborn after a long period of joy in another and 'better' world, or makes no return to this world (*na punarāvṛtti*). We are told of the transit of the pious soul to *Gaṇeśaloka, Sivaloka* and *Sārasvataloka*.[^56]The promised rewards for visits to certain *tīrthas* or for worship at certain *kṣetras* are not to be taken literally, but to be understood to signify a high destiny for the devout pilgrim. But underlying the whole doctrine of the potency of a *tīrtha-yātrā* is the hypothesis that it depends on the possession of high moral and spiritual qualities by the pilgrim and on his making the pilgrimage without any relaxation of the rules laid down for their proper performance. The procedure laid down and the way of life prescribed for the pilgrim are devised to secure the retention and cultivation of morality and spirituality. A literary device for suggesting emphasis, with which students of even technical literature in India must familiarise themselves, is the use of exaggeration or over-statement. In medical works a useful drug is not only described as curing a specific disease, but all conceivable diseases. In art mental power is indicated by endowing a semi-divine person with many heads (*e.g*. Brahmā, Skanda, Rāvaṇa) and invincibility by a multiplicity of arms. In iconography, we find illustrations of the action of this device. Viṣṇu has almost always at least fourarms. So has his consort Lakṣmī, who is endowed with fourarms, except when she is in the company of Viṣṇu when she has only two arms, a device to indicate their relative position. Even in portrait sculptures, the king is represented in life size, while the queens standing by his side are dwarfed. Such verbal devices have to be properly discounted before a correct apprehension is reached. This is illustrated by the *phala*

[^54]: "Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad, VI, 2, 2."

[^55]: "Kauṣītaki Upaniṣad, I, 2, 3."

[^56]: " Infra. p. 52."



(fruit) attached to doing certain acts: a *yajña* a *dāna*, a *prāyaścitta*, and a *tīrtha-yātrā*, and the rhetorical description of their results. Taken literally, their effects are so overwhelming, that he who does one of the prescribed rites, has no need to attempt others. To each *tīrtha* the adherent efficacy is so great, if the *māhātmya* of that *tīrtha* is contrued literally, that there is no need to visit more than one *tīrtha*. That persons nevertheless go to innumerable *tīrthas* and shrine in the course of a toilsome pilgrimage is evidence of the spirit in which such florid descriptions of results are understood.

  Read casually, and without reference to its background, the Indian *tīrtha* seems to be endowed with a magical effect, which acts immediately on a pilgrim who visits it. Indian thought recognises the connection between mind and matter and stresses the value of a discipline of the body to produce a proper state of the mind. This is the justification for insisting on purity of food to ensure purity of the body and consequently of the mind. A suitable state of equanimity is possible only from control of the emotions or passions (*indriya-nigraha*). Yogic practices and training have the object of helping the conquest of the emotions and impulses. For ordinary persons, some restraint or even constraint, in a physical sense, is necessary to bring the body under perfect control. Austerity (*tapas*) takes many forms, but all of them have the same end. An extreme way of describing the value of *tapas* is not only to say that it conquers an individual but it affects the established order of nature.[^57]The purpose of the description is served if it secures a ready acquiescence in the value of austerity as a pre-requisite to victory over the spirit. Fasting, partial or complete, the practice of sexual continence, abstinence from unguents, soft beds and luxuries, rejection of the aid of vehicles or animals for making long and painful journeys[^58]. Mitramiśra allows the use of boats ( नौकायानं अयानं स्यात्). ibid, p. 35.  The taboos in a tīrtha are enumerated in Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇa thus: (Raghunandana's Prāyaścitta Tattva, I, 535)-")are

[^57]: "This is a logical extension of the idea that every act or thought must produce an effect on the Universe. In a vulgarised form tapas is described as a form of coercion practised on the higher powers."

illustrations of the application of the principle to the inhibitions of *tīrtha-yātrā*. For cleansing the mind meditation and contemplation are recommended. The development of religious consciousness passes, according to the Upaniṣads, through three steps: listening (*śravaṇa*), reflection (*manana*) and contemplative meditation (*nididhyāsana*)[^59].A rough parallel is seen in the disciplines of the pilgrim. He is to *hear* (*śravaṇa*) constantly the praise of his *tīrtha*; he is to *remember* it always (*smaraṇa*); he is to *chant* its name and praise (*saṅkīrtana*)[^60].
As meditation on the Deity in one of His manifestations has to be done to the exclusion of all thought of other manifestations, or of one god to the exclusion of other gods, to put it crudely, so the mind of the pilgrim must be centred on one *tīrtha* at a time to the exclusion of all others, and on one form of the Deity at the *tīrtha* (*ananyamanas*). Here is the significance of two rules for the pilgrim, *vis*., to begin the *yātrā* (journey) with a solemn declaration of his resolution and purpose (*saṅkalpa*)[^61]
and to abstain at any naming, *i.e*., thinking of any others.[^62]. The rule is–  नान्यत्प्रशंसेत्तत्रस्थस्तीर्थेष्वायतनेषु च ।")

[^59]: "Radhakrishnan, Indian Philosophy, I, p. 231."

[^60]: "This is best illustrated in the case of the Ganges. See for example Tīthaprakāśa, pp. 363-4 for the efficacy of गङ्गास्मरण, गमन, वास, उपासन, नमस्कार, मृत्तिकाधारण, स्पर्श, उदकपान and भक्ति."

 The efficacy of any religious rite is proportioned to the degree of the preparation of the body and the mind before it is commenced. An intensely devout feeling is necessary for the performance of every important action in life, material or spiritual. In a *tīrtha-yātrā* one gets an exceptional opportu-

nity to discharge the triple debt (*ṛṇa-traya*) to the gods, sages and ancestors. The performance of *homa* (fire oblation), the worship of deities (*pūjā*), the chanting of the Vedas, the doing of *yajña* (sacrifice), and pleasing sages and ancestors by rites of propitiation (*ṛṣi-tarpaṇa* and *pitṛ-tarpaṇa*), offering funeral cakes (*piṇḍa-dāna*) and doing *śrāddhas* are all commended at *tīrthas* as infinitely more effective than when done in one's own home[^63].The rationale of the commendation of these rites in a *tīrtha* will be obvious, without postulating any magical efficacy in its waters. None of these rites will ordinarily be approached in one's own home with that feeling of ecstasy and devotion with which the pilgrim, who has made the long tour, after undergoing the rigor of the *yātrā*, will being it with at a *tīrtha.* The magic which multiplies the efficacy of the rites lies less in the waters of the *tīrtha* than upon the moral discipline which the pilgrim has undergone before reaching it and his mental state after he does so. The saying of Pulastya, cited by Raghunandana[^64], that even he who performs in the Ganges the prescribed rites like baths, gifts etc., through cunning, or greed or for self-advertisement, goes to heaven, is only a picturesque way of stressing the sanctity of the Ganges. That the magic of the sacred stream was ineffective in the case of one who does not make the pilgrimage deliberately and at his own expense, and personally undergoing its rigor, is shown by the dicta of Śaṅkha and Paiṭhīnasi that he who comes upon a *tīrtha* accidentally, in proceeding on some other errand, he who travels at the expenses of another (as his paid deputy, for instance), or incidentally, gets only a fraction of the advantage (*puṇya*) that a true pilgrim derives.[^65]

   This aspect of pilgrimage is obscured by popular legends, and stories of miracles formerly wrought at certain *tīrthas* with the unconscious suggestion they convey that similar

[^65]: "infra, p. 11."



miracles may happen to the pilgrims who visit them. When pilgrimage becomes a habit, and a source of profit to those who live by exploiting it at the great *tīrthas*, the spirit and the dis-cipline, which are vital to the *yātrā*, are apt to be obscured or overlooked. That it was perhaps so even in the days of Lakṣmīdhara may be inferred from two circumstances. He has prefixed to the detailed consideration of the chief *tīrthas* a long quotation from the *Mahābhārata*[^66]ending with this pointed statement: "Accordingly, he attains the highest end (*paramāmgatim*) who 'bathes' constantly (*nityaśaḥ*) in both (*ubhayeṣu*) the mundane (*bhaumeṣu*) and the spiritual (*mānaseṣu*) streams (*tīrtheṣu*)". Later in the work, in dealing with miscellaneous *tīrthas* he makes another significant quotation from the same epic[^67] :" "Nothing is beyond the reach of the pilgrim (*na kiñcid aprāpyam*) who finishes a pilgrimage, conquering anger, lust and cupidity. Those holy places (*tīrthāni*) which are inaccessible (*agamyāni*), difficult to get at and hard to attain (*viṣamāṇi*), can all be reached by him (*gamyāni*) by mere thought of them." The Purāṇas have expressed the same idea in other ways. Great *tīrthas* like Kāśī have guardian gods, like Daṇḍapāṇi, whose duty is to expel from holy ground and stream all those who have sinned grievously or live in sin[^68]. The gods protect Prayāga.[^69] "Those whose lack faith (*aśraddadhānāḥ puruṣāḥ*) and those who minds are overcome by sin (*pāpopahatacetasaḥ*) do not attain.salvation in divinely protected Prayāga." Almost every *phalaśruti* is qualified by statements restricting the fruits of pilgrimage to those who are virtuous, and the pure in heart (*śuddhātmanām*.)[^70].
As stated by Albiruni[^71], most persons took *tīrthas* only on trust, without reflection or any enquiry into their sanctity. But it was not so with legists, like Lakṣmīdhara, who placed due stress on the ethical pre-requisites of their efficacy.

  In spite of the large part which pilgrimage has always played in Indian life, a formal treatment of it in the law books is wanting. That pilgrimages were very ancient is evidenced by literature of both Brahmanism and Buddhism. The animistic urge is seen in the deification of rivers as early as the Ṛg Veda. The sanctity of certain regions, like *Brahmāvarta* sprang from the rivers which flowed through it, or bounded it. In the famous hymn to the rivers,[^72]from which *ṛks* are quoted even to-day when going through the daily bath, as many as twenty-one out of the thirty-one rivers known to the Veda are hymned as deities. The splendour of the mighty rivers of the Punjab and Madhyadeśa are reflected in the *sūkta*. The first place is given to the Indus (*Sindhu*), "the Lord and Leader of the moving floods" and its tributaries are With compared to calves running to the mother cows. the exception of the Ganges, Sarasvatī, and the Jumna (Yamunā) the commemorated streams are those of the Punjab and the North-West. The anthropomorphic tendency invested forest and stream with divinity, and the recommendation to seek the seclusion which they offered for meditation in the last two stages of life enhanced their attractions. Their sanctity is stressed by so early a *smṛti* as that of Gautama (XIX, 15) who uses the term *tīrthāni* in describing them.[^73] That there were lakes or rivers, which were deemed holy, whose water was believed to have special virtues in purification, is implied in another maxim of his[^74]. *Viṣṇusmṛti* equates *tīrtha-yātrā* with *aśvamedha* (horse-sacrifice) as the effective expiation for the major and minor sins.[^75]A long chapter[^76]is devoted to an

enumeration of *tīrthas* like *Puṣkara* where baths, the performance of *yajñas*, the practice of austerities (*tapas*) and the offering of *piṇḍas* to the manes and the doing of *śrāddhas* is is effective. A pilgrim is free of ferry dues[^77]. One who ispurified by *tīrtha-yātrā* sanctifies a whole assembly[^78]. The water of the Ganges is praised for its superlative purity[^79].
The bones remaining after the cremation of a dead body should be thrown into the Ganges, and "as many bones as are contained in the waters of the Ganges, so many thousands of years will the dead man live in heaven[^80]."The list given by *Viṣṇusmṛti* embraces many well known *tīrthas* spread over the whole of India. It is evident that by the time of the composition of the work, the practice of pilgrimage to many of the reputed *tīrthas* was well established. Vasiṣṭha[^81]lauds those ancestors alone as having true descendants, when the latter offer them food in *śrāddas* performed at Gayā. An allusion in Manusmṛti[^82],shows the high sanctity attached at the time to pilgrimages to the Ganges and Kurukṣetra, which in the Epic and the Purāṇas are equated in spiritual efficacy (*puṇya*). The extant fragments of *Bṛhaspatismṛti* contain the *pitṛ-gāthā* lauding the perfor-

The value of a *śrāddha* at Gayā is stressed by Yajñavalkya[^87]and the addition of a conjunctive particle to the name is explained as signifying that other similar places are implied, which have equal sanctity. The long prose passage, cataloguing and classifying *tīrthas*, which is cited from Devala by Lakṣmīdhara (pp. 249-250) suggests an earlier *sūtra* work as its source. The later *smṛtis*, which are laid under contribution for passages on *tīrthas* are not noted for their antiquity, but they probably repeat older authorities how lost.

 The high antiquity of pilgrimage's to sacred rivers and sites is however beyond question. In Kauṭilya's days they









attracted mixed and large congregations of pilgrims. Long before his days certain places were regarded as so holy as to merit selection for the performance of the biggest sacrifices (*sattra* ). The *Śrauta-sūtras* of *Āśvalāyana*[^88]and *Lāṭyāyana*[^89]
recommend sites on the banks of the Sarasvatīfor such sacrifices, while *Kātyāyana-śrauta-sūtras*[^90]states that the lustral bath at the end of the *sattra* was done in the Jumna or the Kārapacā.

   The great epics furnish the most authoritative source forn *tīrtha-yātrā*. The Ganges and other rivers of Madhyadeśa and the streams by which Rāma dwelt have an express or implied holiness in the *Rāmāyaṇa*. For the superlative holiness of *Setubandha,* the ultimate sanction is found in the words of Rāma in the *Yuddha-kāṇḍa*[^91] where Samudra appeared before Śrî Rāma and pledged his help. See the remarks in Govindarājīya on the untenability of the stories in Kūrma-purāṇa and Padma-purāṇa that Śrī Rāma installed a linga of Śiva (Mahādeva) there. The sanctity of Rameśvaram is founded on these and other Purāṇas: e.g. Tīrthaprakāśa, pp. 557-560.").But the epic of pilgrimage par excellence is the *Mahābhārata*. Among the heroes of the great

[^91]: "CXXVI, 16–22.  एतत्तु दृश्यते तीर्थं समुद्रस्य वरानने ।  यत्र सागरमुत्तीर्य तां रात्रिमुषिता वयम् ॥  एष सेतुर्मया बद्धः सागरे सलिलार्णवे ।  तव हेतोर्विशालाक्षि नलसेतुः सुदुष्करः ॥...  एतत्तु दृश्यते तीर्थं सागरस्य महात्मनः ।  सेतुबन्ध इति ख्यातं त्रैलोक्येनाऽभिपूजितम् ॥  एतत् पवित्रं परमं महापातकनाशनम् ।  अत्र पूर्वं महादेवः प्रसादमकरोत् प्रभुः ॥  The last half-verse is explained by Govindarāja às referring to Darbhaśayana ( Tamil, Tiru-p-pulāṇai









epic, Balarāma, the Pāṇḍavas, and Arjuna performed pilgrimages. Accounts of the sanctity of *tīrthas* are given by the sages Pulastya, Lomaśa, Dhaumya and Angiras. A large section of the *Vanaparva* (ch. 78-158) is entitled *Tīrtha-yātrāparva*. To the *nibandhakāras* the *Mahābhārata* is a fundamental source on pilgrimage. The inclusion of *Mahāprasthāna*under *tīrtha* by Lakṣmīdhara must have been obviously. suggested by the seventeenth book of the great epic, though for the ritual he suggests he has to cite only puranic authority (inf. pp. 558-264).

    The Purāṇas and Upa-purāṇas are the main sources on pilgrimage. Many of them deal with little else than *tīrtha*, *sthala* and *kṣetra*-*māhātmya*. But it is noteworthy that Lakṣmīdhara does not draw upon the following major Purāṇas: *Agni, Bhāgavata, Gāruḍa, Kūrma, Nāradīya, Śiva* and *Saura*[^92]. But he draws extensively on the following Upa-Purāṇas; *Āditya*, *Devī*, *Kālikā* and *Nārasimha purānas*. Among works of the class dealing with the same *tīrtha*, he has rejected some and chosen others. The circumstance that he omits any, notice of certain famous *tīrthas* or areas completely, which are dealt with in the Purāṇas he quotes for other *tīrthas*, might suggest that either he rejected the claim to sanctity of the "holy places" he omits to treat of, or that the recensions of the Purāṇas available to him did not contain the matter they now contain[^93]."). A prominent omission is that of the shrines and sites in *Utkala* (Orissa) to which great attention is paid by the Brahma and Skanda Purāṇas which he utilises[^94] are barely mentioned on p. 235 in the long extract from Prahlada's tīrtha-yātrāfrom Vāmana-purāṇa.

Aninstance in point is 'the sacred way' in Benares, which all modern pilgrims tread, *viz*. the *Pañcakrośī*, of which he makes no mention, though it has appeared in certain recensions of the *Skānda* *Purāṇa* for over four centuries[^95] at Benares is from the Brahmavaivarta and Mitramiśra relies on it (op. cit. pp. 220-236).").

LAKṢMIDHARA'S TREATMENT

   Lakṣmīdhara's treatment of *tīrtha* in a *nibandha* was in all probability a pioneer attempt. He cites no earlier authority. Gopāla's contemporary work, the *Kāmadhenu*, over which he claims superiority for the Kalpataru, may have dealt with *tīrtha*. Mitramiśra cites Śrīdatta Upadhyāya as alluding to citations made by both the Kamadhenu and the *Kalpataru* on the subject of the removal of hair from the head by the pilgrim to the Ganges (*muṇḍanam*), but like the allusion to the citation from the *Kūrmapurāṇa* by Halāyudha, to which he refers on *Vṛddhi-śrāddha*[^96], the *Kāmadhenu* passage might have occurred in a section of that digest that did not treat of *tīrtha-yātrā*alone. The revivalist tendencies of the Gāhḍwāla dynasty, which he served, and the location of many of the holy places within the dominons of Govindacandra should have strengthened the wish to dedicate an entire section of the digest to pilgrimage. The limitations of his interest or geographical knowledge are perhaps indicated by the sketchy references to the *tīrthas* outside his own kingdom, and such errors as bringing the Kāverī in the chapter devoted to the Narmadā! In Albiruni's time the *tīrthas* of Kāṣmir were visited by Hindus

as also the shrine at Multan before it was destroyed[^97]. The boast of Kalhana[^98]that in his native land there was not the space which a grain of sesame would cover that had not its *tīrtha*, is justified by the remains of ancient objects of worship at springs and on river banks throughout Kāṣmīr, several of which claim to be self-revealed (*svayambhū*). Kalhana mentions about a dozen in the first canto of his chronicle. The *Vitastā*, (Jhelum) the chief river of the valley was regarded as a manifestation of Śiva's consort, Gaurīand Nandikṣetra as the permanent abode of Śiva. In Kāṣmīr, dwelt Śāradā, and her temple on a low hill was well-known in the middle ages. The omission of these in the Puranas as well as in treatises on tīrtha, like their omission to stress the sanctity of the great streams of the old Aryan area in the Punjab, must be due to the areas having fallen under the control of *mlecchas*, with fears of their desecration and the impossibility of reaching the *tīrthas* except by passing through regions controlled by powers which did not respect the Hindu traditions and beliefs. It is noteworthy that such famous *tīrthas* as Mount Kailasa and Mānasa-saras, which were equally inaccessible on the same grounds, are neglected in *tīrtha* literature. Going to a *tīrtha* through an excluded area is allowed, and it was feasible when such an area was inhabited by Hindus and under the rule of Hindu kings. But when they passed under hostile occupation even tracts which had been the homes of ancient sages had to be omitted even in comprehensive accounts of places of Hindu Pilgrimage. Lakṣmīdhara's citation of the passage from the Mahābhārata (p. 245) which names the rivers of the Punjab and refers generally to the rivers of Kāṣmīr, which are affluents of the *Sindhu* (Indus), occurs only in the chapter on 'miscellaneous' *tīrthas*, while *tīrthas* now forgotten but which enjoyed a vogue in his days like Sükara and Stutasvāmin have indepen- dent sections assigned to them. The discrimination reflects his practical aims.

EVOLUTION OF THE TIRTHA THEORY.

   The primary basis of belief in *tīrthas* is the recognition of invisible and beneficent agencies in springs, fountains, rivers and the ocean. In a wider sense water itself is spiritualised, as in the Upanişads, its cleansing virtues being ascribed to a



non-physical character. It is the garment (*vāsaḥ*) of the breath of the life (*prāṇa*). Its subtle essence becomes life's breath[^99]. It is the source of the "five primordial elements" (*pañca bhūtāni*) of life[^100].In the beginning the Universe was water, and from it was born everything[^101].Water is the foundation of the universe[^102].").The Supreme Being is known as Nārāyaṇa because water (*nārā*) is His abode (*ayanam*). Water and Wisdom are known by the same name, *nārā*, and God abides in both[^103]. Naturally water is a cleansing agency par excellence. Rinsing the mouth with water cleanses the "breath" (*prāṇa*[^104]).The rite of sipping water (*ăcamana*, *upasparśa*) is the most efficacious method of purification, and it has to be gone through, as preliminary, to any act with spiritual significance to produce the requisite antecedent purity[^105]").Water is the body of Viṣṇu[^106].").According to the *Śatapatha* *Brāhmaṇa*, water is the abode of truth[^107].The invocation of the Supreme Being as the Lord of Waters, at the application of the ordeal by water, is thus logical (*Nāradasmṛti*, p. 123, vv. 316-7), for "nothing is more capable than water and fire to bring out the difference between truth and falsehood[^108]."In the *Atharva*

*Veda* the curative power of water in disease is implied in the invocation of Water as the healer[^109]. The belief that a *tīrtha*, which is pre-eminent in sanctity, like the *Setubandha* or *Gañgā*, is a remedy for diseases which have defied the physician is founded on two notions: *viz*., that water is the great healer, and that it destroys sin in certain *tīrthas*, sins being the causative factors in producing diseases[^110]. The *Śatapatha* *Brāhmaṇa* which sees in the waters the divine nymphs (*Apsarasas*), the brides of the Wind-god (*Vāta*), gives a poetical expression to the natural beauty of streams or rippling water[^111].Anthropomorphism follows animism.

[^111]: " S. B. E., XLIII. 232."

   Other conceptions now enter into the theory of Tīrtha. The efficacy of a religious act depends on the mental and physical purity with which it is done. The spirit (*bhāvanā*) in which any act, religious or secular, is approached affects its fruition[^112]. This is why a scoffer and a sceptic are denied the benefits of the *tīrtha* (*inf*. p. 6). The discipline of the body brings mental purification. The inhibition of conveyance and luxuries in pilgrimages has this aim. The ceremonial tonsure, which has to precede an immersion in a sacred stream, and without which even a pilgrimage cannot be begun, is an act of purification. The *Gṛhyasūtras* enjoin the shaving of the head of the boy who is to be initiated. They also insist on it before rites, vows and fasts. In the Brāhmaṇas[^113].")the shaving of the beard and hair of the sacrificer is enjoined before the

commencement of the *yajña*. The termination of studentshipis marked by tonsure[^114].Shaving terminates a period of impurity (*aśauca*) springing from death or birth. The customs are world-wide and reflect the belief that hair is infected with the virus of taboo and its removal removes the taboo[^115]. Works on *tīrthayātrā*, and on Hindu ritual generally, are full of discussions of the occasions when tonsure of either or both sexes is obligatory, as the omission is held to prejudice the effect of a religious act.

[^115]: "e.g., J. G. Frazer, Golden Bough, IV, p. 283."

    Fasting is another means of self-purification which is enjoined. It has to be done as a penance before important spiritual acts like *śrāddha*, a major *dāna* (like *kanyā-dāna*) in absolute or graduated forms. He who has offered a śrāddha to the manes and he who has partaken of the food offered to them, must abstain from eating on the night of the ceremony. Manu prescribes a fasting for twelve days (*parāka*-*kṛcchra*) for the total removal of sin[^116].Gradual reduction of the food is a familiar form of penance in the Gṛhyasūtras. When calamitous incidents occur, purification is necessary. Hence fasting is enjoined when an eclipse takes place, or a king dies or a cow or a Brāhmaṇa comes to grievous harm[^117] – न गोब्राह्मणोपरागेऽश्रीयात् । न राज्ञो व्यसने ; compare also अपरार्क, ४२६-४३०.").Fasting, without due reason, is however sinful. Except for penances, the Brahmacãrī and Gṛhastha, who follow their appointed duties (*tapaś*-*caret*) without food, commit the sin of starving the vital fire and are ruined[^118].This is why Sāňkhāyana explicitly rules that a Gṛhastha should not starve during a journey[^119].

[^119]: "शा. गृ. सू., २, १७, ३"



SIN AND PILGRIMAGE

   The regimen of *tīrtha-yatrā* is also brought into close association with two other ancient beliefs, *viz*., sin with the means of expiating it, and the duty of ancestor worship, which had developed elaborate theories of their own in India. makes for unhappiness in this as well as other lives. There are grades of moral obliquity, whose consequences are correspondingly graded to last through one or more lives. Writers on expiation (*prāyaścitta*) like Sūlapāṇi have classified sins (*pātaka*) as dealt with in *smṛtis* under nine divisions of which the four chief are *mahāpātaka*, *anupātaka, atipātaka* and *upa-pātaka*. The classical enumeration of *mahāpātakas* makes them five, beginning with the slaughter of a Brāhmaṇa (*brahmahatyā*), and their effects are said to last for seven lives[^120] killing a Brāhman, drinking spirits, theft (of gold), adultery with a Guru's wife, and association with such sinners."). Thirty-five *anupātakas* are named as equal to *brahmahatyā*. Revolting sins (*ati-pātaka*) are incest and its analogues. The "minor sins" (*upa-pātaka*) are classified as forty-nine. Among them are such fairly grave moral offences as adultery with a married woman, and abandoning one's parents, wives, children and teachers and selling oneself or one's wife or children into slavery. Cow-killing, usury, theft; neglect of Vedic study, eating forbidden food and marrying before an elder brother are also brought within this category. The purpose of the classification is to indicate a common cosmic effect for all sins of the same class and a common form of expiation. Even the gravest sin is within the scope of penitential expiation[^121]. He concludes- एतैव्रतैरपोहेयुर्महापातकिनो मलम् ॥").Much acumen is displayed by commentators and *nibandhakāras* in making subtle distinctions between offences, and in explaining the apparent prescription of very severe or comparatively light penances for an offence bearing the same name, like *Brahmahatyā*. The *smṛtis* are so largely taken up with this subject, that their commentators, as well as digest-writers, have evolved a vast literature on sin and expiation. To those

[^120]: "They are according to Manusmṛti (XI, 55

[^121]: "Manusmṛti prescribes prāyaścitta for each of the five deadly sins (XI, 89, 92, 101, 105-107



conversant with it, the brief indication of the benefit of a particular *tīrtha* is enough, e.g., that it is able to destroy a major sin (*mahāpātaka-nāśana*) or *ati-pātaka-nāśana*, or, reversing the method of indication confer the same benefit as an *aśvamedha* (horse-sacrifice) or *agniṣṭoma*. For, in the schedule of sins and expiations, *aśvamedha* is the sovereign spiritual remedy for all mahāpātakas. So, if a bath is described, as is one at Benares (inf. p. 21) as conferring a spiritual benefit equal to that arising from the performance ten horse-sacrifices, it is to be taken as an emphatic way of saying that the bath is a penance for a *mahāpataka*. The elliptical method of indication has to be understood in a work like the present, since it assumes in the reader the requisite knowledge of *prāyaścitta* literature.

FASTING

   Another elliptical indication in *tīrtha-yātrā* and other*kṛtyas* which has to be understood in its full implication is *upavāsa* or fasting. Before a *yātrā* is begun and after it is concluded, the pilgrim is enjoined to worship Gaṇesa (to avoid obstacles in the course of the journey) and propitiate gods, ancestors and Brāhamaņas by worship, *śrāddhas* and liberal feeding, accompanied by *dakṣiṇā* (gifts of money). One thing more he has to see to before he starts on the pilgrimage and that is to fast. So far as mere abstention from food goes, *upavāsa* may range from one meal, (*ekāhāra*) or a meal of fruits, roots etc., to total rejection of food for the entire day and night. But it implies a great deal more. Its wide range is indicated in a picturesque etymology. *Upavāsa* is "living" (in union with good qualities) with one's face averted (*upāvṛttaḥ*) from sins. In the 'enjoined' (*vaidheya*) fasting there should be starvation from morning to evening, and from evening to dawn. On the day before and on the day following a "fast," the following should be eschewed: eating out of a bell-metal plate, collyrium, meat, spirits, liquor, greed (*lobha*), idle talk (*vitatha-bhāṣaṇam*), physical exercise, siesta, anointing body and head, acceptance of hospitality, gambling, and excessive drinking of water. On the actual day of the fast, the following are to be avoided: collyrium to the eyes, painting the forehead, flowers, garlands, scents, spices, anointing the head and body, mid-day siesta, playing with dice, familiar talk



with women and sexual intercourse[^122], p. 260."). A fast is not broken if one partakes of water, milk, roots, fruits and medicines[^123].Even with the relaxations allowed, the regimen was so severe for many people that *upavāsa* by deputy was permitted in "unavoidable" cases. A wife or a husband may endure a fast on behalf of the other partner, a son for his father, brothers for one another and a sister for a brother, and a well-conducted Brahman for any one[^124]. The *upavāsa* had to be observed on the days preceding a *śrāddha*. As *śrāddhas* are enjoined during a visit to a *tīrtha*, it follows that a long pilgrimage entails many "fasts."

PILGRIMAGE AND SRADDHAS

The practice of the *śrāddha* has its roots in ancestor worship, which can be found in most primitive communities. In a rationalised form, it has survived among all ancient peoples, like the Chinese and the Hindus. In China, and possibly elsewhere, the worship of gods may be traced back to ancestor worship[^125].The rites of ancestor worship forge a permanent bond between generations of the same family, and, as the manes both in the male and female lines are to be satisfied by it, and marriage outside a *gotra* is the rule, the *śrāddha* provides a bond of union between many families and over some generations. The continuity of the family and consanguinous relationship are enforced by the practice. person owes a debt to ancestors to whom he owes his being. The *śrāddhas* repay the debt. As they can be done only by are said to exult in male descendants ordinarily, the manes the birth of male children in their line, as they will be ensured offerings of śrāddha[^126].Ancestors exercise a benign oversight

[^125]: "Texts of Confucianism, S. B. E., XXVIII, p. 67."

[^126]: "Cf. quotations from Bṛhaspati, Viṣṇu, Yama and Vasiṣṭha on p. 167, ff. infra."



on dutiful descendants in the line. "The dead person, maintains *Viṣṇusmṛti*, "and the performer of the *śrāddha* are sure to be benefitted by its performance. Perform the *śrāddha* always abandoning useless grief. This is the duty which should be constantly discharged towards a dead person by his kinsmen[^127]."The manes enjoy as celestial food in their existence after death, whatever it be, as their share of the oblation of a *śrāddha*. As a Vedic sacrifice establishes a friendly and beneficial relationship between men and gods, so a *śrāddha* ensures the mutual dependance and helpfulness of the living and the dead. Accordingly, the performance of it is enjoined before every auspicious family event, like the initiation of a boy (*upanayana*), ante-natal ceremony (*sīmanta*, *pumsavana*), marriage, house-occupation and *tīrtha-yātrā*. The type of *śrāddha* which is performed on auspicious occasions is known as *abhyudaya-śrāddda* or *vṛddhi-śrāddha[^128]").* For the performance of other kinds of śräddhas also a tirtha is recommended as highly efficacious. Ancient legends of the origin of certain *tīrthas* like Gayā are held to enforce the high efficacy of the śrāddhas performed there[^129]. The Ganges was brought down to the earth to give release to the manes of the ancestors of Bhagiratha who had been destroyed for their irreverence to a divine sage[^130]. The great river is therefore a *pitṛ-tīrtha* which surpasses all others, and the performance of every form of śrāddha at Benares or on the banks of the Ganges is regarded as supremely meritorious[^131].

[^127]: "२०, ३६-३- प्रेतस्य श्राद्धकर्तुश्च पुष्टिः श्राद्धे कृते ध्रुवम् । तस्माच्छ्राद्धं सदा कार्यंशोकं त्यक्त्वा निरर्थकम् ॥"

PLENARY INDULGENCES OF PILGRIMAGE

  The association of *śrāddha* and upavasa intensified the high seriousness with which pilgrimages were begun and performed. An act of supreme merit carries its own purification. A *tīrtha-yātrā* is such an act. Accordingly, plenary indulgences surround it. *Aśuddhi* (pollution) arising from birth or death affects a pilgrim no more than it does one who has entered on a *dīkṣā*[^132] that one who is under pollution (Sūtakī) should not go to a tīrtha is explained. by Mitramiśra as forbidding the commencement of pilgrimage when one is under pollution.") The touch of others does not pollute a pilgrim: during Even a journey there no *spṛsṭa-aspṛṣṭa[^133] . “स्पृष्टास्पृष्टिर्न दुष्यतीति वचनं पक्कान्नशुद्धौ कल्पतरुकृता लिखितम्, तीर्थपक्कान्नस्पर्शे न दोष इति । अत एव पुरुषोत्तमक्षेत्रादौ तथैव शिष्टाचारः” (मित्रमिश्राः)").*prolonged absence, incidental to pilgrimages in ancient times, will not affect adversely one's rights to and in property[^134]"). Those who hesitate to undertake a long pilgrimage by fear of inability to complete it by death on the way are reassured. If they die in one of the many holy places, at which death ensures immediate release (*mokṣa*) like Kāśī or Prayāga, they are all the better for having undertaken the pilgrimage. If the pilgrims die in the course of the journey, they gain the full benefit of the *yātrā* which they had hoped for[^135] explains the merit of death during the journey to a tīrtha as equal to that accruing from fasting for a month. He who is obliged to discontinue a pilgrimage has to do a penance.").

[^136]: "See inf. p. 11"

TĪRTHA-NIYAMA-TONSURE

  The solemnity of the pilgrimage is enforced by other rules. Personal purity is essential. It is secured by baths, scrupulous attention to daily rites and duties as well as the inhibitions on food, fasting and a virtuous life. But the *mana* of certain incidents or conditions entails personal impurity which invalidates pilgrimage. The death of parents incapacitates one for pilgrimage for a year[^137]. तीर्थस्नानं महादानं परान्नं तिलतर्पणम् । अब्दमेकं न कुर्वीत महागुरुनिपातने ॥"). Certain astronomical conjunctures cast a general shadow over all auspicious acts, among which pilgrimages must be included[^138]. When a man's wife is *enceinte*, he is unfit to undertake a pilgrimage, if she is in an advanced state of pregnancy[^139]. But once the pilgrimage is begun, the question of auspiciousness of days or seasons does not arise, and in the great *tīrthas* all days are auspicious for baths and *śrāddhas*[^140].All that is needed is that before entering a *tīrtha*personal purity must be ensured by fasts, tonsure and baths. It is noteworthy that while Lakṣmīdhara has prescribed the fast (*upavāsa*) and personal purity (*kṛtopavāsaś-śuciḥ, inf. p.* 9) he has not prescribed tonsure (*muṇḍana*) though he was aware of the Puranic authorities making it obligatory at all or some *tīrthas*.His omission is deliberale. He maintains that (p. 11) the prohibition of the use of conveyances to approach a *tīrtha* is made only in the context of Prayaga, and therefore does not apply to journeys to other

*tīrthas*, and *tīrtha-upavāsa* is optional because it is only intended for additional efficacy of the pilgrimage (*inf*. p. 11). Mitramiśra, dissenting from Lakṣmīdhara, holds that both tonsure and fast are indispensable elements of *tīrtha-snāna*(pp. 34, 48 and 51) on the ground of their adoption by *śiṣṭas*(pious and learned men). Vācaspatimiśra is also criticised by Mitramiśra (following Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭa) for holding that tonsure is unnecessary before a bath in the Ganges, on the ground that the text on which the former relied is corrupt and substitutes Gayā and Gaṅgā for Kurukṣetra, and that the general rule that 'what applies to Prayāga applies to all *tīrthas*' (*sarva-tīrtheṣu ayam vidhiḥ*) extends the ritual of *Prayāgasnāna* to all holy places.

   Lakṣmīdhara simplifies *tīrtha* ritual by making fasting optional, omitting tonsure altogether, explaining the *pitṛ-pūjā* at a *tīrtha* as an obligation of only the opulent (p. 10), allowing conveyances for the journeys, sanctioning vicarious pilgrimage (p. 11) and allowing as many *śrāddhas* as may be needed to be done at a *tīrtha*, irrespective of the time of beginning them, in a single day. To him purity of mind and devout feeling (*viśuddha-manovṛttiḥ*, p. 9) were the essential things in a His pilgrimage and the rites adventitious in comparison. liberalising influence was resisted by later writers. They made *vṛddhi-śrāddha* at the commencement and the termination of the journey compulsory[^141]. They insisted on tonsure, and prescribed it even on the *upavāsa* day of the arrival at the *tīrtha*though it is contrary to a general rule[^142].They whittled down the result of the pilgrimage to a fraction of what it would be if conveyances or shoes were used in the journey[^143].They denied the absence of untouchability in a *tīrtha-yātrā* and *tīrtha*and limited it to inadvertent pollution only[^144](p. 41). Tonsure was made compulsory, and even prohibited days for shaving are over-ruled and allowed for it[^145].In the case of married women alone the removal of a lock of hair instead of tonsure was allow-

ed[^146].  —यतिः शूद्रश्च विधवा सशिखं वपनं चरेत्,  and critises Vācaspatimiśra for rejecting tonsure before a bath in the Ganges.").Bathing was enjoined immediately on attaining a *tīrtha* even if it be night, when ordinarily a bath in a river is objectionable[^147].A bath at a *tīrtha* alone is allowed in *malamdāsa*(i.e. a month in which two new-moon days occur) when sacred acts are ordinarily void[^148].The rule of Śaṅkha-Likhita, cited by Lakṣmīdhara in another section of his nibandha, prohibiting the passing of a river without performing *pitṛ-tarpaṇa* was stressed[^149].The *tarpaṇa* is to be done even at night (*ib*. p. 68). It should be done immediately after the bath[^150].But anchorities,even though allowed to make pilgrimage, are not to perform *tarpaṇa*. The credentials of a Brahman engaged for a ś*rāddha* at a *tīrtha* are not to be scrutinised[^151].  This exempts the piligrim from the scrutiny hemustmake of the fitness of the person to whom he makes gifts or invites to Sraddhas. (See ब्राम्हणरीक्षाin पराशरमाधविय, I, ii,pp. 336-361.)").A ś*rāddha* at a *tīrtha* is not to be done at night by the Vaidikas. It maybe done even by persons whose parents are alive[^152].

ADDITIONS TO TIRTHA RITUAL

  The rules for the completion of a visit to a *tīriha* were enlarged by the introduction of a number of prescriptions drawn from analogy.The *tīrtha*, being divine, confers merit on those who go round its bounds, walking from the left to the right (*pradakṣiṇam*). In the case of Kāśī, perambulation of the “sacred way” (*Pañcakrośī*) is prescribed by the *Kāśīkhaṇḍa*, and it is euologised by Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭa and  




INTRODUCTION

Mitramiśra, who were residents of Kāśī.[^153]Lakṣmīdhara was also a resident of the holy city, and it is remarkable that he makes no mention of this circumambulation and makes no quotation from *Kāśikhaṇḍa*. The advice to the pilgrim to make a *namaskāra* to the *tīrtha* as soon as he sights it is corollary to treating a *tīrtha* as a divinity or the chosen abode of many divinities. The *śrāddha* at Gayā cannot be done by one *both* of whose parents are alive (*jīvatpitṛ*), but it may be done by one who has lost his mother but for his mother only[^154].This is because it is a *śrāddha* with its full ritual. On entering the precincts of a tīrtha the resident divinities should be "seen¹,"but*liṅgas* which have been polluted by the touch of Śūdras or by *pūjā* by women should be ignored[^155].Every gift at a *tīrtha* has far more efficacy than when made elsewhere. But gifts bless more the giver than the recipient. Gifts should not be accepted lightly, unless they be gifts of land[^156].Impurity arising from a birth in the family does not affect a pilgrim[^157].The point of junction of a river with the ocean or another river (*saṅgama*) is a hundred times more holy than the river itself[^158].The emancipation arising from death at a *tīrtha*, like Kāśī or Prayāga, accrues to one who dies near an ammonite (*Śālagrāma-śilā*) or in a garden of *tulasī* (ocymum sanctum) plants[^159].

  This rule enables Mitramiśra to bring in many local divinities like Bhairava, (p. 208), the fifty-six Gaṇeśas of Kāśī (p. 239), Duṇdi (p. 212), the twelve Ādityas (pp. 272-277) and Caṇḍikā (p. 277). Most of them find no place in Lakṣmīdhara's work, and the existence of their shrines at Kāśī in the twelfth century is open to doubt.

[^160]: "ibid., 9. 2134."

OCCASIONAL TĪRTHAS

  Besides places or waters which are permanently holy, some become so on special occasions, when their sanctity is equal to that of well-known *tīrthas*. These are usually connected with the occurence of astronomical conjunctions, which occur rarely. One is the conjunction known as *ardhodaya*. It occurs when, in the months of *Māgha* or *Pauṣa*, a new-moon falls on a Sunday, and the rising constellation is Ś*ravaṇā*(during daytime) and the *yoga* is *vyatīpāt*[^161].")*a*[^161].").*Vyatīpāta* is one of twentyseven *yogas* or astronomical combinations. It occurs when thenew moon falls on a Sunday and the rising constellation at the time is one of the following :—Ś*ravaṇā*, *Aśvinī, Ārdrā, Āśleṣā*and *Dhaniṣṭhā*[^163].").*Vyatīpāta* is ordinarily regarded as unlucky for any auspicious action. But a bath in the Ganges during *Vyatīpāta* is regarded as capable of redeeming innumerable members of a family[^164].").The *Ardhodya* being a special kind of v*yatīpāta*is even more effective, for, when it happens, *all* waters gain the sanctity and virtue of the Ganges, and all Brahmans become equal to those who are of pure mind and and pious disposition[^165].It is therefore described as *mahodaya* i.e., *mahāphala*, “capable of yielding great benefit.” Eclipses of the Sun and the Moon are similar occasions when a miraculous transformation of the nature of waters takes place, and

every well, pool, tank or river gains the virtues of the Ganges[^166]— स्वर्धुन्यम्भःसमानि स्युः सर्वाण्यम्भांसि भूतले । कूपस्थान्यपि सोमार्कग्रहणे नाऽत्र संशयः ॥ स्वर्धुनी = देवनदी = गङ्गा.").Another combination which requires the conjunction of the planet Jupiter and the constellation *Maghā*. It happens only once in twelve years, and is viewed as endowing certain tanks with the virtues of all holy rivers, beginning with the Ganges. On the rare occasions when it recurs, the place where the tank is situated attracts immense numbers of bathers[^167] to take place. It attracts immense crowds.").Such *tīrthas* should be regarded as occasional *tīrthas*, but ordinaryworks on *tīrta-yātrā*do not take note of them. If on such occasions, every river or tank gains the virtues of the Ganges, the Ganges itself must be more powerful for good than usual andabath in it be priceless. Gifts made and prayers uttered on such occasions are very powerful in their effects. The bearings of astronomical conjunctions on the sanctity of *tīrthas is*further indicated by Purāṇic specification of certain times as specially good for certain rivers, and as periods of impurity for them for three days, owing to *rajodoṣa*. The Ganges is however always pure.

TĪRTHAS: THEIR NUMBER AND CLASSIFICATION

 Tīrthas are countless and so are holy temples or sanctuaries (*āyatanānī*). New *tīrthas* probably arose from time to time, indicated by miracles, and were added to the accounts in the Purāṇas. No section of this vast literature has been as susceptible to interpolation as that which deals with *tīrthas* and *sthala-māhātmyas*. This is one of the reasons for applying to any *tīrtha* or any ritual in a *tīrtha* the test of its acceptance by persons of well-known piety and sanctity ((śiṣṭaparigraha) as śiṣṭācāra is one of the recognized sources of Dharma. But even those mentioned in the major Pu

rāṇas and the Mahābhārata make a considerable number. The *Śabda-kalpadruma*, which has utilised this form of literature more than any other indigenous work of reference, gives a list 264



*tīrthas* arranged in the order of their due perambulation from the left to the right. Thirty-five millions of *tīrthas* are said to exist in the three worlds (*bhuvi, divi, antarikṣe*). Many *tīrthas* are named in one and the same locality. As many as 300 have been named at Kāśī alone. The number of independant *tīrthas* named in Lakṣmīdhara's work does not fall short of this figure. But, in accordance with the aim implicit in the title he gave to his treatise, *viz*., *Tīrtha-vivecana*, he has freely exercised the power of selection and rejection. He omits whole areas, and his example is followed by later writers. Someśvara III (1127-1138), the son and successor of Govindacandra's rival Vikramāditya VI, composed an encylopaedic work named*Mānasollāsa* or *Abhilaṣārtha-cintamāni*[^168].His treatment of *tīrtha-snāna* is interesting[^169]").The indication of *tīrthas* is prefaced by a declaration, that tapas can accomplish everything that a pilgrimage to distant and inaccessible *tīrthas*can accomplish (v. 122). The rivers named are the Ganges, "the best of rivers," the Jumna, the Narmadā, the Tāpī, the Gotamī (Godāvarī), Pañjarā (Paingangā?), the Bhīmarathi (Bhīmā), Kṛṣṇaveṇī (Kṛṣṇā), Bṛhannadī(Mahānadī), the Malāpahāriṇi (Malparbha) at its junction with the Kṛṣṇāand the Tuṅgabhadrā, and “other rivers." It is noteworthy that all these were within his dominions. Famous rivers like the Kāverī and the Tāmraparṇī, which run through the dominions of the Colas, the hereditary enemies of the Cālukyas, are ignored. Prabhāsa in Gujarat, Kedāra, Prayāga, the river Sarasvatīand the "very sacred" (*mahāpuṇyā*) Vārāṇasī are mentioned in a way that betrays absence of personal knowledge. Compared with Lakṣmīdhara's list that of Someśvara is very meagre, but it suggests an underlying principle in selection, *viz*. recommendation of easily accessible places or rivers. The same principle rules the major *tīrthas* named by Lakṣmīdhara and explains his omissions. Vācaspatimiśra brings in the famous *tīrthas* of Utkala, particularly Puruṣottma-kṣetra

(Pūri-Jagannāth). In the days of Mitramiśra several *tīrthas*, which were frequented in the twelfth century, had disappeared. Not only had new *tīrthas* come to notice, but new shrines in ancient *tīrthas* like Kāśī, and he duly commemorates them. Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭa carries selection to an extreme by dealing with only three *tīrthas*, namely Prayāga, Kāśī and Gayā, which were still living places of pilgrimage whose sanctity received universal homage. The relative space devoted to each *tīrthas* reflects the predilections of the authors. In *Tristhalīsetu*, nearly two-third (244 pages) is taken up by Kāśi, a fifth by Prayāga and one-sixth by Gayā. Mitramiśra devotes also the largest space given to any single *tīrtha*to Kāśi (184 pages). His next largest sections are those dealing with Gayā and Prayāga, and he gives a separate chapter to the Ganges (pp. 355-375). To a Maithila like Vācaspatimiśra, Gayāand the *kṣetras* and *tīrthas* of Utkala are more attractive, and of course the Ganges, which is a common attraction. Only a fifth of the *Tīrthacintāmaṇi* is taken up by Kāśī and Prayāga, while Utkala covers nearly two-fifth of the work. The Ganges and Gayāreceive more generous treatment than Prayāga the"king of tirthas" (*Tīrtha-rāja*) and Kāśī the city of Viśveśa. The preferences are suggestive.

**TIRTHA-VIBHAGA**

  

An ancient classification of *tīrthas* is given in the *Brahma-Purāṇa[^170]*.*Tīrthas* are of four kinds: *Daiva, Āsura, Ārṣa* and *Mānuṣa,*according to their origin. The first consists of sacred places revealed by Brahmā, Viṣṇu or Śiva. If the three gods have all sanctified a *tīrtha* it attains the utmost sanctity. Kāśi, Puṣkara and Prabhāsa are illustrations. The Sarasvatīsprings from Brahmā, the Ganges from Viṣṇu and the Narmadāfrom Śiva. Among *tīrthas* called *Daiva* are the Ganges, the Jumna, the Sarasvatī, the Jhelum and the Beas (*Veṇikā*) and among the rivers south of the Vindhyas the Godāvarī, Bhīmā, Tuṅgabhadrā, Kṛṣṇa-veṇī (*Veṇikā*), Tapti, and the Pain-Ganga (Payoṣṇī). Reservoirs, which are not due to human labour, are *Daivakhāta* ("dug by gods"). Gayāis an *Āsura-tīrtha*. *Ārṣa-tīrthas* derive their holiness from sages (ṛṣi). "Human" *tīrthas* are those made holy by rulers of the solar and lunar dynasties.

[^170]: "LXX, 16, ff."



**EXCLUDED AND HOLY AREAS (VARJYA PRAŚASTA-DEŚĀḤ)**

  In the smṛtis and old literature the holiness of an area or spot is measured by its fitness for the performance of sacrifices. They are graded in a descending order by Manu:[^171]first *Brahmāvarta*, the land between the Sarasvatīand Dṛṣadvatī, next the *Brahmarṣideśa* (the country of the Kurus and Pāñcālas and the Matsyas and Śūrasenas), then the Madhya-deśa (extending from the Sarasvatī, where it disappears in the sands, to Prayāga) and *Āryāvarta*, the land between the Himālaya and the Vindhya and the eastern and western oceans. By a wider rule all lands over which the black antelope (*kṛṣṇa-mṛga*) roams is deemed sanctified[^172].Before *Manusmṛti*, in the days of Baudhāyana[^173]*Āryāvarta* did not include the Punjab, Bengal and Bihar, Sindh, Gujarat, Rajputana, Malwa and the Dakhan. It lays down that he who visits Magadha, Aṅga, Vaṅga, Kaliṅga and Sauvīra *except* on a *pilgrimage* must undergo fresh *saṁskāra*. *Viṣṇusmṛti* regards all places where the system of four varṇas as in force as within *Āryavarta*[^174]."). But taking advantage of certain Purāṇic passages, some Mithila scholars prohibit the crossing the Karmanāśa even during a pilgrimage. Others push the eastern limit of the holy land further upto the river Karatoyā, marking the boundary between Bengal and Assam[^175].The acceptance of a further principle that ‘any country in which there is holy t*īrtha* or shrine to which pilgrimage is enjoined is approachable' brought virtually the whole of India within the field of *tīrtha-yātrā*. It made for the promotion of spiritual and cultural unity of India.

COMMENDED TIRTHA PRACTICES

  In a general review of *tīrthas* some common features emerge. Baths, vows, prayers, gifts and funeral ceremonies like *piṇḍa-dāna*, *tarpaṇa* and *śrāddhas* are usually recommended for performance at almost every important *tīrtha*. Propitiatīon of the divinity resident in a *tīrtha* is done by chanting its name during the journey, by recalling to the memory its sanctity, by cultivating devotion to it and by making *pūjā* to it[^176].Today a picturesque custom is the evening hārati (waving of lamps) to the Jumna at Muttra. The Ganges receives *pūjā* from almost every pilgrim, and flowers, cocoanuts, fruits and *tāmbūla* are ceremoniously thrown into a *tīrtha*. Milk and flowers are thrown into the lake at Puṣkara. Strings of names of the great *tīrtha* are recited. The mud of the Ganges and its waters are believed to possess sovereign virtues[^177].The sale of *Gaṅgā-jalam* is prohibited, though it is now commonly done[^178].Sweeping the streets of Kāśī is meritorious (*inf*. p. 22). In the normal funeral rites, the bones which remain after cremation of the dead body are collected and buried in a pot in the bed of a running stream. The throwing of such bones into the Ganges is specially recommended[^179],and it harks back to the legendary origin of the mighty river, and its invitation to the world by Bhagīratha for conferring *mokṣa* on his condemned ancestors by flowing over their ashes. Special ritual for the throwing of the bones into the water of the Ganges (*asthi-prakṣepaṇa-prakāśa*) are given in the manuals on pilgrimage[^180].While under a taboo which interdicts his pilgrimage one who has lost a parent or any other relation for whom funeral ceremonies have to be performed by him, is still allowed to make the journey to the banks of

the Ganges for the sole purpose of depositing the bones into the sacred stream, within the interdicted first year after death[^181].").The glory of Kāśī is its being a grand crematorium (*mahāśmaśāna*[^182].) The banks of the Ganges at Benares are studded with cremation grounds. As other attractions of the holy river and "the city of Śiva"include dying within its bounds and on the banks of the Ganges, the creamatoria are often crowded, and funerals are apt to be delayed. By a special dispensation allowed only to Kāśīthe ordinary interval between a cremation and the collection of the mortal remains that remain after it (*asthi-sañcayana*) is abbreviated, and that ceremony is allowed to be done immediately after the body is devoured by the fire.

[^182]: "See infra, p. 23:- ' श्मशानम् ' इति विख्यातम् अविमुक्तं शिवालयम् ।"

  To live till death releases one is regarded as an unfailing means of obtaining salvation in most major *tīrthas*. It is specially emphasised in the case of Kāśi. To dwell within its sacred bounds even for a few days is good, but to live there till death is the best one can do[^183]").In the somewhat grotesque imagery of the Purāṇas, a pilgrim to Kāśī is recommended to break his legs on a stone, so that they may not run away with him from the holy city[^184]")!A *sanyāsin* (anchorite) ordinarily attains *mukti* by entering the ā*śrama*[^185]").But, he is doubly sure of it if he lives and dies at Kāśī

. He is interdicted from undertaking the *annual* perambulation of the *fifty-krośa* pathwhich forms "the sacred way," that encircles the city, because in doing it, he may have to cross the strict boundaries



of Kāśi[^186].These rules seem to have been gradually evolved, and find their culmination in the *Kāśīkhaṇḍa* of *Skandapurāṇa*. That some of them were *not* in force in the twelfth century is to be inferred from the silence of Lakṣmīdhara about them, in spite of the great space assigned to Kāśi in his work. The result is that Kāśi has long been a city of the living as well as a city of the dying and the dead. A considerable section of its population has been made up of floating elements, and a large proportion of its inhabitants has been awaiting the advent of death. *Tīrtha* literature endeavours to banish the fear of death in the devout. For no *tīrtha* is it done so thoroughly by suggestion, recommendation and rule as for Kāśi. A cremation ground conveys impurity to all who tread it[^187].Kāśī, the greatest cremation ground of all[^188], is the exception.

[^186]: "Tirtha-prakāśa, p. 166:  'मध्ये कुर्यादसीवरणयोः कृती' इति संन्यासिनोऽसीवरणोलङ्घननिषेधः ।एतानि वचनानि कल्पतरुकारादिभिरलिखितानि ॥"

[^187]: "There is an expiation for treading a cremation ground. See extract from Varāha-purāṇa in Sabda Kalpadruma, p. 145."

  Power is reflected in freedom from customary restraint. The great *tīrthas* illustrate it. The world over, suicide is reprobated. In India, the suicide (ā*tmaghātaka*) is condemned to postmortuary penalties which follow the soul. "Those who take their lives reach after death" says the *īśāvāsya* Upaniṣad (3) "the sunless regions, covered by impenetrable darkness[^189]."On secular and religious grounds Kautilya condemns it[^190].The *Brahmapurāṇa* (cited by Nanda Pandita in *Vidvanmanoharā*, p. 133) classes those who commit suicide by poison, fire, hanging, drowning, or falling from a cliff or tree, with those who

[^189]: "असूर्या नाम ये लोका अन्धेन तमसा वृताः । तांस्ते प्रेत्याभिगच्छन्ति ये के चात्महनो जनाः ॥"

[^190]: "Artha-śāstra, IV, 7, cited in my Rājadharma, pp. 180-187"



commit *mahāpātakas* (cardinal sins[^191]).Such persons should not be cremated nor should the usual funeral rites be performed for them. This is the rule. To it five exceptions arestated in the Purāṇas and Smṛtis (1). Sati or self-immolation of women, either with (*sahamaraṇam*) or after (*anumaraṇam*) the cremation of their husbands comes first (2).Suicide by drowning is not only permitted but enjoined at the confluence of the Ganges and the Jumna at Prayāga, and as sanction for it a verse in *Ṛg Veda* ( khila ) is cited[^192].
Selfcremation at one of the *tīrthas* is also commended. Among other commended forms suicide are hanging head-downwards over a blazing fire and cutting up one's flesh and offering it to birds of prey. The inducements held out are happiness and sensual enjoyments in another world, for thousands of years and lordship of India after re-birth. Death by fire self-lit at Avimukta (Benares ) is said to free from re-birth the person who so ends his life[^193].Death by slow starvation is also lauded as capable of conferring salvation. (3) The Purāṇas permit persons, who suffer from incurable diseases, or who are too old to do their appointed religious duties, to terminate their lives voluntarily by drowning, starvation, falling from cliffs, or self-cremation[^194].(4) It is specially recommended for

The condemnation is explained away as inapplicable to religious suicide, as it is deliberately done, without any passion."

ascetics. The case of Kalanos, the Indian ascetic, who burnt himself over a pyre in the camp of Alexander the Great, is an instance in point. (5) Terminating one's life towards the end by *mahā-prasthāna* is a recognised form of exit from this vale of misery. Lakṣmīdhara devotes a chapter (the last) to this kind of journey (yātrā). The pilgrim walks on till (yātrā). he drops down dead or he loses his life by fire or in the Himā- layan snow (*inf*., p. 258). Suicide by fire and by falling from a cliff is brought under *mahāpatha-yātrā*, i. e., "journey by the wide path" by Lakṣmīdhara. *Tristhalīsetu* and *Tīrthaprakāśa[^195]*discuss at some length the apparent conflict between the inhibition of suicide in general and its commendation when done at Prayāga, the Ganges etc. Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭa regards death at Prayāga or by suicide in one of the indicated ways as an inferior way of death, and as dictated by the desire for a definite gain (*kāmya-phala*), and not by the desire for *mokṣa*. It is therfore like the condemned *śyenayāga*, indicated for the attainment of a definite object, *viz*., destruction of an enemy, but not a commendable ceremony. Mitramiśra brings such forms of suicide as falling from a cliff and self-cremation under the practices interdicted for Brāhmaṇas in Kali Yuga (p. 354). Lakṣmīdhara underlines the practices. The writers of the 16th and 17th centuries (who are divided in opinion on the obligatory nature of *sati*) are united in explaining away the time-honoured forms of self-slaughter at Prayāga, in the Ganges and at Kāśi. The progress of opinion against forms of religious suicide, as against *sati*, is noteworthy. Suicide at Pehoa near Thanesar (Pṛthūdaka) (inf.. 180) is mentioned by Lakṣmīdhara, in a quotation from the *Mahābhārata*, but he does not mention the merit of suicide at Kurukṣetra, which is recommended by *Liṅgapurāṇa*, of which he makes extensive use in treating of Benares. But Mitramiśra cites this passage (p. 475, op. cit.). Suicide by fire or water, and above all by *bhṛgu-patana* (falling headlong from a cliff) at Amarakaṇṭaka is mentioned by Lakṣmīdhara (inf., p. 200). These suicides are different from those prescribed by the *smṛtis* as expiation for *mahāpātakas*, since a pilgrim must already possess the moral qualities specified, which alone make his pilgrimage fruitful. Inscriptions give instances of historical personages.

DETAILED CONSIDERATION OF TIRTHAS

  Lakṣmīdhara's work on pilgrimage is mostly taken up with a detailed enumeration of *tīrthas* and *sub-tīrthas* and citations of authority for their sanctity. Compared with Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭa's discussions as well as Mitramiśra's, of the general aspects and rules of pilgrimage, Lakṣmīdhara's treatment of these is very meagre. But it is not to be supposed that he deemed them to be unimportant. Many of them like *dāna*, *śrāddha*, and the special merit accruing from ceremonies performed at certain times (*niyata-kāla*) he has dealt with in the sections of his digest which treat of them. The design of his work made its divisions interdependent, and he avoided repetition as far as possible, in the expectation that the digest would be studied as a whole. The space so saved is devoted by him to an elaborate enumeration of holy places, which, for its size, makes the *Tīrtha-Kalpataru* relatively fuller than even the *Tīrtha-prakāśa* of Mitramiśra.

**KASI**

  In Lakṣmīdhara's treatise Kāśī has the first place[^197].Its treatment is also more generous than that of other holy, piaces. This is not to be explained as due merely to the holy city being the virtual capital of the dynasty and kings he served, or to his being a resident of it. By the twelfth century, Benares had attained the position of premier *kṣetra* in India. Albiruni notes early in the eleventh century that the city attracted anchorites in thousands from all over India[^198].").It still does so. An anchorite stands less in need of pilgrimage to assist him to cross the stream of *saṁsāra* than a layman. In Buddhist times, fifteen centuries earlier[^199],*sannyāsins*

[^197]: "So is it in Tīrtha-prakāśa. Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭa takes up Prayāga first, as the pilgrim makes the approach in pradakṣiṇa form."

from Kāśī retired to Himalayan forests for this purpose. The practice had obviously changed. The Gāhaḍvālas take pride in styling themselves protectors of Kāśī, Kuśika, Indraprastha, and Ayodhyā, even more than as kings of ancient Kanauj[^200]—  येनोद्धारितरप्रतापशमिताशेषप्रजोपद्रवं श्रीमद्गाधिपुराधिराज्यमसमं दोर्विक्रमेनार्जितम् ॥ तीर्थ काशि- कुशिकोत्तरकोसलेन्द्रस्थानीयकानि परिपालयिताधिगम्य । हेमात्मतुल्यमनिशं ददता द्विजेभ्यो येनाङ्किता वसुमती शतशस्तुलाभिः ॥").Lakṣmīdhara himself refers to Govindacandra as *Kāśīpati*[^201]. See pp. 48-49, Introduction to Dāna-kalpataru.").Many of the Gāhaḍvāla grants were issued from Kāśī. Rājghāt, now at the northern end of the city, was in all probability the ward in which the kings of the dynasty dwelt. This would explain more convincingly than an assumption of Vaiṣṇava leanings of the eclectic kings of a city dedicated to Śiva[^202],the circumstance that many of the gifts, recorded in the grants. of not only Govindacandra but of his father Madanapāla, and his grandfather Candradeva, and his grandson Jayacandra were made at the ancient shrine of Keśava, at the confluence of the Varaṇā and the Ganges, at the northern edge of the fort at Rājghāt. Some of the grants show that they were made at shrines in Kāśī dedicated to Śiva, like Vedeśvara, Trilocaneśvara, Aghoreśvara, Kṛttivāseśvara, Indreśvara, Omkāreśava, Svapneśvara, or to Sūrya, like Lolārka, at the confluence of the Asī and the Ganges at the south end of the city. Koṭitīrtha is mentioned in an inscription of Govindacandra as the place at which he bathed before making one of his many grants. Everyone of these sites or shrines is among the *tĪrthas* of Kāśi mentioned by Lakṣmīdhara. From the tenth century onwards, inscriptions in even distant South India bear indirect testimony to the supremacy of Kāśi among holy places by regarding as the deadliest of all sins the slaughter of Brahmans and cows at Kāśi[^203].

[^203]: "Ibid., p. 26."



  This pre-eminence in sanctity was evolved in the course of centuries. The name Kāśī itself, in spite of the ingenious etymologies[^204],suggested or popularised after it became the spiritual capital of India, is derived from Kāśa, seventh in descent from Purūravas, grandson of Manu, who is said to have founded the kingdom[^205].Among his successors was Dhanvantari, the founder of Indian medicine. In the Upaniṣad, Kāśī appears as the capital of Ajātaśatru, a philosopherking[^206].").In earlier Vedic literature it does not figure, except as a remote place. In the days of the Buddha, it was just a big town, though his selection of Sārānth on the environs of the city, for his first sermon might indicate that it had spiritual qualities. The Gṛhyasūtra of Hiraṇyakeśin names Kāśiśvara among the gods to be worshipped along with Viṣṇu, Rudra, Skanda and *Jvara* (fever)[^207].It would prove the worship of Śiva at Benares in the fifth century B.C. The last name recalls the exorcism in the *Atharvaveda*[^208]"),banishing a fever to those who live in Kāśī, Magadha and Gāndhāra. They were all perhaps infested by malaria. *Manusmṛti* places the eastern limit of *Madhyadeśa* at Prayāga, and Kaśī is well out of the area[^209].Kāśī is not among the *tīrthas* of which a long list is given in *Viṣṇusmṛti*, at which the performance of śrāddha, the muttering of prayers, the offering of burnt-oblations and the practice of austerities "confers eternal bliss" (ch. 81). The only reference to Kāśī (under its other name Vārāṇasī) in the *Mah*ā*bh*ā*rata* occurs in Pulastya's enumeration of *tīrthas* in ch. 82 of the *Tīrtha-y*ā*trā-parva* of the Vanaparva. It lies in a single śloka stating that one may proceed after Koti- tīrtha to Vārāṇasī, worship Śiva (*Vṛṣabha-dhvaja*) and attain the merit of performing a horsesacrifice by bathing there in Kapilāhrada. He should then proceed to the confluence of the

Gomatī(Gumti) and the Ganges, and visit Mārkaṇḍeya-tīrtha situated there. This is how the passage runs in Lakṣmīdhara (inf, pp. 940-1). The Kumbakonam edition of the Mahābhārata, however, has three lines between the above two verses. They state that a pilgrim (*tīrtha-sevī*) who goes to Avimukta (Kāśi) is released from the 'sin of killing a Brahman (*Brahmahatyā*), and the man who dies there attains *mokṣa*'. That these lines were interpolated after the twelfth century is evident from Lakṣmīdhara's omission to include them in his citation. That, however, before the third century A. D. Kāśi had become a notable place of pilgrimage, specially valuable for the performance of Vedic sacrifices, is clear from epigraphic testimony. The devout Śaivas, the Bhāraśivas, performed horse sacrifices and had lustral baths at Daśāśvamedha on the Ganges at Kāśi[^210].In the first century A.D., Benares was within the dominions of the Kuśaṇas, and a viceroy ruled over it[^211].To Kāśi its pre-eminence was really the gift of the Purāņas which undertook to spread the cult of Śiva. Beginning by stressing (as did the later *Bhaktim*ā*rga*) the inferiorityof Vedic sacrifices as compared to devotion to God (Śiva), they ended by making the city of Śiva' (Ś*ivapurī*,. i. e. Kāśi) the best place for the performance of those sacrifices. In this syncretism of Vedic and non-Aryan cults at Kāśī lay the secret of its wide appeal. and its rise to the first place among our *tirthas*[^212]").  
  The nominal capital of the Gāhadwālas was Kanauj. But before they took it, it had suffered from enemy attacks, both Hindu and Muslim. It had been sacked by the Rāṣṭrakūṭa Indra III about 916 A. D. It was again destroyed by Mahmūd of Ghazni in 1018 A. D. It was too near the Muslim frontier.

[^211]: "Altekar, op. cit., p. 18."

[^212]: "Dr. A. S. Altekar maintains that Śiva was orginally the the non-Aryan God of Kāśī, who was opposed to Vedic rites. The incidents of Dakṣa-yāga, as recounted in the Śaivite purāṇas emphasize this antagonism. Kāśi was the shrine of Maheśvara in the 7th century A.D., (Beal's Si yu ki, II, pp. 44-55.



The situation of Benares made for greater safety[^213].After having been for centuries an important centre of trade and industry, it became under the Gāhadwalas the virtual capital of an expanding kingdom. Even in the eighth century, its wealth and reputation as a holy place made it the gathering place ail sorts of persons. The satire of Dāmodaragupta has pictured the gay life of the rich and luxurious city which then, as now, attracted the *demi-monde*, although it was  
a great *tīrtha*[^214]. Damõdaragupta, who lived in Kāṣmīr in the reign of Jayāpīḍa (779-813 A. D.), works on the idea of their attaining Sāyujya (likeness) with Śiva, and lays the scene of his poem in Kāśi.").Lakṣmidhara's treatise on tirtha seems deliberately to aim at the magnification of Kāśī. As neither his king nor he were worshippers of Śiva by choice, his euology of Kāśī looks like propaganda. The powerful Karṇa of Cedi, whose territories were partially conquered by Govindacandra, had built, or perhaps re-built the Karṇeśvara temple at Kāśī, attracted doubtless by its name[^215].").The desire to be remembered at a spot which all India visits is natural. Mān Singh of Jaipur is reported to have attempted this by vowing to erect a hundred-thousand shrines in one day "by cutting out on blocks of granite a great many tiny carvings each repre- senting a temple." About 340 shrines are named by Lakṣmīdhara at Kāśi[^216].He probably made an exhaustive enumeration. Many shrines, which he has not mentioned, came to view or were erected after his time, and are noticed in the works of Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭa and Mitramiśra. In his capital (*r*ā*jadhānī*) Śiva must have the full complement of his *parivāra* (retinue) Among them the chief are his consort Pārvatī, known by many names, Nandī, Vināyaka and Bhairava. In the old Liñgapurāṇa accounts, which are utilised by Lakṣmīdhara, the diffe-

rent deities, male and female, nāgas, asuras and sages, vie with one another in installing *liṅgas* in honor of Śiva within the sacred bounds of Vārāṇasī. The list of founders. of such shrines virtually includes every Purāṇic celebrity. The planetary deities are among the devotees of Siva who have done the pious work. In process of time, those who founded such shrines, came themselves to be worshipped at them. Thus Śani (Saturn)is said to have dedicated a *liṅga* near old Viśveśvara, and the shrine was named as that of Śanaiścareśvara (the Śiva of Saturn[^217]).In the shrine only Saturn is now worshipped.

[^217]: "Infra, p. 67."

  A comparison of the accounts in the *Liṅgapurāṇa* (which Lakṣmīdhra uses) and in later purāṇas like the *Kāśīkhāṇḍa* and the *Brahmavaivarta*, which the writers of the 16th century onward use, will show how this transposition was rapidly accomplished. Revelation of the merit of a hidden sanctuary is not limited to the remote past. An Indian Lourdes is still possible and a future Mitramiśra may utilise the literature of the miracles of our times[^218] near the gate of old Viśveśvarālaya.").Two influences have worked in this direction. Local patriotism exploits the ancient prejudice against making journeys to a distant *tirtha*[^219]."),and research discovers proximate holy places. The desire for symmetry and completeness works in the direction of "discovering" and bringing into use shrines founded by deities of the class till then unidentified. The Sun is worshipped at an ancient shrine named Lolārka near the confluence of the Asī, and even now an annual mela draws worshippers to a well near it[^220].Originally, the shrine was probably one of Śiva, and known as Lolārkeśvara. As the Sun is an Āditya, and their number is twelve, shrines of the other eleven appear now in the sacred catalogue of the *Kāśikhaṇḍa*[^221].Lakṣmīdhara (*inf*., p. 126) mentions, on the authority of the *Liṅgapurāṇa*, five Vināyakas

  It is probable that even when Lakṣmīdhara wrote many of the shrines mentioned by the Lingapurana could correctly located. He has himself made no attempt to fix their sites. Many of the lingas which he names were forgotten in the 17th century, and Mitramiśra omits several of them and relegates a large number to the end of his section on Kāśi. When Sherring wrote in 1868, he was told that at Kāśī, "Gaṇeśa is worshipped in fifty-six places, the goddess Yogini in sixty-four, Durga in nine, Bhairo (Bahirava) in eight, Šiva in eleven (the Ekādaśa Rudrāḥ?), Vișņu in one, and the Sun in twelve[^223], p. 47.")"His exhaustive researches enabled him to put the number of shrines or tīrthas at Kāśī at 1654 in his time. Thirty years earlier, James Prinsep put their number roughly at a thousand[^224].Laksmīdhara names less than three hundred and fifty.

**RESULTS OF A COMPARATIVE STUDY IN REGARD TO KASI**

   A comparative study of Lakṣmīdhara's treatise with those of his three chief successors, who lived between the 15th and 17th centuries, yields certain results. The name Kāśī seems to occur in the body of Lakṣmīdhara's book only once[^217], and when he speaks of it as a holy place he prefers to allude to it as Avimukta and Varāṇasī. In the verse which names Kāśī, Šiva, who is the speaker, distinguishes himself from the Lord of Avimukta (Avimukteśvara.) In later accounts, based on the Kāśikhaṇḍa, the chief shrine in Benares is declared to be that of Viśveśvara. Two etymologies are furnished for the name Avimukta; one from the Matsyapurana and the other from the Lingapurana. The second derivation makes out that the name was given to the city, as it was free of sin (avi). The other, which alone Lakşmīdhara cites, stresses the pledge of Siva never to abandon the city, and it is explained by the Kāśi-khanda as an allusion to an earlier retreat of Siva to

[^217]: "Infra, p. 67."



Mandāragiri. The force of the assertion is brought out by reference to Śiva as *sannihita*, ever present, at the *tīrtha*. Lakṣmīdhara himself uses the name Kāśī only in a "civil" or secular sense.

  The name *Ānandavana*, which occurs in the formulæ of all rites at Kāśī now-a-days, does not occur at all in the *Kalpataru*. The minimum baths prescribed now are in five places (*pañca-tīrtha*), and there is a prescribed order to be followed in going round the shrines.[^226]In Lakṣmīdhara's time the order was different, and the pilgrim took the route laid down by the*Liṅgapurāṇa*.[^227]

[^226]: "infra, pp. 121-3."

VISVESVARA

[^227]: "infra, pp. 17, 27, and 93."

  The most important shrine and *liṅga*, since at least the sixteenth century when Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭa induced Toḍarmāl to reconstruct the temple of Viśveśvara, (c. 1586 A.D.) which had been destroyed at least twice before his time, was that of Viśveśvara. In the twelfth century there was indeed a shrine of Višveśvara; but, judging from Lakṣmīdhara's allusions, it[^228]. (आवश्यकतीर्थानि).")was only one of many holy places in the sacred area, with no superior sanctity as compared with the others. This preeminence is given to the *svayambhū-liṅga* of Avimukteśvara, which had revealed itself by piercing its way through the ground (*inf*. p. 41). Of the three mentions of Viśveśvara in the *Kalpataru*, one (*inf*. p. 17) is probably an interpolation, as it occurs only in one manuscript, the second (*inf*. p. 27) merely refers to Śiva or Avimukteśvara descriptively as 'Lord of the Universe', and the third (*inf*. p. 93) makes it an ordinary *liṅga*, like hundreds of others, whose *darśana* confers a *lower* benefit than *mukti*. Viśveśvara had, however, come into prominence before the fifteenth century, when Vācaspati Miśra wrote, as he reconciled the new cult of Viśveśvara with the older of Avimukteśvara by identifying the two, as *both* were represented as the lords of Kāśī[^229].As the *Kāśikhaṇḍa*, (the

chief work that spread the Viśveśvara legends and pre-eminence in Kāśī), was popular enough to be translated into Telugu by Śrīnātha (c. 1440 A. D.), it is clear that by that time atleast the cult was well-established. By the middle of the sixteenth century the entire body of legends, including those relating to Kāśī as *Ānandakānana*, was accepted all over India, and the chapters on the *Ānandakānana-māhātmya* in the *Vāyupurāṇa* were translated into Telugu, by Liṅgamaguṇṭa Rāma Kavi, a son-in-law of the famous Telugu poet Tenāli Rāmayya. It is worthy of note that manuscript and printed versions of the *Kāśikhaṇḍa* are current in South India, which do *not* contain the *Pañcakrośī-māhātmya*, which occurs in Śrīnātha's free version of that section of the *Skandapurāṇa*, and that the text of the *Vāyupurāṇa* current in South India does *not* contain the section translated by Rāma Kavi[^230].

[^230]: "Information supplied by Pandit Vetūri Prabhākara Śāstri."

  Vācaspati's identification of Avimukteśvara with Viśvanātha is rejected by both Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭa and Mitramiśra[^231]. It is pointed out that the *Padmapurāṇa*, the *Kāśikhaṇḍa* and the *Brahmavaivarta* distinguish the two, and that the *Kāśikhaṇḍa* even refers to the worship of Avimukteśvara by Viśveśvara. The former is described as the 'ancient *liṅga*' (*Ādi-liṅga*). Both Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭa and Mitra Miśra regard the *svayambhū-liṅga* as that of Viśveśvara. They believe that it was desecrated and lost when the Muhammadans sacked Kāśī and destroyed its temples. A substitute for a selfrevealed *liṅga* is not ordinarily worshipped. But, as the new *liṅga* has been accepted by ś*iṣṭas*, *pūjā* may be done to it. Such is the conclusion of Mitramiśra[^232].It is more than doubt-

[^231]: "Tristhalisetu, p. 296; Tīrthaprakāśa, p. 189."

[^232]: "Tirthaprakāśa, p. 219. But he adds: दुर्दान्तम्लेच्छादिवशात् तत्र लिङ्गाभावे स्थानप्रदक्षिणेनैव नित्ययात्रा सिध्यति । स्नपनादिकं तु तदा निरधिष्ठानत्वात् निवर्तत इति शिष्टाः ॥  Mitramiśra follows Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭa who remarks;-"



ful if the present shrine of Viśvanātha stands on the site of that of the original Avimukteśvara or even of the less important Viśveśvara known to Lakṣmīdhara. It is worthy of remark that among the numerous grants of the Gāhadwālas, which were issued from Kāśī, and which specify the *kṣetra* at which the donor worshipped after bath, there is mention of Viśveśvara in only *one* grant, and that in a context which suggests that the name was used merely as a synonym for God.

  Other results of the comparative study may be briefly indicated. Maṇikarṇikā-kuṇḍa is mentioned, but not so as to suggest for it the high sanctity now attributed to it. (*inf*., pp. 103-121). Daśāśvamedha is mentioned both as a *tīrtha* at which a bath is enjoined (p. 237 *infra*, on the authority of the *Vāmanapurāṇa*) and as the shrine of a *liṅga* of the name (*inf*. 116). The now famous *via* *sacra* of Benares, the fifty miles long *Pañcakrośī* and the obligation to make its perambulation annually are not mentioned at all by Lakṣmīdhara. It is very probable that neither the "sacred way" nor its shrines were in existence even after the twelfth century, and there was for a long time after it no obligation to make its peregrination. A *tīrtha-pradak-ṣiṇa* is part of a pilgrimage, as the *tīrtha* is a divinity. There are those who attempt a circum-ambulation of all *tīrthas* (as was done by Caitanya and Rāmadāsa Samartha Svāmin in the 5th and 17th centuries). Where, as in Kāśī, numerous sacred pools and objects worship are crowded into a narrow area six miles by one and a half, a practice of making a circuit of them may have arisen and then crystallized into an obligation to do so by a prescribed route[^233].

  Some well-known objects of pilgrimage at Kāśī, deriving their authority from the *Kāśikhaṇḍa*, are conspicuous by their absence in the *Kalpataru*. Among them may be mentioned the *Mukti-maṇḍapa* from which *namaskāras* should be made[^234]the

  Suicide at Kāśī is recognised in the Purāṇas cited by Lakṣmidhara. It is by the usual means of starvation, drown- ing or self-cremation. The interdiction of such suicide as *kalivarjya* is not mentioned in this section of his digest. But, suicide is unnecessary at Kāsi, owing to a special power conferred on the *kṣetra.* Śiva himself ensures the *mukti* of *every* one who dies within the sacred limits by whispering into the right ear of the dying person a *mantra* which is appropriately called the *Tāraka*[^240]. The *mantra* is not given, nor is it purport explained in the work. It is usually described as the *Rāma- tāraka* on two grounds; firstly, because (according to legend) the direction to Śiva to whisper it to the dying person was given by Rāma, and secondly, because the *mantra* consists in the repetition of the name of Rāma[^241]. Another explanation of the mystic formula is that it implies only *Brahma-jñāna*. As no previous preparation for inititation into the *mantra* is imposed, and its application is universal and effect immediate and complete salvation, the belief in being helped over the ocean of rebirth, by its being whispered into one's dying ear by Śiva

[^240]: "inf. p. 17."

[^241]: "Tirthaprakaśa, pp. 2137-8. The mantra is “ओं श्री रामाय नमः । ओं श्री राम राम राम."



himself is an irresistible inducement for those who expect the approach of death to make Kāśī their home. This plenary indulgence is enjoyed by no other *tīrtha*. It is only at Kāśī that mere death grants release from rebirth. In the face of so wide a guarantee, it would seem unnecessary that one should go to all the other tedious preparations to secure the same end by baths, fasts, vows, sacrifices and prayers. That they also are recommended is due to the obvious need to provide different means of conviction to natures of varying moral and spiritual calibre. As the privilege is restricted to deaths *within* the holy area, the determination of its bounds becomes a necessity. This is done by the name of the city itself, *viz*., *Vārāṇasī,* the *enclave* between the Varaṇā(Barņā) and the Asī(or Śuṣkanadī, the dry stream[^242]).Few cities have changed their limits so little through the ages as Benares has done[^243] in length and about 6 lis (nearly a mile) in width. ").Its situation on a long, narrow ridge, forming a crescent within which the great river makes a wide sweep towards north, and provides deep water close to the northern bank, well above high-water mark has made its length greater than its width. Kāśi's location contributes to its beauty, especially as one first sees it on an approach from the southern shore. The magnificent river front, which is Kāśi's glory, makes one's first sight of it unforgettable. The great flights of steps, which lead down to the edge of the water, probably existed, more or less as at present, centuries ago, and the city was then, as now, filled with rest houses and free feeding places. This may be inferred from Lakṣmīdhara's allusion to the provision of such amenities for pilgrims which he had himself made as a mark of his piety and faith.

*Matsyodarī*

  Among the riddles which the *sthala-pur*ā*nas* offer in Kāśi one is the identity of the river *M*ā*tsyodarī,* to which three references occur in the extracts cited by Lakṣmīdhara. (*inf*. pp. 34, 58 and 69). In a striking metaphor, the *kṣetra* is compared to the human body, and three streams in the *kṣetra* to three *nāḍīs* of Indian anatomy. They are represented



as influenced by the gods Agni, Sūrya and Candra. At Prayāga the three streams, which make the *triveṇī*, are represented as the three *nāḍīs*, Piṅgalā (Yamunā), Iḍā (Gaṅgā) and Suṣumnā (Sarasvatī). As regards the streams of Kāśī the "dry stream" *i.e*., the Asī is Piṅgalānāḍi, Varaṇā is Idā-nāḍi and the Matsyodarī, which is between the two, is the Suṣumnā nāḍi (p. 34-5). On p. 58 a confluence of the Matsyodarīand the Ganges is stated as marking the spot at which a bath confers *mokṣa*. On p. 69 this river is described as one to which the gods resort, leaving their own abode (*devaloka*). In a passage from the *Kāśīkhaṇḍa* quoted by Mitramiśra (*op*. *cit*., p. 240) the Matsyodarīis described as ‛inner' and 'outer' (*bahir-antaścarā*), and as flowing into the Ganges against the current (*samhāra-mārga* i.e., *pratiloma*). It is therefore some ancient stream, which drained the ridge on which K*ā*śī stands and mingled its waters during the rains with those of the Ganges. In the days of Lakṣmīdhara it could apparently be distinguished from the main stream, while when, the *Kāśikhaṇḍa* was issued in its present form, it was supposed to flow under-ground or to be an under-current in the Ganges. How thoroughly its identity had been forgotten by the sixteenth century is shown by Nārāyaṇa Bhaṭṭa's forced interpretation of the name to show that the Ganges is the Matsyodarī. It was so named (he holds) as it lies in the womb of Käśī, which in shape is like a fish (*matsyākāra*). Mitramiśra accepts this explanation[^244].Another forced explanation, offered after the identity of the stream was lost, in the geographical changes that intervened, is that the Ganges is Matsyodarī because it has fish in its body[^245] !

**PRAYAGA**

  Compared to Kāśī, Prayāga enjoys a reputation which goes back to even earlier times. It stood at the confluence of two mighty rivers, each of which would command adoration from those who saw it rolling irresistably across the plains from its distant Him*ā*layan source, gathering volume from many affluents, and spreading fertility and life over the parched surface of the earth. Herein lay Pray*ā*ga's age-long appeal.



**INTRODUCTION**

 Like the Nile, whose two mighty branches are marked off fromeach other by the color of their floods, the Ganges and theNile could be seen as "white" and "dark" streams(*sitāita)*. Allahabad is like and unlike Khartoum. Two great riversmeet below it; but it is spiritualized by the idealism of acultured people, who have seen a divine purpose in the minglingof the waters. Such mighty unions have a compelling influenceon the human mind. Among a people who have an oppressivesense of a destiny, which ties them to an endless chain of birthand death, of joy and sorrow, a wistful feeling to find anoccasion to throw away life so that its sorrows might be ended for ever, comes naturally to every one who can feel and think. Sacrifices are easy for men whose lives reveal only a receding vista of unfulfilled hopes and repressed desires. Pilgrimages furnish opportunities for sacrifices, great and small: thesurrender of accustomed comforts and ease, the expenditure of accumulated wealth abandonment of one's native soil, and a decision to await death at a remote *tīrtha*, and even the laying down of life. To different minds different inducements to make the sacrifice are needed. A dweller in a desert isready to stake everything for the promise of post-mortuaryenjoyment of the pleasures denied to him in life. Pilgrim literature caters to high minds and to low. In this lies its wideinfluence. If life is to be laid down, one would like a noblesetting for the act of renunciation. He who essays the "greatjourney (*mahāprasthāna*) prefers to lose himself in theHimalayan snows. If the end must come through fire or water, where else could he find a more fitter place to meet hisdeath than where two mighty rivers mingle their floods, orwhere great streams lose themselves in the ocean?

 Countless generations have found the ideal conditions forsuch a culmination of a pilgrimage in Prayāga. The holy areaextended to five *yojanās*, along the spit of land which laybetween the two approaching streams. Gods must love toguard and cherish such a spot. It obviously is *Prajāpati-kṣetra*(p. 136). The Creator performed there a difficult (*prakṛṣṭa*) y*ā*ga, and hence its name *Pra-yāga[^246].*It is under the protection

[^246]: "Tīrthaprakāśa, p. 227. To describe other holy sites asPrayāga is incorrect, e.g., Karṇa-prayāga, Nanda-prayāga, whenthey were not places where similar great sacrifices were performedby the Creator."



**HAKĀṆḌA**

of Indra (p. 137). It marks the hip of the earth (*inf*. p. 142). It is sacred to the Sun(*Bhāskara-kṣetra*) and the Jumna is thedaughter of the Sun, *tapanasya sutā*, (*inf*. p. 149). In redeeming power the two rivers are equal, and their union adds to the power (p. 150). The Vedas and the invisible Yajñas dwellthere (p. 151). The great tree of the confluence, which neverdies (*akṣaya-vaṭa*), is Śiva himself (p. 151).

 Prayāga lay in the heart of Govindacandra's kingdom. Ageneration or two before him, a great king had ended his life,in its waters.[^247]Special value must therefore attach not only towhat Lakṣmīdhara says about it, but even to what he omits torepeat from recognized tradition and ritual. The confluence isusually spoken of as one of three rivers, the third river beingthe invisible Sarasvatī, and is referred to as Triveṇī. Mysticsignificance attaches to the union. The triple flood reflects the union of the elements of the redeeming Omkāra or *Praṇava*, each river standing for a syllable of it.[^248]This name and the storyof the appearance of Sarasvatī do not appear in the *Kalpataru-*Prayāga is described, following the *Matsya*, and *Brahma-purāṇas as Tīrtha-rāja*, a title further popularised by the *Kāśīkhaṇḍa.*[^249]Lakṣmīdhara does not use it. As the theory of the secret (*gupta*) presence of the Sarasvatīat the confluence is foundin the *Brahma Purāṇa*, which he often quotes, his silence issuggestive. He emphasizes the prohibition of the use of draughtanimals and conveyances in the journey to Prayāga, andit may be recollected that in his view the prohibition wasvalid only as regards this *tīrtha*.[^250] As usual Lakṣmīdharastresses the possession of moral qualities as necessary for deriving the full benefit of a bath at the confluence.[^251] NārāyaṇaBhaṭṭa and Mitramiśra discuss at length the pilgrim's obligation to undergo tonsure before a bath at the confluence.They hold that it is compulsory and that even women whosehusbands are alive, must cut off atleast a lock of hair and throwit into the Sangam, with an appropriate invocation to theVeṇi, which is to receive the *veṇi* (lock of hair)[^252].Lakṣmīdhara's

view that tonsure at a *tīrtha* has already been noted. He omitsto deal with it entirely in the context of Prayāga. His studiedsilence has to be construed as disapproval of the texts that consign to hell the pilgrim who fails to sacrifice his hair.^(**1**)

 Among *tīrthas* Prayāga is noted for being the place atwhich one is not only permitted but persuaded to commitsuicide. The Rg Veda *khila* authority for it (which is paraphrased in the Purāṇas) is not quoted by Lakṣmīdhara as it isby later writers.^(**2**) They discuss, with a great display of learning,the ethics of suicide at Prayāga, but he simply cites the authorityfor the act and offers no comment.^(**3**) The recollection of famousinstances suicide such as those Karṇadeva of Cedi (A.D. 1042),of Dhanga Chandella (A.D. 1000) and of Someśvara Cālukya(A.D. 1068)^(**4**)—all by drowning at either Prayāga or at asimilar river confluence^(**5—**)must have been fresh to his contemporaries. We may assume that suicide at Prayāga has hisapproval atleast for *kṣatriyas*, as it is *kalivaryya* only toBrāhmaṇas^(**6**.) The reward of suicide at the *saṅgama* is statedin one place to be equal to that of the wise, virtuous *yogin*(*inf.* p. 143), *i.e*., to *mukti*, and in another context as a longspell of existence in Svargaloka, enjoying the crude pleasuresof the senses (pp. 138-139) in the company of divine women,till the time comes to be re-born in a good family.

'delectable' destiny awaits the person, who remembers Prayāga at the moment of death (p. 139). Such a person, when reborn, becomes king of Jambūdvīpa. Hewho jumps from the sacred banyan tree (*vaṭa-vṛkṣa*) into the river below and so ends his life finds his way to Rudraloka[^253].") (p. 142).In some accounts the benefits of the two modes of suicide are interchanged. The number of suicides in Allahabad by jumping off this tree became so great, from a belief that Akbar had committed such suicide in a past birth and been rewarded by becoming an emperor in the next, that he had the tree cut down. Today only a stump is left. Similar post-mortuary advantages are held out for self-cremation on the sands near Prayāga, known as Ūrvaśīpuḷiṇa and in the continguous Koṭi-tīrtha. In ages where the common man was starved of sense pleasures, such appeals to the lower nature would have been even more powerful than inducements like the termination of re-incarnation.

[^253]: "Suicide from this tree was common already in the 7th century (Beal's Si-yu-ki, I, p. 232

 The virtues of the baths are graded. A month's regular bathing in the holy *Saṅgama*, following the path of restraint of the senses, washes away all sin (*inf*. p. 148). The imposition of a far sterner course for the betrayer of trust (*viśvāsaghātaka*) extending to three months, at the rate of three baths daily is a reflection of the horror of the betrayer. In the month of Māgha, bathing at Prayāga is most efficacious as an impossible number of *tīrthas* gather within the joint stream (p. 146). The *mela* in this month, and once every sixth and twelfth year, is an old institution, of which we have evidence in Yuwan Chwang in the 7th century[^254]It is not mentioned by Lakṣmīdhara, in whose time also it must have been current. The merits of gifts are great at Prayāga, and of gold, kine land, and *kanyā* there are highly commended, while the acceptance of gifts, except of a virgin for marriage according the ancient (ārṣa) form, and of land is reprobated with equal emphasis**³**.

**THE GANGES**

 The sanctity of the great river is the foundation of theimportance of every kşetra or *tīrtha* which springs on itsbanks. The Ganges has gained a grip over the heart of Indiawhich no other river has rivalled. In Indian belief its sources are in heaven and its waters penetrate to the nether regions. Itis therefore *tripatha-gā*, or *trivartma-gā* (p. 158). It nourishesthe denizens of the three worlds, heaven, earth and *pātāḷa*(p. 158). Its tender helpfulness to men is like that of amother (p. 159). It springs from the feet of Viṣṇu and hasbeen caught up in the matted locks of Śiva before being released to the world. It is thus twice sanctified, and equallyacceptable to those who see the one God only in Viṣṇu or Śiva.Offerings of water from its holy stream to the manes givesthem a satisfaction which is infinite (p. 157 and p. 161). It isthe holiest of the holy, the purest of the pure (p. 160). Itstands at the head of rivers as the Brāhmaṇa stands at thehead of the four *varṇas* (p. 158). Its mere *darśana* destroyssin (p. 156). Those countries are truly blessed through which theGanges passes (p. 154). To drink it, to see it, to feel it, to sinkone's body within its water and to chaunt its name and praiseare blessings (p. 159). Holy through-out its course, it is holier at Hardwār, Prayāga, Kāśi, and where it joins the ocean(p. 160). The Ganges is man's last refuge (*gati*) whentormented by afflictions, to which life is subject (p. 155).Without explanation or comment, Lakṣmīdhara gives in afew choice extracts the secret of the age-long lure of India'sgreatest life-giving stream[^255].

[^255]: "See also Tīrthaprakāśa, pp. 355-375 and Tīrthacintāmaṇi,pp. 189-268."

**GAYA**

 Gayā forms the third of the trinity, regarded as the "three*kṣetras* par excellance", the other two being Prayāga and Kāśi.Gaṅgā is a *pitṛ-nadī*, Gayā is a *pitṛ-tīrtha*. In other *tīrthas*bathing comes first in importance, and the performance of propitiatory rites to the manes is only incidental. In Gaya the relation is reversed. Gayā's chief merit is the potency of a*śrāddha* performed within its bounds, in accordance with modifications made in the ordinary *śrāddha* ritual to suit the *geniusloci.* Gayā as a *śrāddha-*performing place has great antiquity.Its value for this purpose is recognised in the *Mahābhārata*, in



which it is commemorated in every one the *tīrtha-yātrās*(Dhaumya, Pulastya, Aṅgiras, Lomaśa and Balarāma) whoseitinerary is furnished in the epic. The similar *yātrā* of Prahlāda, which is described in the *Vāmana-purāṇa*, deals also withit. Unlike other *tīrthas*, Gayā receives commemoration in the*smṛtis*: and Viṣṇu, Vasiṣṭha, Bṛhaspati, Yājñavalkya andYama laud the virtues of the *Śrāddha* done at Gayā.

  Gayā lies on the fringe of the area of Aryan occupation,and its recognition as a *tīrtha* must have implied a big step forward. The legend of the *asura* at Gayā, who was killed by themace (*gadā*) of Viṣṇu, and who, in return, was given the boonof sanctifying any holy rite performed on his decapitated head (which is Gayā) points perhaps to an ancient compromise between competing cultures. *Śrāddha* is ancestor worship. It iscommoner in primitive than in advanced communities. But,when it became invested with a special importance in relation to the theory of man's birth in a tri-form debt, and his obligation to discharge it, *śrāddhas* came to have a prominent place in the routine of Indian life, which it was the business of theDharmaśāstras to regulate. They accordingly have a largeplace in the *Gṛhyasūtras*, smṛtis and digests, all of which laydown the times for performance, the rules to be observed, thepersons to be invited and excluded, the ancestors to be propitiated, proper places for doing them, the food to be served atthem etc. No digest is complete without a section on it. One of the larger sections of the *Kṛtya-kalpataru* is set apart for the*śrāddha.* Lakṣmīdhara omits to describe it in relation not onlyto ordinary *tīrthas* but even in regard to Gayā. While it isunncessary to describe the ordinary *śrāddha* rites, it may behelpful to note certain special features of the *Gayā-śrāddha,*indicated by other writers,[^256]

  The only inhibition against its performance is that it cannot be done within a year of the death of parents. All times,including those which are *varjya* (inadmissible) for sacred orsecular rites, are open to its performance at Gayā[^257]**.**

muttered at it.[^259]The Brāhmaṇas to be invited at Gayā for*śrāddhas* are those of Gayā, who claim to be descended fromthose who grumbled about the fees given to them by Brahmā,when he performed a *yāga* there, were cursed by him, and subsequently, on their penitence were forgiven and given the privilege of officiating at all *śrāddhas* at Gayā.^(**2**) After the lapseof one year from their death, *patitas* may have *śrāddhas* performed for their benefit at Gayā. So too suicides, those who have met with death from violence, poisoners, atheists, thoseguilty of arson, adulterers slain by the injured husbands, thosewho practise unnatural sex offences and associates of caṇḍālas[^260]

[^260]: "Tīrthaprakāśa, p. 452."

  Among writers on tirtha, Vācaspatimiśra deals more fullywith Gayā than others. The *Tīrthacintāmaṇi*, like the *Tīrtha-prakāśā*, has absorbed the entire section from Lakṣmīdhara'swork and reproduced it *verbatim* (*op. cit. 268-280*). The respect that Vācaspati and Mitramiśra held Lakṣmidhara's workin is evident from his placing the *Kalpataru* with the Vāyu andGāruḍa Purāṇas among his authorities[^261].

[^261]: " e.g., Tīrthacintamaṇi, p. 268."

 Lakṣmīdhara gives the Purāṇic grounds for performing*śrāddhas* at Gayā by retailing the legend of king Viśāla, whobegot a son only after he performed a *śrāddhas* at Gayā tosatisfy his manes. He saw at the ceremony three apparitions, each a king of a different color, white, red and black. Whenquestioned, the white spirit replied that he was Viśāla's father,white because of his virtuous life, while for different degreesof turpitude his own father and grandfather, who had been recalled from Hell by the *śrāddha* were stained by their crimes.All of them went to heaven, as the result of the *śrāddha.* Thevirtue of Gayā makes a śrāddha done there release from perdition ancestors sentenced to it for evil living. It gives sons to the childless. Another legend describes another virtue of Gayā:

**———————————————————————**  

2\. The legend is given in Agnipurāṇa. Brahma's boon wasthis:

*ये युष्मान् पूजयिष्यन्ति गयायामागता नराः ।  
हव्यकव्यैर्धनैः श्राद्धैस्तेषां कुलशतं व्रजेत् ।  
नरकात् स्वर्गलोकं च स्वर्गलोकात् परां गतिम्॥*

Lakṣmīdhara is silent on the alleged monopoly.



release from *Preta-loka* of those for whose sake a piṇḍa isoffered there. One who bathes in at Kanakhala near Gayā goto heaven. He who makes a circuit of the *yūpa* (sacrificialpost) of Brahmā's *yāga* at Gayā obtains the puṇya arisingfrom a Vājapeya sacrifice *i.e.,* he is released from the sin ofBrahmahatyā. The presiding deity of Gayā is 'Viṣṇu with theMace', *Gadādhara*, who simultaneously removed an *asura*, andprovided a means of releasing ancestral spirits by *śrāddhas* performed at Gayā-*śiras*, the *asura's* head, which became the holyground known as Gayā.

  The worship of tree spirits is widespread.Great trees are the homes of spirits or are incarnated gods[^262].They meritworship. They attract ancestral spirits, and piṇḍas offeredin their shade, are specially relished by the manes, as thoselaid at the feet of Viṣṇu (*Viṣṇupāda*). The funereal ritual atGayā includes the placing of *piṇḍas* under "the undying tree" (*Akṣaya-vaṭa*) and on Viṣṇupāda, over which a special shrinehas arisen. It is curious that while Viṣṇu as Gadādhara is thedeity of Gayā, the Purāṇas allude to shrines of Gopati (Kṛṣṇa)and Janārdana there[^263].The local holy spots recall the association of Brahmā with Gayā (*e.g.*, Brahmayoni, Brahmasaras).

[^262]: "The great tree at Prayāga is Śiva; inf. p. 151- महेश्वरो वटो भूत्वा तिष्ठते परमेश्वरः ।"

[^263]: "infra. p. 172 and p. 173."

  The full cycle of ceremonies to be done at Gayā is said torequire seven days[^264]. Lakṣmīdhara is content indicate only theneed to do *śrāddhas* at Gayā, offer *piṇḍas* to manes, perform*pitṛ-tarpaṇa*, and bathe in the springs of the Phalgu river, whichmust always have been dry, except in the rains, judging fromBrahmā's curse.In Govindacandra's time, Gayā had comewithin the kingdom of Kanauj. It is improbable that Lakṣmīdhara lacked personal knowledge of Gaya and its local traditions and customs or of its treatment in the Purāṇas, whichwere then in repute. When he omits to mention rules now invogue, it is not unsafe to presume that either they came intoeffect after his time, or that he rejected their validity and declined to notice them in a work of authority.

**OTHER TIRTHAS**

 Vācaspati Miśra has only one more *tīrtha* to deal with, *viz.*,Puruṣottama (Puri) in Orissa to which he devotes a third ofhis book. He deals less fully with three other *tīrthas* of Utkala,*viz.*, Kṛttivāsas (Bhuvaneśvara or Ekāmrakṣetra), Virajā andand Koṇārka (Konarak). These were apparently his favoriteholy shrines, and he deals scrappily with Prayāga. NārāyaṇaBhaṭṭa had an even more restricted scope. For the other*tīrthas*, our main guide, outside the *Kalpataru*, is Mitramišra,who absorbs almost all that Lakṣmīdhara has written andadded to it here and there. Even Lakṣmīdhara's treatmentbecomes perfunctory. He devotes a chapter each, some conisting of hardly more than a page, to seventeen *tīrthas*, and has asupplementary chapter, which gallops over the names of over ahundred, which to him may have been mere names. Even then,his treatise contains glaring omissions, especially of *tīrthas*in distant regions of which he had no knowledge, and to whichperhaps pilgrimage from North India was then an impossibility.The Godāvarī and *Setu-bandha* would not have been omitted,in a well-proportioned work, nor rivers like the Tuṅgabhadrā,Kāverī and Tāmraparṇī, which are mere names in the *Kalpataru*. An extract from Matsyapurāṇa (*inf.* p. 204) bring the Kāverīwithin the section dealing with Narmadā-*tīrthas* and immediately after Amarakaṇṭaka! His attitude is explicable.When he wrote of Kāśī, he did so not only from books butfrom close personal knowledge. Such intimacy is not displayedin regard to other kṣetras or tīrthas even within the dominionsof the king, whom he served as chief minister.It seems verydoubtful whether he had made the pilgrimage to Himālayan*tīrthas* like Badari, Kedāra and Lohārgala, which he describesas situated in *mleccha-deśa*, *i.e.*, in an area under Muhammadanoccupation (*inf*. p. 288). He has simply reproduced extractsfrom the Purāṇas about them. It is also not likely that he hadvisited Gujarat and the regions of the Narmadā as well asMālwa and Rajputāna. His accounts of Puṣkara, Ujjainīand Amarakaṇṭaka betray no personal acquaintance. Neitherthe tradition of Brahmā's *yāga* at Puṣkara nor of the lake being*Tīrtha-Nārāyaṇa* seem to have been known to him. He certainlyknew Mathurā and its neighbourhood, probably had visitedHardwār (which he calls Kubjāmraka) and the country drainedby the ancient Sarasvatī, *viz.*, Kurukṣetra and Pṛthudaka. The*tīrthas* of Madhydeśa, like Naimiśa, Sūkara, Gopratāra



(p. 235) and Stutasvāmī, which must have been in the presentUnited Provinces as it is said to be only three miles fromDhūtapāpā, *i.e.*, Dhopāp, in Oudh. The exact location of some*tīrthas* to which he has given the distinction of separatechapters, is difficult to determine. Is Kokāmukha, a *kṣetra*dedicated to Viṣṇu as Varāha, or the *Triveṇī* in Bengal? Whereis Mandāra he describes? (p. 21 & 8). The Mandāra of theMahābhārata seems to be a hill in Garhwāl, in the Himālayanregion, but Lakṣmīdhara's description would suit Mandāragiri(p. 218) in Bhagalpur District. The family deity of theGāhdawālas was Varāha (Viṣṇu). It may explain the choiceof two Varāha-tirthas like Sūkara and Kokāmukha. They probably were patronised by the Gāhadwālas.

  The air of unreality which clings to his accounts of eventhe more famous *tīrthas*, in the concluding pages of his treatise,is evident in the scantiness of the information that his extractsgive. To live in Kurukṣetra (*Brahmāvarta,* as it was north ofthe Dṛṣadvati and south of the Sarasvatī[^265]) and to bathe duringeclipses in the tank at Kurukṣetra are all that one may gatherof one of the most celebrated places in India at which the *Gītā*was revealed, the Great War was fought, and Brahmā performed a *yajña*, from a writer who has commemorated everytiny shrine in crowded Kāśī. Of Pṛthūdaka we are told thatit was sacred to Kārtikeya and was the most important ofthe sub-*tīrthas* of the Sarasvatī[^266]. Of Puṣkara, in the omissionof much that could have been written of so famous a *tīrtha*, anintriguing statement is made, which brings it into line withKāśī, that it was open even to Cāṇḍālas. A man of any castewho goes to Puṣkara is equal to a *dvija*[^267].A comment on theJumna (p. 187) limits the holy places on it to the area betweenMathurā and Prayāga. An unedifying legend is all that isto be said of the Mahākāla-kṣetra at Ujjain, dear to Kālidāsa[^268] (*inf.* p. 196).Two statements regarding the Narmadā, whichunlike Gangā, is solely dedicated to Śiva, and therefore dear tohis devotees, are noteworthy: it is holy (as the Ganges is)throughout its length; and it confers its benefits even on thosewho merely see it (p. 197). Suicide by fire and by falling from

[^266]: " infra, p. 178."

[^267]: "infra, p. 180."

[^268]: "infra, p. 185. Meghadūta, 1, 38."



the cliff of Amarakaṇṭaka is noticed (p. 200). Hardwār(Māyāpurī) is one of the traditional seven cities of India[^269].^()The *Tīrthasudhānidhi*, which attempts to treat the seven, beginswith it. Its identity will hardly be realized by a perusal of thechapter on Kubjāmraka (near Hṛṣikeśa) which deals with theregion (p. 206).

[^269]: "अयोध्या मथुरा माया काशी काञ्ची अवन्तिका ।   पुरी द्वारवती चैव सतैता मोक्षदायिकाः ॥"

  The long penultimate chapter is devoted to miscellaneous*tīrthas*, but it contains some interesting matter. Mitramiśra'swork has a similar chapter, but it is feeble in comparison withthat of Lakṣmīdhara. Gopratāra on the Sarayū is described(p. 235), as well as *tīrthas* in Orissa and the Dakhan.Thetimes when particular tīrthas are most propitious are noted(pp. 201-243 and 248-249). The forests in which death iswelcome are named (p. 244). A long extract gives the namesof sixty-eight shrines of Viṣṇu all over India. Mitramiśra, whocopies this chapter, as he does others, omits this passage(p. 609) with the remark that it indicates the manner ofmaking a round of "the earth" (*pṛthvī-pradakṣiṇa-vidhi*). The*Mahābhārata* (*Pulastya-tīrtha-yātrā*) ascribes to a clockwiseround of the tīrthas of India the effects of a horse-sacrifice.The interpretation given to the citation of the passage is nothowever justified by a perusal of its contents as the *tīrthas* arenot named in any proper order. They are mentioned in ahaphazard way. Thus after the Tungabhadrā comes, Kurukṣetra, Manikuṇḍa (?), Ayodhyā, Kuṇḍina (in Berar), etc.,(p. 252). The spirit by which Lakṣmīdhara would animate thetrue pilgrim is indicated in the declaration that "he attains *mukti*who sees the Supreme Spirit (*i.e*., God) wherever he goes."

  An intriguing extract which concludes the chapter onmiscellaneous *tīrthas* describes the sanctity of a *kṣetra* calledĀmalaka in the Sahya, and its *tīrthas.* It seems to refer to afomous Viṣṇu temple of Malabar[^270].The extract is from the*Narasiṁhapurāṇa*, which Lakṣmīdhara cites in this as well as inother sections of the *Kalpataru*. When he shows so littleknowledge of the geography and the *tīrthas* of the Dakhan, how

[^270]: "Tirunelli in Wynad, Malabar. See Logan's MalabarManual, I, p. 190. Tirunelli means Śrī-Āmalaka"



did he choose the extract in question? The *upa-purāṇa* may besimply following in the wake of *Śrī Bhāgavata-purāṇa* (whichLakṣīmdhara does not seem to citeanywhere) in referring tothe sanctity of places and persons in South India.The selection of the passage by Lakṣmīdhara for inclusion in his digestmay be simply an indication of his love of completeness.

MAHĀPATHA-YATRĀ

  The book ends with a chapter on "the great trek" whichends in meeting death, instead of waiting for its approach. Itmight seem grotesque to include *Mahāprasthāna in tīrtha-yātrā.*Its inner significance will be recognized by the reader who looksbelow the surface and sees in a tīrtha only a means of *crossing*(*taraṇa*) the gulf of *samsāra* in the advance towards *mukti*.He will find the logic of the last journey with the same endbeing itself looked upon as a *tīrtha*. It marks the culminationof a scheme of pilgrimage, whose goal lies beyond all physicalmeans of redemption and beyond life itself.

*  Mahā-patha* "the great road" is the euphemistic name fordeath, and accordingly to call a road *mahā-patha* during ajourney is forbidden, as it is inauspicious[^271].In the same way, sleep must not be qualified by the use of the word *"mahat"* asit would mean death. The road to death is wide because everyone must tread it. Death is inevitable. One might wait for itsapproach or advance to meet it half-way. He who awaits theslow approach of death might do so bravely or might be filledwith dread; but he who sets out to meet death can not lackcourage. Death has no terrors to a righteous man, or one whobelieves that it only opens the way to a higber life. The aim ofpilgrimage is to secure post-mortuary benefits, and either anexistence free of the misery, which is the lot of man, orfreedom from rebirth, *mokṣa*. It is also the aim of suicide inappointed ways (*vaidheya-ātmaghāta*). There may be justification therefore in bringing the latter in the category of *yātrā*,and the means adopted to secure the end, namely death, maybe regarded as tīrtha. It is noteworthy that Lakṣmīdhara alonehas yielded to the logic. Mitramiśra treats of the subject in ahalf-hearted way. Others omit it altogether, possibty to escapean inauspicious ending of their books.

[^271]: "Vide Śabdakalpadruma, ‘Mahāpatha'."

  The *Mahābhārata* counsels one who has realized the transitoriness of life (*adhruvam jīvitam jñātvā*) to end it in the



Himālayas. The same advice is given by the *Brahmapurāṇa*,with a side-glance to the story of the Pāṇḍava brethren andDraupadī having attempted in the last journey to scale theheaven of Indra[^272].He who is unable to make this journey toIndra-loka should give up his life in the snows. When he doesso, firmly rooted in truth and courage, his death immediatelyleads him to heaven (p. 258). The Śaiva Purāṇas advocatesuicide by fire, or falling from the top of a mountain-cliff, byone imbued with devotion to Śiva, for obtaining for thesuccessful suicide a post-mortuary existence of unalloyedsensual pleasure (p. 362). A form of suicide that is recommended by them is to a build up great fire, and after worshipping a picture of Bhairava, offer oneself as a sacrifice in thatfire (*śivānale kṣipet kāyam*, p. 262). The special featureof this form of approach to heaven is its availablity to sinnersas well as to virtuous men, to women as to men, to men of theregenerate castes as to men of no caste whatever, *i.e*., theoutcastes (p. 262). The sorrow of a sinner for his morallapses must be as intense as his faith in this form of redemption, if he is led to select it. The spread of such beliefs wasapparently helped by the anarchy engendered by the fall ofgreat empires and the invasions of peoples hostile to Hinduism.

[^272]: "The last parva of the Mahābhārata is named Svargārohaṇa."

  The work concludes with a passage which offers theheavens of the Sun, Brahmā, Śiva and Viṣṇu to righteous kingswho lose their lives in defence of their kingdoms, and to thosewho are killed by fire or lightning, or by elephants or tigersor lions. As one who finds death by infuriated animals, whichare teased or provoked, is a *mahāpātakin*, the privilege must beunderstood as available only to those who meet such deathsaccidentally or in war or in the chase. A hope of such benefitsafter death should have been heartening to the kings of theRājput clans.



**CONCLUSION**



 So ends Lakṣmīdhara's treatise on pilgrimage. The way inwhich the subject has been treated by him indicates two things:firstly, the almost universal recognition of *tīrtha-yātrā* as apopular way to redemption; and secondly, the need to guardagainst the spread of a tendency to a mechanical, un-ethical andun-spiritual conception of pilgrimage, which would make it an



easily available expiation for the timorous, weak-minded andsuperstitious. They can see in it only a means of compoundingfor sins, without the need for a change of life or heart.Neither of these is in harmony with Dharma. Easy absolution isa moral solvent, and it is specially so when obtained by economicor physical means. New scenes, improved health, and wideningexperience of men and manners are results of travel, but in aproper conception of pilgrimage they should be viewed asadventitious. Some authorities, and especially the Purāṇas,had popularised *tīrtha-yātrā* by the promise of benefits thatcould not be regarded as worthy. Their trend had to becorrected by a comprehensive review of *tīrtha-yātrā* in theIndian scheme of life. Pilgrimage had come to stay. Itspopularity was on the increase. It was not statesmanship toarrest it. Its advantages to state and society were undeniable.In ages of political fission and the multiplication of kingdomswith unstable borders and foundations, the stream of pilgrims,which meandered unhindered through the length and breadthof India, helped to bring about economic and social interdependence, unification of culture, and a way to political co-operation,especially when Indian society and religion were threatened byenemies of alien race and a hostile faith. To leave pilgrimageto develope into a soul-killing, mechanical device for givingharassed men and women a mental anodyne, was not right.The concept of *tīrtha-yātrā* had to be sublimated, and its ethicaland spiritual tone raised. The emotions which inspired apilgrimage were not to be repressed. They had to be transfusedwith high aims, and then canalised. It was not enough forkings and leaders of society to provide for the safety ofpilgrims and for their conveniences, as tasks set by politicalduty or piety. To stress ethical and spiritual constituents, todistinguish between its spirit and form, and to bring pilgrimageinto relation with a comprehensive view of life and the hereafter were tasks for exponents of Dharma. If all Dharma is inone sense the obligation of the heads of society, *i.e., Rājadharma*, the enunciation of the principles of *tīrtha-yātrā* waswithin its ambit. In his recognition of this truth must be soughtthe purpose of Lakṣmīdhara, when he treated pilgrimage as a*major* topic in his comprehensive exposition of Dharma, andapplied his acute mind and massive learning to *tīrtha-vivecana.*

**APPENDIX E**  

TOPOGRAPHICAL NOTES.

 (The names of places of rivers or mountains, which have remained unchanged, and are easy to identify are omitted. The figures in brackets after the names refer to the pages in which mention of the *tīrthas* concerned occurs. The names are arranged in the order of the *Nāgarī* alphabet)

*Ayodhyā*, modern Ajodhya near Faizabad, Oudh.

*Amalakā* (224) a river near the Stuta-svāmi-kṣetra, in the United Provinces.

*Amarakaṇṭaka* (240). The source of the rivers Sone and Narbuda in the Mikul (Mekdalā) hills in Gondwāna, Central Provinces.

*Amareśvara* (236) on the Narbuda (Narmadā), on the bank opposite Omkārnāth. Thirty-two miles from Khandwa, G. I. P. Ry.

*Arjunīyā* (249) or *Bāhūdā* a feeder of the Rapti in Oudh. Now named Dhumela.

*Aruṇā-saṅgama* (238). The *Aruṇā*is a small affluent of the Sarasvatī, which joined it near *Pṛthūdaka* (Pehoa). It is lauded by *Bṛhaspatismṛti* as "world-famous *(lokaviśruta),*see p, 379. Cunningham (A. S. R.. xiv, 102) identifies the Aruṇā river with the Mārkanda.

*Arbuda,* (253) Mount Abu.

*Alakanandā* (169) a tributary of the Ganges made up of the *Viṣṇu Gaṅg*ā and *Sarasvatī-Gaṇgā.*

*Avantī*(195) used for both Ujjain and the area in which Ujjain is situated.

*Aśvatīrtha* (237) near Kanauj at the confluence of the Ganges and the *Kāli-nadī (Ikṣumatī).*

*Āmalaka-grāma* or *Sahya-Āmalaka-grāma* (254-255). Probably Tirunelli in Malabar.

*Ujjānaka* (247) Nando Lal Dey takes it to be *Udyānaka* in Kāfiristān (p. 211), on the Indus.

*Ujjainī* (195-57), Ujjain.

*Uttara-Mānasa* (248) the reach of the river Phalgu upto Gayā (N. L. Dey, *op. cit*. p. 156).

*Ṛṣabha-parvata* (251) a Viṣṇu-kṣetra in South India, probably the Alagar Hill temple near Madura,



*  Airāvatī* (249), the Rāpti in Oudh or the Ravi in the Punjab. Both will suit the context.

*  Kanakhala* (168, 239, 255), the place where Dakşa-yāga was performed. Two miles east of Hardw*ā*r at the junction of the Ganges and the Nīladhārā.

*  Kanya-tīrtha or Kanyā-kūpa* (246) a fountain in Kurukṣetra. Mr. S. Subba Row's identification of it with Cape Comorin *(Kanyā-kumārī)* is against its North Indian context. See his Index to the Kumbakonam ed. of the *Māhabhārata,* p. 35.

*  Kapilā* (201) the upper-most reach of the Narmadā (Narbuda) near its source in a *kuṇda.*

*  Karavīra* (207) on the *Dṛṣadvati,* the chief town of *Brahmāvarta* ; not to be identified with the other Karavīra (Kolhapur.)

*  Kāmarūpa* (239), Assam. The reference is probably to the shrine of *Kāmākhyā-devī*, at Kāmākhyā, two miles from modern Gauhati.

*  Kālañjara* (244) or *Ravikṣetra* modern Kalinjar, in Bundelkhand. Formerly capital of Jejakabhukti. Site of *Koṭi-tīrtha.*

*  Kāverī,* (241.249) the well-known South Indian river Kāverī (Cauvery). The allusion to the worship of Viṣṇu lying on Adiśeṣa *(nāga-śāyinam)* seems to be to the ancient temple of Ranganātha at Śrīrangam, near Trichinopoly.

*  Kāverīsangama* (204), the mouth of the K*ā*verīat K*ā*veripaṭņam near M*ā*yavaram.

*  Kubjāmraka* (296-208). Lakṣmīdhara treats it as synonymous with M*ā*y*ā*puri or Hardw*ā*r. Kūrma-purāṇa identifies it with Kanakhala, the site of *Dakṣayāga,* two miles from Hard-w*ā*r. It was the traditional hermitage of Raibhya.

*  Kuṇḍina* (252, 209), capital of ancient Vidarbha, now identified with Bidar in the Nizam's Dominions. (N. L. Dey, op. *cit.*p. 108). Kuṇḍapura, forty miles east of Amraoti in Berar, and Devalvarā in the Caṇḍa district of the Central Provincesare other sītes identified with this ancient city (A. S. R. x, p. 108).

*  Kuru-jāṅgala* or *Kuru-jāṅgalāraṇya* (244)— The jungle tract north of Hastin*ā*pura, the modern district of Sirhind. Both Hastin*ā*pura, the capital of the Kurus, and Thanesar (Sth*ā*neśvara) are in this area.

*  Kurukṣetra* (175-179). The area between the Dṛṣadvatī and Sarasvatī, the holiest area in India.

  Ked*ā*ra (230, 250), modern Ked*ā*rn*ā*th at the confluence of the Mand*ā*kinīand Dūdha-Gaṅg*ā*. It is a self-revealed



(*svayam-vyakta*) kṣetra of Śiva. It is the traditional place of the passing away of Śaṅkarācārya.

  *Kokāmukha* (213-214) or Varāha-kṣetra on the *Triveṇi* above Nāthpūr, in the Pūrnea district, Bengal, where the three Kosis unite their waters. See *in.* p. 251 also. The area in which it stands was probably among the conquests of Govindacandra, the patron of Lakṣmīdhara.

  Kuśastamba (246) probably Kuśasthala *i.e.* Kanauj, the capital of the Gāhadvāla dynasty.

  *Kuśāvarta* (245). A kṣetra near Hardwār. There is a Kuśāvarta in the Dakhan, *viz.* Nāsik, but it does not suit context, though it is more famous.

  *Koṭi-tirtha* (237) in Kurukṣetra.

 * Gaṅgā-sāgara,* the mouth of the Ganges near Saugor island. Kapilāśrama is on the island. (250)

  *Gandhamādana* (252), the part of the Himalayan range in which Badarināth is situated.

  *Gokarṇa* (241) refers to a shrine in Kāsīand not to any of the other three Gokarṇas. Bhadrakarṇa, and Suvarṇākṣa which are referred to along with Gokarṇa are shrines of Benares. The Himālayan Gokarṇa at which Bhagīratha performed austerities is referred to in the *R*ā*m*ā*yana*, Bālakāṇḍa, 42, 13.

 * Girivraja* (144), modern Rājgir, ancient Rājagṛha, the earlier capital of Magadha.

  *Gopratāra* (234), Guptāra in Fyzabad, Oudh, where Rāma passed away. (*Rāmāyaṇa,* VII 110)

  *Gomatī*(238, 241), the Gumti in Oudh.

 * Cakratīrtha* (252) from the context is the tīrtha in Kurukṣetra at which Śrī Kṛṣṇa tried to destroy Bhīṣma with his discus *(Cakra)*

  *Candrabhāga,* (243, 242, 249). Both the Chenāb in the Panjab, and the Bhīmā (a tributary of the Kṛṣṇāin the Dakhan are known by this name. In the context of p. 241, where other Dakhan rivers are mentioned in the same śloka, the Bhīmā seems to be referred to, while in the other two pages, the allusion is to the Chenāb.

  *Carmiṇā* (254), perhpas the same as Carmaṇvatībelow.

 * CarmaṇvatĪ*(250), the Chambal of Rājputāna, the chief tributary of the Jumna.

  *Citrakūṭa* (251), the lone hill on the *Mand*ā*kinī* or *Payasvinī* (Paisuni), where Śrī Rāma lived; now known as Kamptanāthgiri; in Buṇḍelkhand, four miles from the railway station, Chitrakut, G. I. P. railway.



  *Campakāraṇya* (168) or *Campakavana* mentioned as one of the *upatīrthas* of Gayā, may also be Camparan in the Patna division, Bihar.

  *Janasthāna* (246), the area of the Dakhan between the rivers Godāvarī and the Kṛṣṇā. Pargiter (J. R. A. S., 1894, p. 247) considers it to extend to the country both north and south of the Godāvarī near its junction with the *Prāṇahitā*(Waingaṅgā). See *Rāmāyaṇa,* III. 21, ff.

  *Jambūmārga* (250), is identified with Kalañjar by H. H. Wilson, note to *Viṣṇupurāṇa,* Trn., II, xiii. But, in the context in which the name occurs in the text,Kālañjara is mentioned along with Jambūmārga. The reference must be therefore to the other kṣetra of the name between Puṣkar and Mt. Abu.

  *Tāpī, Tāpikā* (242, 254), the river Tāpī on which Surat stands.

  *Tāmraparṇī* the river still known as such in Tinnevelly district, South India.

  Toṣalaka (253), perhaps Toṣalī, of Aśoka, mentioned in the Dhauli edict. It was one of his provincial capitals, and was probably in Goṇḍwāna.

  *Tuṅgā, Tuṅgabhadrā,* (252, 254) the river of the name in South India which separates the Madras presidency

from the Nizam's dominions. Tributary of the Kṛṣṇā; formed by the junction of the *Tuṅgā*and *Bhadrā*Kuḍli, above Harihar. The name *Tuṅgā* is applied to the united river.

  *Trikūṭa* (252), Jumnottari, the source of the Jumna.

  *Daṇḍaka, Daṇḍakāraṇya* (253, 2544), refers according to Pargiter (J. R. A. S., 1894). p. 242) to the entire forest area from Bundelkhand to the Kṛṣṇā river in the Dakhan.

  *Daśārṇa* (244), "ten forts," Bhopal and Eastern Malwa, whose capital was Vidiśā (Bhilsa).

  *Dāruvana* (239) same as *Devadāruvana* below.

  *Devadāruvana* (252), Aundh in the Nizam's Dominions. There is another *Devadāruvana,* the Himalayan region in which Badarināth is situated, but the southern tract seems suggested by the next reference in the same half-śloka being to Śrīraṅgam on the Kāverī. But the southern Dāruvana is a Śivakṣetra, whereas the allusion in the text is to a Viṣṇu shrine in Dāruvana. Ś*ivapuraṇa,* I, 56, places Dāruvana (the Śaivite) near the Western Ocean.

  *Devaparvata* (250) seems to refer to the Aravalli Hills.

 *Devika* (242), another name for the Ś*arayū* or Goghrāin the United Provinces, but a smaller river distinct from the S*arayū* and running between that river and the Gomatī(Gumti) is



referred to by the *Kālikā-purāṇa,* ch. 23. The reference on p. 245 in the passage from the *Māhabhārata* suggests a big river like the Sarayū.

  *Dvārakā,* modern Dwarka, in Gujarat, ŚrīKṛṣṇa's capital. (225-227).

  *Dvīpa* (251) where Viṣṇu as Kapila and Ananta is said to be worshipped is obviously Saugor island at the mouth of the Ganges, which is identified with *Kdpilāśrama.* See *Gaṅgāsāgara-saṅgama,* supra.

  *Dharmāraṇya* (247) from the context indicates some forest *kṣetra* in Gujarat, though the mention of *Brahmasaras* next may make it an allusion to the upa-tīrtha in Gayā, known as *Dharma-tīrtha* (inf. p. 266).

  *Dṛṣadvatī (*252), which, according to *Manusmṛti,* II, 17, is one of the boundaries of *Brahmāvarta* is very probably the river Chitāng, which runs parallel to the *Sarasvatī*(J. R. A. S., 1893, p. 58).

  *Dhūtapāpā* (223) is Dhopāp on the Gumti, some miles south of Sultānpūr in Oudh.

  *Narmadā* (198-205, 241, 243), the great river Narbuda.



** *Nandāvarī* (249) is the *Mahānandā i*n the U. P., which runs east of the Kuśī(*Kauśiki*) with which it is mentioned in the text.

  *Payoṣṇī* (254), the river *Pain-gaṅgā*in the Central Provinces, which flows into the Varadāor Wārdhā.

  *Parṇāsā* (249), the river Banās in Rājputāna.

 *Pāriyātra-giri* (235), usually taken as referring loosely to the Arvalli mountains in Rajputāna and the western parts of the Vindhyan range. But the context in which it is mentioned indicates an isolated hill in South India.

  *Piṇḍāraka* (247), the place where Sāmba was cursed by the sages, sixteen miles from Dwārka,

  *Puṇḍarīkā* (208) is *upa-tīrtha* of Kubjāmraka, and not Pandharpur.

  *Puṣkara, Puṣkarāraṇya,* (182-185, 237, 244). The Puṣkar lake, six miles from Ājmir. The area was formerly covered by a



forest apparently. The *Puṣkarāraṇya* on p. 237 may be one in the United Provinces.

  *Pṛthūdaka* (180-181, 250) Pehoa in Karnāl district in the Panjab, fourteen miles from Thanesar, The *Brahmayoni-tīrtha* is located here. (Cunningham, *Anc. Geog. of Ind.*, p. 101.)

  *Prabhāsa* (226) is Somnāth in Kathiawār; on p. 250, a Prabhāsa is referred to as a tīrtha near the Sarasvatī river, in the Kurukṣetra region. Prabhāsa on p. 247 appears to be the latter.

  *Plakṣa-prasravaṇa* (250) the spring from which the Sarasvatīhas its source.

  *Prayāga* (136-153) known as *Tīrtha-rāja* near Allahabad. Viṣṇu as Yogamūrti is said to be worshipped there (252).

  *Bṛndāvana* (187, 252) near Mathurā(Muttra) and now on the same side of the Jumna; but Nando Lal Dey (p. 42) suggests that it was pretty far from Mathurā (whereas modern Brindāvan is only six miles from it) and on the opposite side of the river to it.

  *Bhīmā,* (250) or *Bhīmarathī,* a tributary of the Kṛṣṇāin the Dakhan. Curiously, the main river does not appear to be referred to in the *Kalpataru* under *tīrthas*.

  *Bhṛgu-tuṅga* (246), is according to Nīlakaṇṭha one of the five Kedāras in Gahrwāl.

  *Mathurā* (188-190), modern Muttra.

  *Mandāra-giri* (251) a hill of the name in Bhagalpur district, Bihar.

 *Mahāvana* (259) is Vraja or Gokula.

  *Mahākāla* (236), kṣetra in Ujjain.

  *Mahā-gaṅgā* (246) is the Alakanandā, according to the Keśava. Vaijayatīof Nanda-paṇḍita.

  *Mahāsāra* (246). There is a village named Māsari n the district of Arrah, Bihar, which is identified with Mahāsāra but the context in which it is alluded to suggests a tīrtha further north-west.

  *Mahā-hrada* (245), a fountain in the Himālayan region, near Badarināth, judged by the context. It may be the same as *Gaṅgā-hrada* (p. 178) in Kurukṣetra.

  *Mahodadhi* (235), the Bay of Bengal.

  *Mahodaya* (237), Kanauj.

  *Mānasa-tīrtha.* Three bearing the name occur in the text. The first (145) is on the north bank of the Ganges at Allahabad;



 the second (206) is attached to Kubjāmraka; while the last (253) is mentioned vaguely suggesting North India.

  *Mānasa-saras* (198), a tīrtha in Gayā, not to be confused with Mānasa lake in Tibet, near Mt. Kailās.

  *Mārkaṇḍeya-tīrtha* is at the junction of the Sarayū with the Ganges near Chapra. (241)

 * Māhiṣmatī* (253) on the Narbuda, forty miles from Indore.

 * Maināka-parvata* (247) is the Sewalik range.

 * Yamunā* (186, 193) described as the daughter of the Sun, the Jumna. The Jumna is sacred from Mathurā to Prayāga.

 * Retodaka* (230) in Kedārnāth is a kunda in which Kārtikeya was born (*Skanda-purāṇa,* Maheśvarakhaṇḍa, I, 27; II, 29.

  *Revā* (243), usually identified with the Narmadā as in this śloka. But according to *Vāmanapurāṇa,* xiii, 25, 30, the two are distinct.

  *Rudrakoṭi* (241) at the source of the Narmadā. Sometimes identified with *Koṭi-kūpa* in Kurukṣetra.

  *Raivataka* (227), giri, Mount Girnar in Jūnāgadh.

  *Lāṅgulinī*(235) the Lāngulīya in Orissa. Chicacole stands on it.

 * Lohārgala* (252) Perhaps Lohāghāt on the river Lohā in Kumaon (*Kūrmācala).*

  *Lauhitya* (252) is probably the kuṇḍa at the source of the Candrabhāgā (Chenab). *Lauhitya* is also the Brahmaputra.

  *Varaṇā* (241) the Barṇa river, one of the limits of Vāraṇāsī (Kāśi).

  *Vitasiā* (246, 249, 252), the Jhelum.

  *Vidiśā* (241) Bhilsa in Bhopal state.

  *Vinaśana* (250), the spot in the Sirhind desert where the Sarasvati river is lost in the sands.

  *Vipāśā* (246, 249, 253) the Beas in the Punjab.

  *Virajā* (235) a river in Utkala (Orissa).

  *Viśālā* (249) an affluent of the Gandak. The context suggests a river not a town. In the latter case, it will refer to Ujjain.

 * Vetravatī* (241, 250), the Betwa river in Malwa.

  *Śatadru* (245), the Sutlej.

  *Śālagrāma* (252), a kuṇḍa near the source of the Gaṇḍak.

 *Śiprā* (236), the river on which Ujjain stands.

 Ś*ūhara* or *Sūkara* (209-212, 252), Soron on the Ganges, twentyone miles N.E. of Etah, U.P.

  *śoṇa* (239) the river Śone in Bihar,



  *Saptā-godavari* (239), Solangipur, a few miles from Pithāpuram.

  *Sarayū* (241, 233), the Sarjju or Goghra river on which Ayodhyā stands.

  *Sahy*ā*cala* (250), the northern section of the Western Ghats in S. India.

  *Sahyāmalaka* (254). Tirunelli in Wynad, S. Malabar probably.

  *Somatīrtha* (253), a *tīrtha* in Utkala in Orissa. Somnāth in Gujarat does not suit the context so well.

  *Hariharakṣetra* (252), Harihar on the Tungabhadrā, marking the frontier between Mysore state and the Bombay presidency.
