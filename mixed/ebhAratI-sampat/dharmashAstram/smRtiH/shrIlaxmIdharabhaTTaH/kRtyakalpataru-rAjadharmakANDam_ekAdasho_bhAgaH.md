**PREFACE**

ANCIENT INDIAN POLITY has been for many years inthe front line of topics of academic interest. The'discovery' of the ***Arthasâstr*a** of Kauṭilya and itspublication a decade later in 1909, was to orientalscholarship as ***the discovery the Institutes of Gaius***in 1816 was to students of Roman Law. The publication of its text and English translation coincidedroughly with the beginnings of the movement for Indian***Svar******â******j**.* Political interest proved both a stimulus anda handicap. It drew many students to the study ofour ancient political institutions. At the same time,it developed a tendency to see occasionally in the evidence it furnished much more than was strictly justified by critical scrutiny. Since then, a considerableliterature on the ancient Indian theory of the stateand Indian administrative institutions has come intoexistence. In the synthesis attempted in modern works,texts of ***Dharmasâstra*** have come to be drawn on side byside with those of the much smaller literature of Arthasastra. The tendency, however, has been to treat the former as subsidiary to the latter. ***Dharmasâstra*** is held topresent ideals, which were never wholly put into practice,while ***Arthasâstra*** or **Nītisâstra** is considered morevaluable because more realistic. Students of ***smrti*** andArthasâstra overlook the classical distinction betweenthe two, familiar to their predecessors centuries ago,and agree in holding **Arthasâstra** as wanting in the

canonical sanction that lay behind ***smṛti***.The error has spread even among paṇḍits professing to follow tradtion. In a polemic work, composed in recent years by three distinguished paṇḍits, in which certain reforms were subjected to criticism as contrary to Hindu Dharma, a specified view is summarily rejected on the ground (which itself is baseless) that it is an Arthaśāstra[dictum](# "Dharmapradipa, Calcutta, 1937."). As I have showed elsewhere, Arthaśāstra is among the eighteen sources of Dharma, and it is also brought under one of the [Upa-Vedas](# "Rajadharma, 1941, p. 95,").The rule in ***smṛti*** that in a conflict between Arthaśāstra and Dharmaśāstra the former must give way, refers not to the general inferiority of the former class to the latter, but to the superiority in Indian convention of rules which have an ***adṛṣṭa-phala*** behind them to those for which a visible benefit (***dṛṣṭa-phala***) can be shown. Both ***smṛti******s*** and works on on Arthaśāstra contain many dicta, under both these categories, and the standard set between the two must be applied in both. Concurrence of ***smṛti***and Arthaśāstra may indicate a close approximation to actual practice, where action is guided solely by volition or custom, but it will not make an action for which a ***dṛṣṭa-phala*** can be quoted of the same value as acts for which the sanction is based on their enshrining an ***adṛṣṭa-phala***. The criticism levelled against behaviourism-that it fails to furnish as secure a basis for ethics as transcendental sanction-is analogous to that levelled against ***artha*** rules as compared with Dharma precepts. The former are commendatory while the latter are mandatory. An ***artha*** precept may be over-ruled by even another ***artha*** precept, but no Dharma rule can be over-ruled at all. If a Dharma precept seems to be in conflict with another, the difference must be treated, in Indian convention, as apparent but not real, and as indicative of either a possibility of reconcilration or of allowing options to conduct.

  Many of those who have attempted a synthesis ofour old polity by utilizing indiscriminately the datafurnished by both sources, without visualizing the traditional values of the two types of dicta, which writerson both Arthaśāstraand Dharmaśāstra have accepted,have been led away from a correct apprehension of basicpolitical doctrines and facts, and have made statementsand drawn conclusions which are not correct or sound.Training in traditional methods of study and interpretation, for which many modern students evince little respect,is vital if one should grasp thoroughly teachings, statedcryptically or with exasperating brevity, in books of whichthe authorized interpretation has been transmitted onlyorally. Referring to the Buddhist Canon, T. W. RhysDavids long ago uttered the warning that a ***sūtra*** book wasnot intended to be ***read***; it was to be used merely as asyllabus of headlines, to be filled up by lessons from thosewho had received its interpretation orally from their teachers, to. whom it had descended in similar fashionthrough countless generations of past [teachers](# "Dialogues of the Buddha, Vol. I. Preface, pp. xx-xxii."). The harmdone to scholarship by the absence of such a training isintensified by two further causes: the first is the habit ofusing ancient books in modern translations, often madeby writers imbued with a contempt for the traditionalinterpretation that they had not themselves acquired; thesecond is ignoring the background in which the thoughthas to be viewed. Since the days of Max Müller, whovisualized the risk in regard to the study of Indianphilosophical systems, an indication of the commonpostulates of our philosophical systems finds some placein modern books on Indian [philosophy](# "Six Systems of Indian Philosophy, passim."). In studies ofancient Indian political theory and law, the practice is

not followed. To read the present into the past is an admitted defect in historical writing, in spite of the essential unity of human nature, which makes it possible to presume ***ordinarily*** that the same historic causes will have the same reactions at all times and places, ***other things being** **equal**.* A similar tendency may be recognized in many modern presentations of ancient Indian political thought in which the qualification implicit in the underlined clause is usually disregarded or forgotten. Much that seems trivial or absurd or unreasonable might be found to be quite defensible if the limiting conditions are recognized.

  The point may be illustrated by reference to the contents of the ***Rājadharmakāṇda*** of the ***Kṛtya-Kalpataru***. To one who would approach its study, let us say, in an English version, or even to one who reads it, as if it was a self-contained book, Lakṣmīdhara's treatment of ***Rā******jadharma*** will appear as lacking in a sense of proportion and as dominated by sectional motives. Overand over again the apparent privileges of one ***varṇa*** seemto be emphasized unjustifiably. Undue importance appears to be ascribed to ritual and magic, to the detaileddescription of omens and portents, and similar themeswhich offend our reason and taste. But it must be remembered that Lakṣmīdhara wrote at a time when Indiawas on the eve of the Muslim conquest, and the air wasfilled with anxiety. In such times, men turn back to oldbeliefs in magic and ritual, which are enshrined in popularmemory. We can see it today ! The signs can be read inhistory under similar circumstances in many countries inwhich the same vague fear of impending evil was oppressively present in the minds of both the common peopleand responsible leaders. True to the ideals of a ***nibandhakāra***, who selects only just those things as haveDharma sanction, Lakṣmīdhara indicates only those rites which (unlike the proverbial **Ś*yena-y******āga***) have Dharma

authority behind them, for the state to perform withcare and devotion, to ward off any unforescen dangersthat threaten the kingdom. His citation of Purāṇicauthority for the rites described in the concluding chaptersprovides canonical validity for those festivals and ceremonies. There are hundreds of similar ceremonies, whichhe has not included, and of which he must have beencognizant. The implications of the selection and conscious omission will appear only from a knowledge of the omitted rites. He must have believed, like his king and contemporaries, in their efficacy. The reassertion of theold sacerdotalism is explicable on the same grounds, asit is in the context of the Gupta empire, at the time ofits rise, after the period of Indo-Bactrian, Parthian andŚāka contacts, or at its decline when it had to face theHūṇa inundation.

  In studying a work like the ***Rājadharmakāṇḍa*** ofLakṣmīdhara, proper comprehension requires two otherantecedent conditions. Firstly, this section has tobe read in relation to all the other sections of thetreatise. Itsposition in the ***Kṛtya-Kalpataru*** is not amatter of accident. Lakṣmīdhara, with one possibleexception, and that a [contemporary](# "Gopala, author of the Kamadhenu, now lost, A section of it Rajaniti is referred to by Candesvara,"), - was the first of the ***nibandhak******ā******ras*** to provide a special sectionfor ***Rājadharma***, in its narrower sense. His example was not immediately followed. A section on the subject was not contemplated by Caṇḍeśvara in his***Dharmaratnākara***. His ***Rājanīti-ratnākara*** was composed when he had become an octogenarian, by specialrequest of his king. The title ***Rājanīti*** is significant.Dharmaśāstra lays down what is obligatory, while ***Nītisāstra*** deals with what is advisable. It is noteworthythat with rigorous consistency, Lakṣmīdhara deals onlywith what is laid down in ***smṛtis***, Purāṇas and other

sources of Dharma and does not quote any work onNītiśāstra or Arthaśāstra. Caṇḍeśvara does so, and sodo Mitramiśra, Nilakanṭha and Anantadeva. The constitutional implication of the difference is worth noting.To go against what is enjoined inDharmaśāstra is adereliction of duty, but to go against what is advisedin Nītiśāstra only amounts to unwisdom. Nītiśāstra derives its authority from the great names behind itsauthorship (e.g. Kauṭilya, Śukra) and from its appeal toreason. A work of the class is not correlated to any otherwork. In a digest of Dharma, every section must beconstrued in relation not only to every other section ofthe same work but to the entire body of Dharma literature,including ***all*** its sources. Primarily, it must be consistentwith the rest of the digest. The same topic will be treatedin a digest in different sections, as viewed from differentangles: ***e.g. varṇa*** immunities, crimes, marriage etc. A***nibandha*** must be read as a whole and judged as a whole,and not section by section, as if the parts were unrelatedand not inter-dependent.

   Judged in this way, the first thing to note is that the duty of a king is both personal and official, and the two are inseparable, so long as one is king. The slender sections on ***rājadharma*** in ***smṛtis*** claim to deal with the personal duty (***guṇa-dharma***) of the consecrated Kṣatriya (***murdhābhiṣikta***), which includes the duties of his station,of his ***varṇa*** and his ***āśrama*** (Gṛhastha). The comprehensive duty of the king is to maintain the scheme of ***varṇa*** and ***āśrama*** , and ***paripālana***, (protection, in the widest sense) includes this. The King and the Brāhmaṇa are saidto uphold jointly the world-order, and to have undertakena lifelong vow to do so (***dhṛta-vratau***). Neither can changethe social order or alter its features to the slightest extent.The all-embracing obligation thus laid upon the ruler, i.e.,the State, makes it necessary that the head of the executive, ***i.e***., the Rājan, must treat ***all*** Dharma as his duty,

***Rājadharma***. After Arthaśāstra works grew in numberand in influence, ***Rājadharma*** and ***Rajanīti***, were sometimes confused with each other, and the former came tomean only the enfeebled description of the state administration and the daily duties of the king. By overlooking the background of ***Rājadharma***, even in the restrictedsense, and reading the sections on it apart from their context in a large digest, much of political and institutional value is missed. In no other part of Dharmaśāstrais the task of interpretation by reference to the ***entire***content of Dharma more necessary than in that whichbears the title of ***Rājadharmakāṇḍa***. It has been the aimof the Introduction, prefixed to this edition of the eleventhsection of the ***Kṛtya-Kalpataru***, which bears this title, to attempt this task.

   Looked at in the light shed by the rest of Dharma literature, this section will be found to be both interestingand significant. When Lakṣmīdhara composed his digest,Indian independence had not been lost. IIc served a powerful king, and held, after his father, the position ofchief minister in a great kingdom. With the exception ofCaṇḍeśvara, the later writers on ***Rājadharma*** or ***Rājanīti*** were paṇḍits, not statesmen. The range of Lakṣmīdhara's reading is as wide as that of the best digest writers. A feature in which he excels is his faculty for selection and for terse comment. His views have to be inferred as much from his omissions as from his express citations. Later writers had neither his discrimination, nor perhaps his recognized authority. They became diffuse, repeated themselves, and padded their works with needless citations on the same topics.

  From the scrutiny of this section and its study in relation to the wide literature of Dharma, a number of conclusions emerge, which are detailed in the Introduction. Among them may be mentioned the conception of kingship as a position of dedicated service, and the

exposal of the misuse of the theory of the divine originof kingship in a defence of royal absolutism. There isno right divine to do wrong. The significance of the riteof ***abhiṣeka*** as a 'new birth' emerges. It is shown howthe social balance as well as internal order and externalsecurity, was ensured with the minimum of violence under ***Rājadharma***, in which ***duties*** were described and notprerogatives. There was no need to a king to take a coronation oath to rule justly. The obligation was implicitin the office of king, as part of ***rāja-dharma***, A properbalance between the use of force and the maintenanceof the rule of ***ahimsā*** resulted from it. The power of ***daṇḍa*** which was vested in the king, was not to be exercised capriciously, but only in accordance with rule.

  For many years ***Rājadharma*** has occupied the leisure of the editor, both in its wider and its narrower connotations. His results have been given in his ***Considerations on Ancient Indian Polity*** (1914, second edn. 1935, Madras University), ***Some Aspects of Ancient Indian Economic Thought*** (1934, Benares Hindu University) and Indian Cameralism (Calcutta University, 1934). In his luctures in the University of Madras on ***Rājadharma*** (Adyar Library, 1941) an attempt has been made to provide the prolegomena to the study of the literature of Dharmaśāstra. Reference to these may be permitted, as they carry on the consideration of aspects and topics, which have not been dealt with in the Introduction to this section of the ***Kṛtya-Kalpataru**.*

 ***Rājadharmakāṇḍa*** is the eleventh section of Lakṣmīdhara's ***nibandha***, and the third to be published, its predecessors in publication being the ***Dānakāṇḍa*** and the ***Tīrthakāṇḍa***, which form the fifth and eighth parts of the digest. In the Introduction to the last, the reasons for not following in publication the natural sequence of the sections have been briefly stated. A complete set of the ***nibandha*** does not exist anywhere now, except in my

possession. Two parts which were wanting, out of the fourteen, were discovered by me. Till recently, the beginning of one ***kaṇḍ******a*** was defective ; it has since been rectified by the discovery of a second manuscript. Even now the concluding portion of one of the earliest sections, for which only one manuscript is available, seems wanting. The manuscripts represent the achievement of generations of ignorant or careless scribes, and abound in omissions, wrong conjunctions and repetitions, as well as grammatical and scriptorial errors. Lakṣmīdhara had a wide repertory, and many of the works he cites are now lost. Several of them were in prose or in ***sūtra*** form. He had a high sense of textual accuracy, and his readings, where they differed from accepted versions, have been deferentially noticed by later writers, even when they related to the texts of ***smṛtis*** which had been commented on by distinguished scholiasts like Medhātithi or Viśvarüpa. Further, as regards the bulk of extant ***smṛtis***, the texts have not even now been established definitively. This may be seen in ***Vasiṣṭha******smṛti***, and to a smaller extent in *[Viṣnusmṛti](# "My edition of Vişnusmṛti with the Kesava-Vaijayanti is in the press, and will be published in the Adyar Library Series.")*. In editing the oldest surviving digest, an obligation therefore rests on its editor to collect ***every*** manuscript of ***every*** section of it, which is known to be in existence or which assiduous exploration may reveal. Many editions of ***nibandhas*** abound in errors which such an exhaustive survey might have avoided.

  The feeling of responsibility for presenting as full material as a collation of **all** available manuscripts can furnish has weighed upon the editor. The ***Rājadharmakāṇḍa*** fortunately existed in a manuscript, which was fairly complete and correct and came from the almost complete set in the Udaipur [Palace](# "It bears the date Samvat 1612 i.e., 1565 A.D."). It was immediately made the basis of the rough press copy. Soon after

(between June and September 1937) the manuscriptin the library of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal(No. III, G. 76) was secured and compared with the press copy. The Calcutta manuscript bears the date 1805 A.D. and it is a modern transcript. Some manuscripts of the ***kāṇḍa***, whose existence came to my notice subsequently (e.g., those in the Varendra Research Society, Rājashāhi, and in the Samskṛta Śahitya Pariṣad, Shyam Bazar, Calcutta) are merely copies of this manuscript. Of the two manuscripts in the India Office, which were also obtained for collation, only one had individual features. This bore the number 1386 and it is described in ***Eggeling's Catalogue of the Library.***The other manuscript furnished very few readings, was very defective in orthography and grammar, and claimed only to be a transcript made in 1865 A.D. of an older manuscript dated 1695, in an era that is not specified in the appended chronogram. After all these manuscripts had been utilized in collation, the press copy was sent to the press and the printing was finished upto the end of Appendix D before the end of 1938. While the printed sheets were kept aside, pending my getting the requisiteleisure for preparing an introduction, I came to know that a manuscript of the ***Kṛtya-Kalpataru***, which contained the ***Rājadharmakāṇḍa***, existed in the Anūp Library at Bikanir, though it was repeatedly declared as lost and not discoverable, when I applied for its loan. I obtained a transcript of it after several months, and added its readings as Appendix F. The date of this manuscript is Samvat 1737.

  Interruptions due to my work in connection with the starting of Śrī Veṅkaṭeśvara Oriental Institute at Tirupati, and the Tenth session of the All India Oriental Conference held at Tirupati, as well as other causes of a personal nature, delayed the composition of the Introduction that was felt to be necessary for a proper comprehension of the ***kāṇḍa***. Thus a book which has been virtually in print for four years is released only now.

  A year ago, when I was at Delhi, I saw an advertisement of an edition of ***Rājadharmakāṇḍa*** in the catalogue of a Lahore publisher. I obtained a copy of it and have now examined it. It has been edited and published at Lahore by Mr. Jagadish Lal Shastri, M.A., M.O.L., a research scholar of the Punjab University. It claims to be based on only one manuscript, ***viz***. that of the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal. It has an introduction in English which endeavours to furnish some information on Lakşmīdhara, the ***Kṛtya-Kalpataru*** and the available manuscripts of the ***nibandha*** as described in the published Catalogues of Manuscripts, Peterson's Report of 1883, and Rai Bahadur Man Mohan Chakravarty's papers in the J.A.S.B., 1915. A short account of Lakṣmīdhara, from Mahāmahopadhyāya P. V. Kane's ***History of Dharmaśastra***, volume I, is furnished. Mr. Jagadish Lal Shastri makes no reference to the edition of the ***Dāna-kāṇḍa***, which was published towards the end of 1941, as volume XCII of the Gaekwad's Oriental Series and to the Introduction of that volume where the date of Lakṣmīdhara and of the ***Kṛtya-Kalpataru*** is discussed, though his edition first appeared in the Lahore Oriental College Magazine only in May 1942. Since 1938 the fact of an edition of the ***Kṛtya*****-Kalpataru** being in preparation or in the press, has been notified in the lists added to the volumes of the Gaekwad's Oriental Series.

  The Lahore edition contains several errors both in the Introduction and in the body of the text. A few may be mentioned. On p. 5 of the Introduction, India Office Manuscript No. 1385, which contains only the ***Dānakāṇḍa*** ** (and which has been used in my edition of that ***kāṇḍa***) is described as containing twelve ***kāṇḍas***! The mistake seems to be due to taking the description of the digest, which is appended to the descriptive note in the ***Catalogue***, as an

indication of the contents of this manuscript. About eighteen instances were noticed in which the text, while claiming to follow the Asiatic Society's manuscript, has substituted for its readings those of Mitramisra's ***Rajanitiprakāśa***. On p. 57 the omission of some words in line 11 of the text makes it unintelligible. On p. 58 a ***sutra*** of***Viṣṇusmṛti*** (III,15) is combined with a comment, as if it were a part of it. On p. 63 a big gap of about two pages in the manuscript used has not been detected, with the result that a part of a ***sūtra*** of ***Vasiṣṭhasmṛti*** and a comment on it have been telescoped with a ***sūtra*** of ***Viṣṇusmṛti***. On p. 100 a ***sūtra***of ***Viṣṇusmṛti***is printed as a comment on a passage of ***Manusmrti***. These examples are illustrative. They point to the risks which are inevitable, when one attempts to print from only one manuscript, an important section of a ***nibandha*** of which other manuscripts are known to exist.

  It remains to make an acknowledgment of my obligations. In passing the edition through the press, I have been assisted by Mahāmahopādhyāya A. Chinnaswami Sastri, now Principal of the College of Oriental Learning in the Benares Hindu University as well as by my former student and frequent collaborator Mr. A. N. Krishna Aiyangar, M.A., L.T. of the Adyar Library. The General Editor of the Gaekwad's Oriental Series, Rājyaratna, Jñānajyoti Dr. B. Bhattacharyya, M.A., Ph.D., was compelled by the rule of the India Office precluding its manuscripts going out of the custody of the borrower, to do himself the collation of my press copy with the India Office Manuscripts. Such labor is not part of a General Editor's duty. I am specially grateful to him for having undertaken the task. I am under a special debt to Sir V. T. Krishnamacharya, K. C. I. E., Prime Minister of Baroda, for having secured for my use, a transcript of the ***Kṛtya-Kalpataru*** manuscript in the Anūp Library, Bikanir, after my attempts to do so had failed,

I learned of the existence of this manuscript in Bikanir, after it had been declared lost, through ***Tarkatīrtha*** Paṇḍit Laxman Shastri Joshi, the erudite editor of ***Dharmakośa*** and his assistants. Dr. C. Kunhan Raja, M. A., D. Phil. of the University of Madras, obtained for me particulars of the manuscript in the Anūp Library, which enabled me to secure a transcript of it ultimately through the Baroda Government. I am grateful to Mr. C. Subbarayudu, Superintendent of the Vasanta Press, Adyar, Madras, for kindly undertaking the printing of the Introduction and preliminary matter in spite of other commitments.

INTRODUCTION

**THE PLACE OF RAJADHARMA IN A DIGEST**

  IN the scheme of the ***Kṛtya-Kalpataru*** the eleventh and twelfth sections are assigned to the exposition of ***Rājadharma*** and ***Vyavahāra***. The specific duties of the king include the administration of law and justice. ***Vyavahāra*** is logically comprehended in ***Rājadharma*** in its narrower or specialised form. But its volume and complexity justify its treatment in a section by itself. ***Yājñavalkyasmṛti*** assigns, for instance, its central division to ***Vyavahāra***, but even there the treatment of ***Vyavahāra*** follows closely on the heels of the exposition of the specific duties of the crowned ***kṣatriya*** in the ***Ācāra*** section. The intimate connection between royal duties and law and procedure is the justification for some writers, like Anantadeva, the author of ***Rājadharmakauṣtubha***, who treat of ***Vyavahāra*** in their treatises on ***Rājadharma***. The relegation of the duties of the king and the administration of law and justice to almost the end of a comprehensive exposition of Dharma is also noteworthy. To a modern student, law and polity have more attraction than the description of the duties of the castes (***varṇa***) and orders (***āśrama***). In the Hindu view of life a king's efficient discharge of his duties is only the means to the end of all human activity, viz., freedom from rebirth (***mokṣa***). The ruler qualifies for it by discharging the duties of his station in the approved manner. The progress of his subjects towards the goal is rendered possible only if the head of civil society sees that there is order and justice within the state, protection for every one from external danger and from seasonal vicissitudes, which are due to the neglect of his spiritual or sacramental [duties](# " Cf. Rāmāyaṇa, I, 9, 7-8 on the long drought in`Aṅga— एतस्मिन्नेव काले तु रोमपादः प्रतापवान् । अङ्गेषु प्रथितो राजा भविष्यति महाबलः ॥"),and that the state maintains ***varṇāśrama-dharma*** and prevents the confusion which will spring from persons abandoning the duties of the station and birth and taking up other duties and from mistate of casts (***varṇasamkara***).

**THE SOCIAL BALANCE**

  The function of the ruler, i.e., of the state, is to maintain the social balance or, to vary the metaphor, to keep the ring. Every person's salvation depends primarily on his own efforts. He approaches or recedes from the goal according as he fulfils his appointed duties or neglects them. In the four stages of life, (***āsrama***), the first is mainly educative, while the last signifies a withdrawal from society, except to the extent of being dependent on society for the support of life till the moment of dissolution arrives. Society, as well as all individual and social effort, is based on the existence of the second ***āsrama***, i.e.,of the houscholder ([***gṛhastha***](# "See the Brahmacārikānḍa of the Kṛtyakalpataru, and Manusmṛti, III, 77-80, Vasiṣṭha, VIII, 14-16, and Viṣṇusmṛti, LXIX, 27-29."))¹. He alone is competent to dischange the triple debt. *(**ṛna-traya***) in which man is born, viz., the debt to sages (**ṛṣi-ṛṇa**), the debt to the gods (***deva-ṛṇa***), and the debt to progenitors (***pitṛ-ṛṇa***), and he does so by study and teaching, by worship and by continuing the family line by marriage and [progeny](# " देवानाञ्चपितॄणाञ्चऋषीणाञ्च तथा नरः । ॠणवान् जायते यस्मात्तन्मोक्षे प्रयतेत्सदा ॥ देवानामनृणो जन्तुः यज्ञैर्भवति मानवः । अल्पवित्तश्चपूजाभिरुपवासव्रतैस्तथा ॥ श्राद्धेन प्रजया चैव पितॄणामनृणो भवेत् । ॠषीणां ब्रह्मचर्येण श्रुतेन तपसा तथा ॥                इति विष्णुधर्मोत्तरे ।Seealso महाभारत, आदि, ६३, २५.").The second stage of life (***gṛhasthāsrama***) is also the only one of the four to which men of every caste (***varṇa***) are eligible.

  In the orderly sequence of divisions of the ***Kṛtya-Kalpataru***, the first section deals with the first stage of life (***brahmacaryāśrama***) and the second undertakes a general survey of the second

तस्य व्यतिक्रमाद्राज्ञो भविष्यति सुदारुणा।  
अनावृष्टिस्सुघोरा वै सर्वभूतभयावहा॥

stage (***gṛhasthāsrama***), followed up in the third by details of the householder's daily duties (***āhnika***). The next seven sections deal with the various ways in which the householder (and sometimes men of the other ***āsramas*** also) may effectively discharge the debts to the gods, to God and to ancestors. These are open in varying degrees to members of all ***varṇas***. On the second ***varṇa***, ***viz***., the ***kṣatriya*** devolves the duty of assuming the protection of the entire society and of maintaining the social order by undertaking the functions and obligations of [government](# "cf. Paraśarasmṛti, I,61 – क्षत्रियो हि प्रजा रक्षन्शस्त्रपाणिः प्रदण्डवान् । निर्जित्य परसैन्यानि क्षितिं धर्मेण पालयेत् ॥").The eleventh section naturally follows with a treatment of the specific duties (***guṇadharma***) of the consecrated ***kṣatriya***, and, by extension of the idea, of any one on whom the duties of the ***kṣatriya*** devolve, even if he is not a member of the second ***varṇa***. The twelfth division, which details civil and criminal law, is a supplement to the eleventh. In the nicely balanced order of the Universe, any neglect of individual or collective duty, may have grave results, and to obviate them propitiatory rites of both a personal and ***public*** character are prescribed. Hence the proper place for their consideration is after the discussion of ***Rāja*- *dharma***. The driving motive for all human effort being the aspiration for ***mukti*** (release), the treatment of ***mokṣa*** is the logical finial to the edifice of ***Dharmaśāstra***. ***Mokṣakāṇda*** is accordingly the concluding book of Lakṣmīdhara's great digest. The order of treatment is roughly anticipated in the most authoritative of ***smṛtis***, ***viz**. **Manava-dharmaśāstra.***



THE POSTULATES OF DHARMA

  The basic assumptions of Dharma include a primary and general duty, devolving on every one, to maintain the division of 'castes and orders' (***varṇāśrama***). Its fundamental tenets have universal applicability, in space and time, and in that sense are described as ***sanātana*** (cternal). In an important but superficial feature works on ***Dharmaśāstra*** differ from the ethical or moral codes of other peoples, ancient or modern. Not only modern legislative acts, but even such statements of moral ideals as the

Christian decalogue, state what should not be done. Their position is negative. In the ***Dharmaśāstra***, on the other hand, one is told what should be done, what any particular person should not leave undone. The difference reflects a fundamental ditterence in outlook. In the Indian view (Brahmanical, Jaina or Buddhist) man is an animated bundle of duties. When every one does his or her duty, universal harmony results. Neglect of one's duty recoils not merely on the delinquent but upsets the whole established order. The magnitude of the evil which might follow individual default and afflict society calls for a corresponding strength in the regulating authority, which will reduce the lapses from duty in number and gravity. The weight of the authority of the whole community should be behind the maintenance of Dharma. The head of the community (i.e., the ruler) or its spiritual and intellectual leaders should exercise this power. In organized society, the ruler alone can apply in all such cases the requisite social pressure. The upkeep of Dharma in all its protean forms becomes therefore the first duty of the state and its head. All Dharma is ***Rājadharma***. The reach of the state's duty extends to every form of activity.



THE WIDE RANGE OF RĀJADHARMA

  In recent times the wider conception of ***Rājadharma*** has become obscured but the implications of the term in its larger and narrower sense have always been understood by Indian writers. In the ***Mahābhārata***, Dharma and ***Rājadharma*** are used indifferently to signify the corpus of Dharma. In requesting Bhīṣma to explain ***Rājadharma*** to him, Yudhiṣṭhira, to show its value declares how all sentient beings depend on *[**Rājadharma**](# "सर्वस्य जीवलोकस्य राजधर्मः परायणम् ।")*and the four ends of life (***catur-varga***) are elucidated by it. This is made still more explicit in a further declaration that the safe-guarding of the duties of the four ***vargas*** (***cāturvarṇyasya dharmasya rakṣā***) is the king's dharma (***rājñām dharmaḥ***). The comprehensive character of ***Rājadharma***is emphasized in Bhīṣm'sdeclaration, at the end of a panegyrical passage, that

"all Dharma has entered into *[**Rājadharma**](# "सर्वे धर्माः राजधर्मे प्रविष्ठाः(शान्तिपर्व, ६२, ३०)")*."The first work on the science, the thousand- chapter treatise of Svayambhū(Brahma) is stated to have dealt with the customs of nations, castes and [clans](# "देशजातिकुलानाञ्चधर्माः समनुवर्णिताः (अ. ५८, ७४).") as was required in a work of such universal applicability. The idea is also implicit in the rules for the education of princes, which makes it obligatory for the future king to possess a competent knowledge of all [Dharma](# "धर्माधर्मान्, विजानन्हि शासतेऽभिरतः सताम् । प्रजां रक्षेन्नृपस्साधुः ह्यन्याच परिपन्थिनः ॥"), and in the composition by royal command of digests of the over-grown Dharma literature for their use.

  So vast a range places the " Dharma of kings" beyond the capability of most rulers. A king is under Dharma in two capacities, i.e., as a person, of a definite ***varṇa***, subject to the Dharma of that ***varṇa***, and secondly as a crowned ruler. In the second capacity, as a public functionary, he has duties which he is expected to discharge directly and those which he discharges indirectly through skilled helpers. He cannot shed his personal obligations, and cannot prudently delegate some of his more important regal duties. The definition and elucidation of these is necessary for successful kingship or administration. The parallel development of ***Arthasāstra*** resulted in an elaboration of the duties more directly concerned with government of states. The sciences of Dharma and Artha deal with the modes of attainment of these two ends of life (***puruṣārtha***). The other two ends are the satisfaction of the emotions, especially those resulting in pleasure of the senses (***kāma***) and ***mokṣa*** or liberation of the spirit. The last is the ultimate and highest end, to which the others only lead. ***kāma***and Artha are proximate ends, and in their relative importance the ultimate aims are the most important. The [***Mahābhārata***](http://॑# "शान्तिपर्व, अ. १६७, ८, यथा – धर्मोराजन् गुरुश्रेष्ठो मध्यगो ह्यर्थउच्यते । कामो यवीयानिति च प्रवदन्ति मनीषिणः ॥") declares the accepted Indian view that of the three ***puruṣārthas***, ***Dharma*** is the best, Artha is next best and ***Kāma*** is the lowest, and that both ***Artha*** and ***Kāma***

spring from [Dharma](# "स्वर्गारोहणपर्व, अ. ५, ६२, यथा- ऊर्द्ध्वबाहुर्विरोम्येष नच कश्चित्शृणोति मे । धर्मादर्थश्चकामश्चस किमर्थंन सेव्यते ॥").This view is endorsed by both Kauṭilya and Vātsyāyana, who however declare that ***Artha*** is the chief end of the king. The complexity of human nature makes it impossible to convert it to pure asceticism and to a contempt for economic and emotional satisfactions. Accordingly, there is unanimity in laying down that each end (except, ***Mokṣa***) should be striven for, if it does not conflict with those preceding. A comfortless life is not for man. The subordination of lower aims to the higher is part of the discipline of life, which will lead to the ultimate [goal](# "कामसूत्रे (२, १४-१६) यथा - “तेषां समवाये पूर्वःपूर्वो गरीयान् । अर्थश्चराज्ञः । तन्मूलकत्वाल्लोकयात्रायाः” । अर्थशास्त्रे, ( १, ७) यथा – “धर्मार्थाविरोधेन कामं सेवेत न निस्सुखस्स्यात् । समं वा त्रिवर्गमन्योन्यानुबन्धम् । एको हि अत्यासेवितो धर्मार्थकामानां आत्मानमितरौ च पीडयति । अर्थ एव प्रधान इति कौटिल्यः । अर्थमूलौ हि धर्मार्थकामौ इति").***Arthaśāstra***recognized the paramountcy of Dharma, and regarded it as a common denominator of all action, while for human expediency, it stresses the greater importance of Artha. The ultimate sanctions of ***Dharma*** and ***Artha*** are to be found in a common source, viz. ***Śruti***, i.e. the Veda. The end of society is the same for both. "The king should permit no neglect by living beings of their appropriate duty (***svadharma***). By standing fast in one's duty, happiness is possible in lifeas in death. Society (lokaḥ) prospers and doesnot decay, when it maintains the bounds of conduct of Aryas (***vyavasthitārya*-*maryādaḥ***), stabilizes the order of easter and stages of life (***kṛtavarṇāsrama-sihitiḥ***) and seeks refuge in the Vedas ([***traiyāhi rakṛitaḥ***](# "तस्मात्स्वधर्मं भूतानां राजा न व्यभिचारयेत्। स्वधर्मं सन्दधानो हि प्रेत्यचेहच नन्दति ॥ व्यवस्थितार्यमर्यादः कृतवर्णाश्रमस्थितिः । त्रय्या हि रक्षितो लोकः प्रसीदति न सीदति ॥ (१ , ३.)"))."For the normal upkeep of organized political order it is sufficient to take a lower standard than for the determination of what is ***Dharma*** and what is ***A-dharma***. But, when there is a conflict between ***Dharmasāstra*** and the science of affairs (***vyāvahārikam sāstram***), admits Kauṭilya (III, 1), the rule of ***Artha*** has to be construed in

consonance with those of [Dharma](# "संस्थया धर्मशास्त्रेण शास्त्रं वा व्यावहारिकम् । यस्मिन्नर्थे विरुध्येत धर्मेणार्थंविनिश्चयेत् ॥ (पृ. १५०.)"). Dharmasāstra deals with action that is enjoined, and therefore beyond argument. Arthasāstra deals with action that is manifestly feasible and advantageous. In ***smṛtis*** an Artha content is to be found, while the normal material of Arthasāstra is Dharma. It is on this account that it wellknown text of **[*Yājṅvalkya*](# "स्मृत्योर्विरोधे न्यायस्तु बलवान् व्यवहारतः । अर्थशास्त्रात्तु बलवद्धर्मशास्त्रमिति स्थितिः ॥ २, २१ .)")**
(II, 21) lays down the superiority of an injunction of Dharma to one relating to worldly affairs (*Artha*). It is rightly interpreted by ***[Vijñāneśvara](# "धर्मशास्त्रानुसारेणेत्यनेनैव औशनसादि अर्थशास्त्रनिरस्तत्वात् धर्मशास्त्रान्तर्गतमेव राजनीतिलक्षणमर्थशास्त्रमिह विवक्षितम् । . . . . किमत्रोदाहरणम् । न तावत् — ")***as referring not to the inferiority of the science of Arthasāstra generally hut to ***Artha*** rules contained in ***smṛtis***. He illustrates the point thus. A manifest assassin (***ātatāyin***) may be killed whatever be his status, age or spiritual relationship (***Manusmṛtis***, viii, 350-351). But, by another rule, there is no expiation possible for killing a Brährmaṇa (Ib.,xi, 89). The second rule is absolute; therefore, the first merely aims at showing the enormity of assassination. The first rule is therefore an Arthasāstra rule, and is superseded by the second, which is an injunction of Dharma.

  A common aim, viz., the upkeep of the order of **varṇa** and **āśrama**, which can be brought about only by the existence of a supreme human authority supervising conduct and enforcing conformity by penalties, unites both the Dharmasāstra and the Arthasāstra in regarding political union and the state, as well as the power of punishment (**Daṇḍa**), as of divine creation. Both laud the king (i.e., the state ) and magnify the sovereign. The state, i.e. the king, was brought into existence to end

anarchy and to restore and maintain Dharma. All Dharma is within the ambit of the king's responsibility. As the duty can be discharged only by the display or by the use of the coercive power of the state, all Dharma becomes subject to the king's jurisdiction. The former defines the attitude of Dharmasāstra, and the latter that of Arthaśāstra. The only difference lies in the elaboration which rules of duty (Dharma) underwent in Arthaśāstra, which had to concern itself as much with what was enjoined as with what was feasible and advantageous to the community. The treatment of administrative matters was therefore fuller in works on Arthaśāstra or ***Rājanīti*** than in Dharmaśāstra digests or ***smṛtis***.

  Many topics of ***Rājanīti*** do not appear in the sections on Rājadharma in ***dharma*-*nibandhas***, because they are dealt with in other sections of the digests. Another reason for the comparatively smaller bulk of works on Rājadharma is that by convention writers on ***Nītiśāstra*** or Arthaśāstra are not citedin digests of Dharma. The cause is not due to any idea of the unauthoritative nature of Arthaśāstra. Such an apprehension is cleared up by the addition of four subjects ***viz***., Āyurveda, Gāndharva-veda, Dhanurveda and Arthaśāstra to the fourteen sources of learning or Dharma (***vidyāsthāna***) enumerated by Yājñavalkya [(I, 3).](# " पुराणन्यायमीमांसाधर्मशास्त्राङ्गमिश्रिताः । वेदाः स्थानानि विद्यानां धर्मस्य च चतुर्दश ॥ (याज्ञ. १, ३.) ॥")This is done by the ***Viṣņuþurāṇa***, from which the ślokas are cited by Lakṣmīdhara in the ***paribhāṣā*** section of the [***Kṛtya-Kalpataru***.](# "अङ्गानि वेदाश्चत्वारो मीमांसा न्यायविस्तरः । धर्मशास्त्रंपुराणं च विद्या ह्येताश्चतुर्दश॥ आयुर्वेदोधनुर्वेदोगान्धर्वश्चेति ते त्रयः ।अर्थशास्त्रं चतुर्थं च विद्या ह्यष्टादश स्मृताः ॥ इति विष्णुपुराणे (३, ६.२८, २९.) ।")Aparārka has argued that while the fourteen mentioned by Yājñavalkya are described as sources of learning as well as Dharma, the four added to the fourteen are described only as ***viḍyāḥ***, and that therefore the four are not as authoritative as sources of Dharma as the remaining [fourteen](# "तत्केवलं विद्यास्थानत्वाभिप्रायं, न धर्मस्थानत्वाभिप्रायम् । आयुर्वेदादीनां च धर्मस्थानत्वाभावात् । चतुर्दशग्रहणात् ॠते अथर्ववेदसङ्ग्रहो न स्यात् । इति अपरार्कः(६. ६) ।").Lakṣmīdhara, whose view is endorsed in almost the same words by Mitramiśra in ***paribhāṣā-prakāśa***

states on the other hand that the fourteen pertain to Dharma (whose effects at invisible, ***adṛṣṭārtha***) while the additional four like Arthasāstra deal with visible wordly matters (***adṛṣṭārtha***), and they are alsosources of [Dharma](# "“चतुर्दशधर्मप्रमितिं प्रतिप्रधानानि । चतस्रःपुनर्दृष्टप्रधानाः काचिदलौकिकमर्थं प्रमाणयन्त्यो धर्मेऽपि प्रमाणम्").But throughout his great ***nibandha*** there is not a single citation from any work of *Arthaśāstra*. The reason should be sought not in any low estimate of the authoritative character of Arthaśāstra, but in the circumstance that the authors of books on Arthaśāstra, unlike the authors of ***smṛtis***, are not sages or semi-divine beings but ordinary men, eminent as scholars or statesmen. The distinction is not kept in mind by later writers like Mitramiśra and Bhaṭṭa Nīlakanṭḥa, who freely quote the ***Nītisāra*** of [Kāmanḍaka](# "Mitramiśra quotes Kāmandaks only once (p. 30) in Nitiprakāsa, but Nīlakanṭḥa quotes him fifty-nine times in Nītimayūkha.").It is noteworthy that citations from Kauṭilya (wrongly printed as ***Kauṇḍinya***) are to be found in ***Jīmūtavāhana's [Vyavahāramātṛkā](# "Of the six quotations from 'Kaundinya' (pp. 288 and 340-1) one is a quotation from the Kauṭiliya, while the others are paraphrases of passages in the Arthaśāstra.I pointed this out first in my Anoient Indian Polity, p. 136.")***, Lakṣmīdhara is more consistent in his principle and practice. The inclusion of Arthaśāstra under Upa-veda which he sanctions in ***Vyavahārakāṇḍa***, would also stand in the way of his rejecting its authority, especially in a digest of Rājadharma.



LAKṢMĪDHARA'S CLAIMS

  Judged by bulk, the ***Rājadharma-kāṇḍa*** of ***Kṛtya-Kalpataru*** is one of its smaller divisions. To a modern student of ancient Indian polity, it will also appear somewhat barren and theoretical, when compared with for example, the ***Kauṭilīya***. In the [*mangalaśloka*](# "न्याय्ये वर्त्मनि यज्जगद्गुणवतां गेहेषु यद्दन्तिनो राज्ञां मूर्द्धनि यत्पदं व्यरचयद्गोविन्दचन्द्रो नृपः । तत्सर्वं खलुयस्य मन्त्रमहिमाश्चर्यं स लक्ष्मीधरः काण्डं शंसति राजधर्मनिचयानैकादशे पुण्यधीः ।")[*⁴*](# "न्याय्ये वर्त्मनि यज्जगद्गुणवतां गेहेषु यद्दन्तिनो राज्ञां मूर्द्धनि यत्पदं व्यरचयद्गोविन्दचन्द्रो नृपः । तत्सर्वं खलुयस्य मन्त्रमहिमाश्चर्यं स लक्ष्मीधरः काण्डं शंसति राजधर्मनिचयानैकादशे पुण्यधीः ।")

[](# "न्याय्ये वर्त्मनि यज्जगद्गुणवतां गेहेषु यद्दन्तिनो राज्ञां मूर्द्धनि यत्पदं व्यरचयद्गोविन्दचन्द्रो नृपः । तत्सर्वं खलुयस्य मन्त्रमहिमाश्चर्यं स लक्ष्मीधरः काण्डं शंसति राजधर्मनिचयानैकादशे पुण्यधीः ।") Lakṣmīdhara claims to be animated by the

spirit of piety (***puṇyadhīḥ***), as one who essays to expound Dharmasāstra should be, to have assuredly (***Khala***) lwen responsible for ensuring the supremacy of Govindacandra over many kings by his advice and spells (***mantra***), and to have by his counsel made the king tread the path of justice and liberality to the good men of the world. The use of ***mantra*** in its double sense is significant. As chief minister it was his duty to guide the king by timely and wholesome advice. As chief priest he ensured victories by the use of appropriate spells or prayers. The importance attached by him to the superhuman factor in ensuring worldly success, particularly in a king, will be evident in the inclusion in this section of the digest of instructions for the correct performance of many rites in festivals and worship of certain divinities, for the welfare of the State. They are scattered throughout the book and also take up the last seven chapters of the section, which is divided into twenty-one sections in [all](# "Lakṣmīdhara does not specify the number of chapters. In this edition the book is divided into 21 sections. The Lahore edition by dividing chapter XIV into two, makes the chapters twenty-two.").Unless Govindacandra, as well as his contemporaries, acquiesced in the services thus claimed, as rendered to his king and country by Lakṣmidhara, it is inconceivable that he would have been allowed to state them so openly in a work written under a royal mandate.

  The assignment of a section of a ***dharma-nibandha*** to the exposition of the ***guṇa-dharma*** of the crowned ***kṣatriya** (**mūrdhābhiṣikta**)* is dictated by the importance of the subject. In one respect Lakṣmīdhara stands above later writers on the subject. His king was a powerful independent ruler, whose authority extended over a considerable area of Hindusthan. The life of Govindacandra was eventful, and he was largely the architect of the Gāhadwāla empire. Lakṣmīdhara himself was no mere arm-chair political theorist. He was a tried and successful statesman and administrator, who guided the foreign policy of an adventurous and ambitious ruler in eventful times. The fact that his father had held the same offices, and circumstances pointing to his association with Govindacandra during the years in which, as crown prince, he virtually held the reins of the kingdom, would point to Lakṣmīdhara being a grandee of

the chief court in North India in his day. He belongs thus to the class of writers, whose works derive additional weight from their being distinguished statesmen, empire builders and administrators. Hemadri and Todarmal had administrative experience comparable with his, but had perhaps not the same guiding influence on the foreign policy of their kings. Kauṭilya is a more eminent tigure of the class, while Mādhavācārya might well be placed after Lakṣmīdhara in the category.



FEATURES OF THE WORK

  The great expectations raised by these features may not be met by a study of this book. But, it should not be ascribed either to capacity and experience of the author not being up to the level of his position and record, or to the sterility of Rājadharma as such. The chief function of the author of a digest is to select his citations wisely and string them up with brief explanatory notes. Many topics and dicta, which a statesman might well be expected to deal with in a work on polity, will be excluded in an exposition confined to the positive injunctions laid down in ***smṛtis*** for the regulation of the life and activity of an orthodox king. The hypotheses of Dharma necessitate a static, ns contrasted with a dynamic, treatment. Matters which will be stated openly in a modern work on polity, will have to be gathered in a ***dharma-nibhandha*** by inference from scattered dicta. Works on kingcraft, which are realistic, tend to become secret possessions of rulers and ministers. As the mark of Dharma is its mandatory character, the principles of Rājadharma gain a constitutional significance, from their imposition on rulers and their accessibility to every man. Behind bald statements and injunctions lie hidden propositions of constitutional importance. Without comments which bring out their full implications it will be difficult to search a proper appreciation of a work like the ***Rājadharmakāṇḍa*** of the ***Kṛtya*-*Kalpataru***.



LITERATURE OFRĀJADHARMA

  The discrimination between **Rājadharma** and **Nītiśāstra**, which is seen in Lakṣmīdhara's work, appears to have been

forgotten by later writers on Rājadharma, as part the ***dharmanibandhas*** which they composed. Caṇḍeśvara (e. A. D. 1300), who counts Lakṣmīdhara as one of his models and who borrows wholesale from ***Kṛtya-Kalpataru**,* names the supplement which he composed to the seven ***ratnākaras**, **Rājaniti-ratnākara**.* It was apparently not in his original scheme, and the composition of the supplement was undertaken by command of king Bhaveśa, who is identified with Bhavasimha of the Kāmeśvara dynasty of Tirhut, who became king in succession to his brother Kāmeśvara about 1370. The dynasty was set up by the sultan of Delhi. Its first ruler was the ***rāja-guru*** or spiritual preceptor of the former kings of Mithila. As Caṇḍeśvara claims to have performed a ***tulāpuruṣadāna***, after a successful expedition into Nepal in A. D. 1314, he must have been about 85 years old when he composed his treatise. Coming of a family of prime ministors and having also held the office of chief justice, Caṇḍeśvara had qualifications for composing a digest, comparable in every way to Lakṣmīdhara's. He states in the introductory verses that Bhaveśa commanded him to prepare a digest of rajaniti *(**rājanīti-nibandhaka***). According to Kāmandaka, Nitisàstrat is the nectar churned out of the ocean of [Arthaśāstra](# "See his description of Kauṭilya (I, 6). नीतिशास्त्रामृतं श्रीमानर्थशास्त्रमहोदधेः । य उद्दध्रे नमस्तस्मै विष्णुगुप्ताय वेधसे ।").'¹That Caṇḍeśvara regarded the ***Rājanītiratnākara*** as a supplement to his seven-volume digest of Dharmaśāstra (each of which bore a title ending with the word Ratnākara, i.e., ocean) is evident from the title he gave to the work of his old age. The titles of other works composed after he had completed the seven-volume digest do not bear this ***mudrā***: they are named ***Kṛtyacintāmaṇi***, ***Dānavakyāvali*** and ***Śivavākyāvali***. Though he draws freely on works on Nītiśāstra like Kāmandaka's ***Nītiśāra***, the distinction between this class of literature and a Dharmaśāstra-nibandha was apparently not known to him. For, he cites Lakṣmīdhara's work as ***Nīti-kalpataru*** (p. 8). He cites a passage from the work of Kāmandaka (p. 55) as ***Arthaśāstra***. This looseness of expression and citation of both Dharma and Nīti works in 'a ***Dharma-nibandha***is equally evident in the works of Mitramiśra and Nīlakanṭha. The work of the former is named ***Rājanītiprakāśa*** and of the latter ***Rājanīti***or ***Nītimayūkha***. Both cite the ***Kāmandakīya***.

Anantadeta gives the title ***Rajadharmakaustubha*** to his work, and does not quote any work on ***Nitiśāstra***, but this is perhaps accidental, for he refers to the corresponding section of the ***Kṛtya-Kalpataru*** as the ***Nīti******kiṇḍa*** of the ***Kalpataru*** (p. 326). The nice distinction between the two categories seems to have become obseute even by the fourteenth century. The lost work of Lakṣmīdhara's friend and contemporary (***vayasya***) Gopāla had apparently a section on Rājadharma but it is cited in Caṇḍeśvara's work as ***Rājanīti-Kāmadhenu*** (p. 2, p. 4) just as Lakṣmīdhara's work is referred to in the same book as ***Nīti-Kalpatru***. Caṇḍeśvara obviously paraphrased both titles.

**  *Kṛtya-Kalpataru*** is virtually the only digest composed for a powerful and independent Hindu king. When Indian independence was lost, and non-Hindu supremacies were established over areas formerly under independent Hindu rulers, the composition of summaries of Dharma dealing with Rājadharma would seem purposeless. The failure to include sections on Rājadharna in later digests or the perfunctory composition of such sections, when composed merely to round off a digest, may he explained in this way. But foreign conquest did not fail to leave its mark on some doctrines of Rājadharma in the works composed in the period of Musulman supremacy. Caṇḍeśvara for instance, as the minister of a ruler who was a tributary of the Musulman sultan of Delhi, and who was also not a **kṣatriya**, recognized the incongruity of his giving the old Dharma rules making **abhiṣeka** obligatory for a king and restricting sovereignty to members of the second **varṇa**. The sacrament of coronation, which the **Kāmadhenu**, along with Lakṣmīdhara, had insisted on, to mark the commencement of sovereign power and obligations, is therefore rejected by Caṇḍeśvara, who argues that the theory of consecration fails to account for the beginning of the authority of a conqueror over territories gained by his [prowess](# "राजनीतिकामधेनौ 'राज्याभिषिक्तो राजा प्रजापालनादेस्तदीयत्वात् तत्प्राक् ज्ञानसंभवाश्च' इति ; प्रजापालने प्रवृत्तः इति बहवः । वस्तुतस्तु प्रजापालनप्रवृत्यभिषेकादयोऽस्य कारणमात्रं प्रजास्वामित्वे राजत्वेन प्रसिद्धो राजा ; 'केवलशौर्याद्याप्तराज्यस्य राजत्वव्यवहारात्' इति गुरवः । (राजनीतिरत्नाकर, पृ. ३) ।")(**kevalam śauryāt-prāpta-rājyasya rājatva vyavahārāt**, p. 3). Kullūka (C. A. D. 1250) had already anticipated the point by declaring

that the word ***rājā*** in ***Manusmṛti***, VII, I, was notrestricted to ***kṣatriyas***, and his opinion is cited by Caṇḍeśvara with approval.

  In the literature of Rājadharma, Lakṣmīdhara's contribution to it remains the only work which strictly follows the old distination between Dharma and ***Nīti***. He for one avoids the enor

of commentators on the ***Rāmāyaṇa***orthe ***Mahabharata*** who elucidate passages on Rājadharma in the epics by citations from the ***KāmandakīyāNītisāra***.



PLAN OF RĀJADHARMAKĀṆḌA

  Lakṣmīdhara divides his book into chapters of unequal length. They fall into three well marked divisions. The Indian state is traditionally held to be composed of seven elements (***saptāṅga***) beginning with the king or ruler. To these the first twelve chapters are devoted. They form the first division. The six-fold policy (***sãḍ-guṇyam***) is expounded in the second division, which takes up the next two chapters. A chapter (the fourteenth) recites the duties of the king more fully than in the first division. The third division comprises the last seven chapters, which deal with ritual performances that advance the welfare of the state. The scheme is roughly followed by later writers like Mitramisra, who essay an even fuller treatment of Rājadharma. The traditional order of discussion is illustrated by Kamandaka's work and the seventh book of ***Manusmṛti***, as well as the Kauṭilīya Arthasāstra (especially books VI and VII).



NECESSITY FOR THE STATE

  The belief in the entire system of the Universe being divinely ordained and governed by an immutable system of castes and orders, whose equipoise is a necessity for universal harmony, is responsible, as already pointed out, for the craving for a strong power able to prevent any disturbance of the social order and to keep every one within his bounds. A stateless or, to use the more common expression, a kingless condition spells anarchy, confusion and violent dislocation of the social order. The restraint on individual volition and freedom, which the system of ***varṇāśrama*** implies, because it takes away the option to change

one's caste or occupation, necessitates, as a logical corollary, the existence of both an external agency that can maintain the restraints, and arrangements which will induce willing and habitual submission to the restrictions on freedom. The inculcation of a belief in the divine creation of the order, which reduced individual freedom, and of the hopelessness and impiety of endeavouring to unsettle it, is a pre-requisite of the ***voluntary*** acceptance of the system. This is the task of Dharmaśāstra. The external agency, which can secure the object, is political organization, providing a strong executive armed with penal power. The vivid descriptions in the epics and literature of the evils that follow anarchy, in æons in which human nature is imperfect and fallible, furnish both the justification for political union, involving the submission of the many to one executive, and the rational inducements to agree to end the anarchy in that [way](# "On the horror of anarchy see the extracts in Ano. Ind. Polity, p. 49 and pp. 82-83.").The ascription of a divine origin to kingship, i.e., the state, makes disruptive action both a sin and a treason. Mere union is insufficient to combat the tendencies to anarchy. The authority which stands for the union must be armed with the power to punish. The power of just coercion must be placed beyond discussion. If divinely created the power gets beyond human criticism. Indian political thought can recognize a philosophical anarchism as possible only in the Golden Age. Kingship or the state is, in Indian legend, an after-thought of the Creator. A pre-political state preceded the political. The king was created by the Lord (***Prabhu***) to end the clamour following the confusion and anarchy of the kingless, i.e., stateless condition of [man](# "Ibid., pp. 39, 80 and 81. For the legend of the creation of Kingship and the Social Contract, see Manusmrti, VII, 3, Mahābhārata, Śāntiparva, ch. 67-68, Kauṭilīya, I, 13, and Sukranīti, I, II, 125-140.").A social compact in which the king pledges himself to maintain the divinely sanctioned social order an Dharma, and the people agree to support the executive by obedience and contributions is the consequence of the creation. The legend is found not only in the sources and in the body of Dharmaśāstra but it is found in Arthaśātra also. The king wields 'the rod of punishment' or Daṇḍa. Daṇḍa is really Dharma (Duty), given that form by the [Creator](# "I, 358.")(**Dharmo hi**

***Daṇḍa-rūpeṇa** **Brahmaṇā nirmitaḥ þura***), says ***Yājñavalkya***: "God created for his (i.e., the king's) sake in the remote past. His own son, Daṇḍa, as the protector of all living beings, as an incarnation of Dharma and created of God's glory, declares Manu ([VII, 14](# "तस्यार्थे सर्वभूतानां गोप्तारं धर्ममात्मजम् । ब्रह्मतेजोमयं दण्डमसृजत्पूर्वमीश्वरः ॥")).The elaborate panegyric on Daṇḍa in *Manusmṛti* (VII, 15-31) identifies the Spirit of Punishment with Dharma, and declares that Daṇḍa will destroy the king who swerves from the path of Dharma along with his kinsmen, kingdom and all his possessions. ([lb. VII, 28-29](# " दण्डो हि सुमहत्तेजो दुर्धरश्चाकृतात्मभिः ।धर्माद्विचलितं हन्ति नृपमेव सबान्धवम् ॥    ततो दुर्गं चराष्ट्रं च लोकं च सचराचरम् । अन्तरिक्षगतांश्चैव मुनीन्देवांश्च पीडयेत्॥")).The twin concepts have thus a contitutional implication. The king is supreme and must be obeyed, because he holds a position that is of divine creation. At the same time, he is able to assert his authority solely because he is supported by the divinely created power of chastisement of the unrighteous. When the king is himself unrighteous and strays away from the path of duty, the power which upholds his authority will turn against him and destroy him. The king is king by right divine, but he is king only so long as he rules according to Dharma. Oppression cannot plead divine sanction. So great a power in a king entails a corresponding responsibility. Its safe and salutary exercise is possible only for a ruler who has proper counsel, and who possesses the necessary intellectual, educational and moral qualifications. A king who takes no counsel, who is a fool, who is covelous, who is a sensualist and whose mind remains unimproved is unfit to exercise the power with safety to [himself](# "सोऽसहायेन मूढेन लुब्धेनाकृतबुद्धिना । न शक्यो न्यायतो नेतुं सक्तेन विषयेषु च ॥").(Ib. VII, 30). The autocrat is provided with external and internal checks to the capricious exercise of his authority by the imposition of assistants in administration and by the compulsion to educate himself. The elaborate catalogue of the good qualities that a king should possess (***rājaguṇāḥ***) in the ***smṛtis***, which is condensed in a separate chapter by Lakṣmīdhara (ch. 3), is followed up by another catalogue of vices or bad habits, (***rājavyasana***) which kings are prone to and should avoid (pp. 142-148, ***infra***), and the citation of legendary instances of kings, who by

disciplined lives attained greatness and fame, or were 'lost' (***vinaṣṭāḥ***) by unrestrained (***a-vinaya***) indulgence in the vices (Ib. p. 157). The specification of these qualifications to the apparent absolutism of the divinely created kingship both at the beginning and at the end of his treatment of the seven elements of the state (***saptāṅga***) by an official like Lakṣmīdhara is noteworthy.



EVOLUTION OF THE DIVINE RIGHT IDEA

  The concept of evolution is foreign to a political thought, which is founded on a belief in its being part of a revealed and eternal order. But, modern criticism can note the chief stages in the transformation of a kingship of purely human origin into one of divine creation. The ***Aitareya Brāhmaṇa*** (I, 14) shows how, as elsewhere in the world, war begat the [king](# "देवासुरा वा एषु लोकेषु समयतन्त । . . . तांस्ततोऽसुराऽजयन् . . .देवा अब्रुवन् न राजतया वैनो जयन्ति । राजानं करवामहाइति । तथेति ते सोमं राजानमकुर्वन् । तै सोमेन राज्ञा सर्वादिशो जयन् ।(p. 10. Haug's ed.)").The leader in war becomes the king in civil life. The theory of the contractual origin of kingship, fore-shadowed in the epic, the ***Manusmṛti***, the ***Arthaśāstra*** and Buddhist literature, reflects the birth of kingship from the need to end internal chaos. The election of the king is incomplete without the mystic ceremony of ***abhiṣeeana*** (sprinkling) by which certain qualities necessary for kingship are instilled into the person selected as ruler, as the result of prayers to certain deities. "Savitā is prayed for energy, the family fire (***gārhaþatya-agni***) for domestic virtues, Soma for power to protect forests, ***Bṛhaspati*** for eloquence, Indra for ruling capacity, Rudra for power to protect cattle-wealth, Mitra for truth, and lastly, ***Varuṇa*** for protection of [law](# "Jayaswal, Hindu Polity, 1924, ii, 23.")."In the different duties of the king, a resemblance to the well-known functions or powers associated with divine beings is noticed. The parity of functions between the divinities and the mortal ruler is first stated, in the familiar form adopted for vivid expression, in similes. He burns (***tapati***) the eyes and hearts of his enemies or the enemies of law-like Āditya (the Sun). He showers blessings on the kingdom, as Indra sends rains. He

does the work of the Sun (***arka-vratam caran***) when, like the Sun, he draws the moisture from the earth, in the form of taxes. As, Vāyu, the wind-god, permeates the world, so he pervades the kingdom through his spies. As Yama pulls up friends or enemies equally, when their time is up, so he has to control every one in the kingdom impartially. And so forth. Every writer sees some resemblance between the king's functions and those of gods. From this recognition of similarity, it is only a step farther to assuming that in discharging various functions the king is performing vows to the different gods to whom the functions are appropriate. The simile then turns to metaphor. The king is not merely ***like*** the various divinities, but he is the quintessence of divinity. The particles of divine essence adhere to the king. A temporary god-hood comes to the king at some of the great sacrifices, like the ***Vājapeya*** and the ***Rājasūya***. It is only a step forward from this idea to that of a king being a divinity all the time, once the consecration is over. The god-like king has become a god. The mystic power of certain rites to transform a man, making a common person a semi-divine ruler, making a regenerate person of one who is not ***upanīta***, and even making a human being a divinity, is widely credited in primitive society, and the belief persists even when the community advances in culture or becomes [sophisticated](# "The sacrificer dies mystically and is reborn as a King ; see A. K. Coomaraswamy, Spiritual Authority and Temporal Power in the Indian Theory of Government (A.O.S., 1942), p. 10 and A.M. Hocart, Kingship, 1927, ch. I, passim.").



THE DIVINE RIGHT IDEA IN DHARMAŚĀSTRA

  The different stages in the development of the idea of the king-god are not perceptible in Dharmaśāstra. Its writers could have been hardly conscious of it. The fallibility and the manifest vices or weaknesses of consecrated kings would open every one's eyes to the weakness of the divinity idea, when construed literally. The twin hypotheses of the divine creation of both kingship and the power of punishment, without which monarchy is ineffective and powerless, showed a way out. It is kingship, or political union, as we would put it, which is divine, not the person of the king. There is no "right divine to do wrong" in any king. Misgovernment leads to the elimination

of the king but not of kingship. *The king is the state* but, in only one sense : he takes the entire responsibility for all administrative acts of commission and omission. It is only through his negligence or lack of power that subjects can err ; he must accordingly share in the guilt and the sin. He must make good stolen property which he is unable to recover and restore to the owners. The ultimate responsibility for miscarriage of justice in the courts is the king's. Even for seasonal vicissitudes and calamities of nature his is the responsibility. The awful burden cannot be shifted on by the king to any one else. He makes his age, raising or lowering its tone by his actions, (***rājākālasya kāraṇam***).



EXALTATION OF THE KING

  Position and power go with responsibility. The exaltation of the office and person of the king in the epics and in ***smṛtis*** meets this logical requirement. Not only **Nārada**, who is commonly (and wrongly) supposed to be the advocate of absolutism, but Manu (***infra***, pp. 4-7) exalts the office and person of the king in terms, which, construed literally and without reference to literary nuances and the context, would appear to be an advocacy of autocratic rule! A king, who is a boy, should not be slighted because he is a mere boy, for he is a mighty god in human form says Manu (VII, 8). "Wealth springs from his favor, victory from his prowess in war, death from his [anger](# "Cf. Raghuvamsa, IV, 12 -  यथा प्रह्लादनाचन्द्रः प्रतापासपनो यथा । तथैव सोऽभूदन्वर्थो राजा प्रकृतिरञ्जनात् ॥")." His acts of favor towards those who are attached to him, and of ill will towards those whom he dislikes should not be questioned, adds Manu. But, immediately below this sweeping claim, Lakṣmīdhara cites the words of Manu (***inf***. p. 6) declaring that Daṇḍa is Dharma, whose unsleeping vigils guard subjects and punish their derelictions. The king is called ***Rājā***because he pleases the subjects ([***rañjayati prajāḥ***](# "The etymology, though now scouted,is old and is found in Yāska.")).The king is like the teacher to his subjects, because he reforms offenders and frees them from sin by

punishing them and at the same time protects them. Penal law is corrective and reformative and not retributory.

  But such statements as that 'while fire scorches only the person who approaches it too close, the anger of the king destroys the person against whom it is directed along with his family and property,' (***inf***. p. 6) have a realistic touch. The sudden outbursts of a wayward and passionate ruler are not controllable by a mere reference to Dharma. It is best to avoid the king's anger. It will be poor consolation to the unlucky person, who has irritated the king, to know that Kātyāyana (***inf***. p. 155) declared that the king who, without properly understanding a matter, flies into a rage pays for it by detention for half a kalpa in Hell ! The ruler's moods must be studied. His pleasure and displeasure are serious things to those who are about him. The long extract from ***Matsyapurāṇa***, which Lakṣmīdhara has given (pp. 34-38), on the deportment of royal servants (***anujīvi-vṛttam***) is half code of court etiquette, half worldly wisdom addressed to those who minister to an absolute ruler. There is real risk in telling a wholesome but unpalatable truth to a king, and the flatterer, who echoes a king's sentiments, is commoner than the loyal servant who speaks an unwanted truth (***inf***. p. 106).

  For all state decisions the king takes sole responsibility. He has to consult ministers and obtain their advice, but their function is merely advisory. He is discouraged from open discussions of important questions of policy with many ministers or to decide them alone (***inf***. p. 104). Such a lonely position ***sometimes*** acts as a corrective to absolutism. The consultation with departmental experts, described in ch. 4, and with the council of ministers (ch. 12) will act as a brake on impulsive royal action. The qualifications laid down for ministers and councillors will ordinarily ensure that the advice tendered is based on knowledge, experience, loyalty to the king and faith in Dharma.

  The passages in ***Nāradasmṛti***, which are reproduced (pp. 4-5 ***infra***) represent the exaltation of the king in an extreme form, in a way not quite in harmony with the views expressed by Nārada in other parts of the ***smṛti***. The king is described as without beginning and without end (like the Supreme Being) and is therefore beyond criticism unless he deviates from the prescribed rules of conduct (***padacyutaḥ, i.e. bhraṣṭācāraḥ***). The qualification

is noteworthy."What he decrees, just or unjust, settles the law between litigants." (p. 5 ***inf***.) The real implication is - not that an unjust decision of the king ceases to be so because it emanates from him, but -there should be finality attaching to the decision of the highest judge in the state. Recognized customs (***cāritra***) are proclaimed by the king in order that there may be some fixity in affairs (***sthityartham***). As a good wife is devoted to even a worthless husband, so the subjects should be loyal, ***i.e***., obedient, even to an unworthy ruler (p. 5). The emphasis in the passage is on the need for stability in affairs and finality in decisions such as can ensue only from an executive authority whose every act is not liable to be called into question. Such exaggerated statements are common in Dharmaśāstra, but they are made, following a literary convention, merely to emphasise a point, and can not be constructed literally.

  The constitutional position of the king ***vis a vis*** the subject, in theory and practice, can be discovered only after a review of the entire body of arrangements for conducting the affairs of the kingdom. We shall revert to the subject later.



WHO CAN BE KING?

  The ***varṇāsrama*** scheme does not contemplate non-Kṣatriya kingship. Manu interdicts residence in the dominions of a S'ūdra king ([IV, 61](# "न शूत्रराज्ये निवसेन्नाधार्मिकजनावृत्ते ।")).He prohibits a S'ūdra deciding Dharma as a judge or assessor ([VIII, 20-21](# "धर्मप्रवक्ता नृपते र्न तु शूद्रःकथञ्चन ।यस्य शूद्रस्तु कुरुते राज्ञः धर्मविवेचनम् । तस्य सीदति तद्राष्ट्रं पङ्के गौरिव पश्यतः ।")).If a ***considerable*** area of India was under Śūdra rule, when the present ***Manusmṛti*** was composed, such an interdict could not have been made. The Purāṇas declare that Kṣatriya rule ends when the Nandas ceased to [rule](# " नन्दान्तं क्षत्रिय कुलम् ।").Though the expression ***rājā***in ***Manusmṛti***, VII, 1, has been declared by Medhātithi not to refer exclusively to a [***Kṣatriya***](# "“राजशब्दस्तु नेह क्षत्रियजातिवचनः किं तर्हि अभिषेकादिगुणयोगिनि पुरुषं वर्तते ” (VII, 1) but in explaining ' क्षत्रियेण यथा विधि ’in VII, 2, Medhātitḥi adds—"),

in the very next verse the two words are used as

synonyms. The entire trend of the ***smṛtis*** is to insist on ***kṣatriyas*** alone being entitled to be kings. This view is upheld by Mitramiśra and Nīlakanṭha Bhatta, while Caṇḍeśvara and Aparārka hold that any person, who is ***de facto*** king, can be called ***rājā***. Mādhavācārya also maintains that only a ***kṣatriya*** can be consecrated as [king](# "Mitramiśra's patron Bir Singh of Orecha claimed to be a kṣatriya. In the maṅgala-ślokas prefixed to his commentary on Parāsara-smṛti Mādhava refers to his patron only as Kṣmāpatiḥ, while attributing to him all kingly qualities.").Not only in ***Manusmṛti*** but in ***Kāmandakīya Nītisāra*** the terms ***rājā*** and ***kṣatriya*** are used as synonyms. Caṇḍeśvara tacitly accepts the position by omitting to treat of ***abhiṣeka***. Lakṣmīdhara does not raise the point at all, but the drift of his treatment is to confine lawful kingship to men of the ***kṣatriya*** caste. His king claimed to be a Rajput. The general attitude of Lakṣmīdhara is conservative. From his citing only the descriptions of coronations from the ***Brahmapurāṇa*** and the ***Rāmāyaṇa*** no inference can be drawn against this view. The two accounts paraphrase, as ***Purāṇas*** often do, the Vedic ritual. It is Lakṣmīdhara's practice to indicate briefly the ***mantras*** to be used in such rites and leave the ***prayoga*** to the qualified priests who would officiate. In the seventeenth century the point came to the fore again in the claims of Śivāji to be crowned and of Savāi Jaisingh of Amber to perform the ***Aśvamedha*** sacrifice.

  The injunctions of Rājadharma are held to be 'binding on every one who actually exercises the functions of a king, independently of his caste. The view is apparently old and conferred on kings ***de facto***, who accepted the Brahmanic system the rights in regard to the performance of Vedic sacrifices, which only ***kṣatriyas***were under a strict construction entitled to. When a powerful ruler set up a claim to belong to the ***kṣatriya*** caste, it was neither wise nor expedient to dispute it. The retention of sections on coronation in works on Rājadharma composed in the epoch of Muslim rule in India is to be explained on the ground that even tributary kings must, if duly qualified, undergo the rite, before they could strictly claim to be Rājas.

“क्षत्रियेणेति—एतेन क्षत्रिय एव राज्याधिकारीति सूचितम्। क्षत्रियाभावे तदतिदेशोऽपि ग्राह्यः। अन्यथा प्रजालोपस्स्यादिति भावः "।  


**THE ROYAL CORONATION**

  In Indian theory the right to protect the subjects and other contingent rights devolve only on a duly ***crowned*** ruler. In the ***Matsyapurāṇa***, cited by the ***Vīramitrodaya***, this is expressly stated. The kingdom vests in the ruler only after his head is wet with the water of ***abhiṣeka*** ([***abhiṣekārdra śirasā***](# "राज्ञोऽभिषिक्तमात्रस्य किं नु कृत्यतमं भवेत् ।  अत्र मात्रपदेन तं अपा च अभिषेकानन्तरमेव प्रजापालनं तदङ्गसंपत्तिश्च संपादनीयेति गम्यते । तदुक्तं तत्रैव —  अभिषेकार्द्रशिरसा राज्ञा राज्यावलोकिना । सहायवरणं कार्यं तत्र राज्यं प्रतिष्ठितम् ॥")),and he can proceed to appoint his ministers (*Ib*. p. 13). The term ***Rājā***is interpreted only in the sense of "the anointed ***kṣatriya***" (***rājā abhṣikta kṣatriyaḥ***). Vijñāneśvara prefaces his treatment of ***rājadharma*** with the remark : "Having spoken of the ordinary duties of the householder, he (***i.e***., Yājñavalkya) proceeds to speak of the special duties of the householder (***kṣatriya***) who has undergone [***rājyabhiṣeka***](# "309 - साधरणान् गृहस्थधर्मानुक्त्वेदानीं राज्याभिषेकादिगुणयुक्तस्य गृहस्थस्य विशेषधर्मानाह । (मिताक्षरा) ।")."Bhaṭṭa Nīlakanṭha similarly holds that the legal acquisition of kingship dates only after the [***abhiṣeka***](# "अभिषेकोत्तरभाविराज्ययोगात् प्रागपि राजानमभिषिञ्चेत् इत्यादेः शास्त्रीयप्रयोगस्य क्षत्रियमात्रेऽपि सद्भावादिति विरणाय्यवेष्ट्यधिकरणे । (नीतिमयूखः, पृ. १.)").In the ***Atharvaṇa-parisiṣṭha***, after describing the ritual of ***puspābhiṣeka*** in coronation, it is stated that the king, who has had a lustral bath after coronation, proceeds to enjoy the [earth](# "राजा स्नातो महीं भुङ्ते(वी. मि. प्र. ११४) ।").⁴

Anantadeva states categorically that the use of the word ***Rājā***in reference to a ruler is inappropriate before the [coronation](# "अभिषेकात्पूर्वमपि राजशब्दो नानुपपन्नः, अवेष्ट्याधिकरणन्यायेन जातिवाचकत्वात्' । (पृ. ३३८.) It is noteworthy that Aśoka counts his reign from B.c. 269, the date of his abhiṣeka.").

It is noteworthy that in the coronation ritual described in ***Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa*** the king-elect is described only by the pronoun "he" and that it is only after the ceremony of ***abhiṣecana*** (sprinkling) is completed that he becomes invested with the royal powers and office and is called ***Rājā***([king](# "Jayaswal, Hindu Polity, II, p 15.")). The position is upheld by

***Manusmṛti*** (VII, 2) which rules that the protection of the kingdom in accordance with justice should be undertaken by the ***k******ṣ******atriya*** who has been consecrated according to the prescribed rites by the ***Brāhmaṇa*** (***i.e., rājyābhiṣeka***). A prince might be made to undergo the ***abhiṣeka*** in the lifetime of his predecessor, either as a ***yuvarāja***, as was arranged in the case of Śri Rāma, or as co-king. An ***abhiṣeka*** could be done only at an auspicious moment (***inf***. p. 9). Months might clapse before the Court Astrologer, (***sāmvatsarikaḥ***), who becomes an important functionary on this account and who officiates as such at the coronation, can find an auspicious date for the commencement of the ceremonies leading to the ***abhiṣeka***. What was to happen in the interval between the death of a king and the coronation of his successor ? Lakṣmidhara does not answer the question. Bhaṭṭa Nīlakanṭha's opinion, based on the ***Viṣṇudharmottara***, is that on the death of a king his successor should, without delay and without any attention to the auspiciousness of the moment, be bathed in ***tila*** and ***sarpis***, according to ritual, be seated on a throne different from that used by the dead king, be proclaimed as king by the Court Astrologer and Chicf Priest (***sāmvatsara-purohitau***) and exhibited to the people as the new king. The new reign would begin at once, but the ruler will await the arrival of the auspicious time for his consecration as [kīng](# "अत्र यदा पूर्वराजनि मृते, अन्योऽभिषिच्यते, तदाऽसौ तिलसर्षपस्नानाद्यभयघोषान्ते कृते, अन्यासनस्थः, प्रजाःपालयन् अभिषेककालमाकांक्षेत् । (पृ. ५.)").That an interval would usually occur between succession and consecration is evident from the rule of Vasiṣṭha (II, 49) declaring a ***moratorium*** on debts in the [interval](# "राजा तु मृतभावेन द्रव्यवृद्धिं विनाशयेत् । पुना राजाभिषेकेण द्रव्यमूलं च वर्द्धते ॥").We know that an interval of about four years occurred between the succession and consecration of [Aśoka](# "J.M. Macphail, Aśoka, p 19 ; Cambridge History of India, I, p. 503.").Kharavela of Kaliṅga states in the Hathigumpha inscription that he was installed (consecrated) as ***yuvarāja***, when his period of adolescence was over in his sixteenth year, and that he was a ***yuvarāja*** for nine years, getting consecrated by the ***Mahārāja-abhiṣecanam*** at the end of his twenty-fourth [year](# "Journal of the Bihar and Orissa Research Society, III, (1917), pp. 425-507,").

Mr. K. P. Jayaswal thinks that the throne was vacant before his consecration as Mahārāja,

or to give the title used by the queen, as [Kalinga-Cakravartin](# "Ibid., p. 438. For the title, see Epigraphia Indioa, XIII, p. 159.").Dr. Jayaswal reads a rule into this supposed delay of the consecration as king, ***viz***., that a king could not be given his ***abhiṣeka*** till his twenty-fourth [year](# "Hindu Polity, II, p. 52."). The suggestion is unsupported by any rule of public law in India. Hindu Law makes no distinction as regards the age of majority between kings and private persons. It is sixtcen for both. Kharavela was installed as ***yuvarāja*** as soon as he reached the age for majority. The public inconvenience of a long interval between accession and coronation would work against its prolongation. The long delay in the case of Aśoka has yet to be satisfactorily explained. Buddhist and Jain rulers, like Brahmanical kings accept the dictates of astrology. Among the Coļa kings the reign of one who had been installed as ***yuvarāja*** was dated from the date of such inauguration. The purpose of the installation was obviously to overcome the risks attending uncertainty as to who should succeed, when there was more than one grown-up [prince](# "K. A, Nilakanta Sastri, - The Colas, I, 1935, p. 13."). As a regal inheritance could not be divided, the ordinary private law of succession to property could not be applied. The training of a grown-up ***yuvarāja*** in administration, rising from the exercise of minor authority to the highest positions in the kingdom, is recommended in the passage from the ***Matsyapurāṇa***, which takes up most of the small section (***inf***. p. 100) that Lakṣmīdhara has set apart for the 'guarding of the prince.' (***rājaputra-rakṣā***).



**ŚIVĀJI'S CORONATION**

  The belief that a Hindu ruler could not be deemed to be fully entitled to recognition till he had undergone the ***abhiṣeka*** is illustrated by the famous 'coronation' of Śivāji in 1674, when for many years he had been recognized as a powerful and independent ruler. As he claimed to be a ***kṣatriya***, descended from the kings of Mewar, his failure to undergo ***upanayana*** within the age limits prescribed for the ***samskāra*** in the case of ***kṣatriyas***had made him a ***vrātya***. His purification and rehabilitation had therefore to precede his ***abhiṣeka***, which was conducted, according

to the rites prescribed, under the supervision of Viśveśvara Bhaṭṭa of Kāśī, familiarly known as Gāgā Bhat. Śivāji is said to have gone through the ***abhiśeka***, because many old sardars of Mahārāṣtra professed to be his equals in rank and refused to sit below him even in his own Darbars (Sivadigvijaya, pp. 406-408). The ***abhiśeka*** established his right to ***simhāsana*** and ***chatra***, and he took the title of ***Chatrapati*** from the date of its performance, June 6, 1674 (Jyeṣṭa Śuddha Trayodaśī, Śaka 1596). The coronation was followed by a ***tulāpuruṣa-dāna***, and his weight in gold coins was distributed among the Brāhmaṇas who had flocked to the [ceremony](# " See Sivadigvijaya, pp. 406-408 in S. N. Sen's Sivachhatrapati, 1920, pp. 241-242, and Kincaid and Parasnis - History of the Marathas, 1931, pp. 92-94,").



**THE RITUAL OF CORONATION**

  The word 'coronation is used here, following the western usage, for the formal ceremony, though the 'crown' has no prominent place in the ceremonial. The act of sprinkling or ***abhiśeka*** is the vital act of the ritual. After the sprinkling and a bath following it, the prince has the crown placed on his head (***ābaddha-makuṭaḥ***) and the fillet of gold tied round his forehead (***baddha-paṭṭah***). Then, with garlands placed on his neck, as a sign of the completion of the ceremony, he has to sec one-hundred-and-eight holy objects (***puṇyam aṣṭottaram śatam***) and one hundred auspicious things (***mangaļānām śatampaśyet***). The crown is not among the articles neededfor the installation of ŚrīRāma as ***yuvarāja***, which are described in the ***Rāmāyaṇa***, as collected and kept by the royal priest Vasiṣṭha for use on the occasion.

  The rites described in Vedic ***Brāhmaṇas*** are designed to endow the personage selected for the office of king with the attributes and power required for kingship. A ruler may have been selected but before he can function as a proper king (***rājā***) he must undergo the ceremony, in which he is said to be 'born.' It is therefore a ***rājasūya***. Among the great Vedic sacrifices two, ***viz***., the ***Vājapeya*** and the ***Rājasūya***, were indicated for performance by ***kṣatriyas***, who desired universal dominion and kingship respectively. They were not parts

really of the ceremony of the installation of a king. But, apparently, one who was already a ruler gained in splendour, majesty and superhuman power by performing them. The ordinary ceremony of installation of the king was also a ***rājasūya***, because the king was ceremonially 'born' of it, but the two must be distinguished. The sacrifice of ***Rājasūya*** took about two years to finish, and was therefore a ***dīrgha-sattra***. The installation ceremony, on the other hand, lasted only some days.

  The Vedic form of the ceremony had apparently gone out of use, and simpler rites, which repeated parts of the-old ritual, were in use. They are described in the Purāṇas and the epics. In the ***Rāmāyaṇa*** there are descriptions of one half-completed ***abhiṣeha*** and of Śri Rāma's final coronation, as well as a reference to the ***abhiṣeha*** of his sandals by Bharata. The last merely mentions that Bharata, having got the sandals sprinkled (***abhiṣicya***), himself held over them the umbrella (***chatra***) and wielded the fly-whisk ([***cāmara***](# "Ayodhyākāṇḍa, ch. 115, sl. 25.")). The arrangements for the ***abhiṣeha*** of Śri Rāma as his father's assistant, in the capacity of ***yuvarājā***, are described in the first six chapters of the ***Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa***. The relevant parts of these descriptions have been reproduced by Lakṣmīdhara. (***inf***. pp. 12-17). In the concluding chapter of ***Yuddha-kāṇḍa*** there is a very brief description of Śri Rāma's final [coronation](# "Ch. 131, sl. 59-71."). The last passage states that the hero was sprinkled with scented water, brought from the four oceans in golden pots, by the ṛtviks and the assembled Brāhmaṇas first, and then by virgins, ministers, and warriors, to the accompaniment of Vedic rites (***sa-naigamaiḥ***). The gods who had all assembled in the heavens at the moment and the divine guardians of the four quarters sprinkled him with the juice of every medicinal plant. Vasiṣṭha then seated Śri Rāma on a jewelled stool (***nānāratnamaye pīṭhe***) and placed the crown of the dynasty on his head. The officiating priests (***ṛṭviks***) adorned him with jewelled ornaments. Śatrughna held over the king's head the white umbrella, the two white fly-whisks (***cāmara***) were handled by Sugrīva and Vibhīṣaṇa. The ceremony was concluded by the presentation of diverse gifts to

his allies by the hero. The context suggests that the entire ceremony was begun and concluded in one day.



THE PROBLEM OF SUCCESSION

  The ***abhiṣeka*** of a ***yuvarāja*** was apparently by the same rites as of a king. The anangements upto the day of ***abhiṣeka*** are described in the ***Ayodhyā-kāṇḍa***. The first step was to choose the person for ***abhiṣeka***. The heir-apparent to be crowned as ***yuvarāja*** has to be selected for the possession of the qualifications, which are indicated in Daśaratha's words to Śri Rāma, when he was called up to hear of his ***abhiṣeka*** as ***yuvarāja*** (***inf***. p. 17). Śri Rāma's fitness for the installation is illustrated by his being the eldest son, by the seniormost queen, whose lineage was equal to that of the king, by his pre-eminent virtues, by the king's affection for him and by his pleasing qualities, which had made him universally popular. The implications of the passage are that the successor to the throne should be an ***aurasa*** son, be the oldest of such sons, be dear to the king and popular with the subjects, owing to his virtues. Lakṣmīdhara does not categorically state that he eldest son succeeds automatically. His citing this passage suggests that in his view more seniority, untempered by merit and popularity, is insufficient. Manu declares that seniority among sons does not follow seniority among their respective [mothers](# "सदृशस्त्रीषु जातानां पुत्राणामविशेषतः ।    न मातृतो ज्यैष्ठ्यमस्ति जन्मतो ज्यैष्ठ्यमुच्यते ॥ (९, १२५).").The ***Kālikāpurāṇa*** does not give an unqualified rule of primogeniture among princes, as supposed by Mitramisra, as it insists on the eldest son being an ***aurasa*** endowed with all kingly qualities (***sarvarājaguṇair vṛtam***). [Kauṭilya](# "कालिकापुराणे तु ज्येष्ठौरसस्य राज्यं स्पष्टमेव अभिहितम् - अथोपरिचरं राजा यौवराज्येऽभ्यषेचयेत् । ज्यायांसमौरसं पुत्रं सर्वराजगुणैर्युतम् ॥ इति राजनीतिप्रकाशे (पु. ३६).")rules that except in order to get over a crisis, kingship is the right of the eldest son. [Kāmandaka](# "अन्यत्रापदि ऐश्वर्यं ज्येष्ठभागी तु पूज्यते (३, १, १७)."),who almost invariably follows Kauṭilya, does not refer to the eldest son's installation as ***yuvarāja*** and only says that an ***aurasa*** son, who is well-disciplined (***vinīta***)

should be [selected](# "विनीतमौरसं पुत्रं यौवराज्येऽभिषेचयेत् । (७, ६).").Caṇḍeśvara, who discusses the question, cites the views of Nārada, Śukra and Bṛhaspati, as set forth in their books on Nītiśāstra, that the eldest son should succeed to a kingdom, even though there may be a better endowed younger son ([p. 70](# "राज्यमदत्वैव राज्ञिमृते राजपुत्राय पुरोहितमन्त्रिभिरपि राज्यं दातव्यं वैदिकलौकिकर्मसु राजप्रातिनिध्यात् । बहुषु ज्येष्ठाय इति सम्प्रदायः । ननु राजपरोक्षे राजपुत्रस्यैव कथं तैर्दातव्यमिति चेन्न । तैरेव न ग्राह्यमधर्मश्रवणादित्यभिप्रायात् । 'अत्र विवादपरिहारार्थमिति' लक्ष्मीधरः । राज्यभङ्गभियेति पल्लवकारः । . . . राजनीतौ शुक्रः -  राज्यं पुरोविवाहं च सपिण्डीकरणं पितुः । गुणवत्सु कनिष्ठेषु ज्येष्ठ एव समर्हति ॥                                      इति राजनीतिरत्नाकरे, पृ. ७०.")).The printed ***Śukranītisāra*** gives a king, on the other hand, the option to appoint (in this order) as ***yuvarāja*** an ***aurasa*** son, a younger brother, a younger cousin, or an elder brother's son, any son, a grandson who has been made a son, (***putrīkṛta***) and an adopted son. The rule of primogeniture seems recommendatory, not mandatory. The old elective kingship of the Vedic age had given place to the hereditary monarchy of the epic period. The search for popular approval of the selection of a successor must have then been dictated by prudence rather than by law. Daśaratha was able to leave the throne, like personal property, to Bharata, in redemption of an old pledge, in the tecth of universal disapproval, and the kingdom had to be given back to the lawful heir by [Bharata](# "शिरस्याञ्जलिमाधाय कैकेय्यानन्दवर्धनः ।  बभाषे भरतो ज्येष्ठं रामं सत्यपराक्रमम् ॥  पूजिता मामिका माता दत्तं राज्यमिदं मम ।  तद्ददामि पुनस्तुभ्यं यथात्वमददा मम ॥                 (युद्धकाण्ड, १३१, १, २).").



**EPIC RITUAL OF ABIIIṢEKA**

  The coronation rites of the ***Rāmāyaṇa*** fall into five clearly marked stages. The first stage is represented by the selection of the heir-apparent for ***abhiṣeka***. The popular approval of it is expressed by acclamation (***janaghoṣa***). The next stage witnesses first, the selection of auspicious time for the commencement of the ceremonies and of another for the actual, crucial

ceremony of ***abhiṣeka***, and next the collection of the necessary materials and of the men who are to officiate at the functions. The third stage sees the prince go through his own purification and preparation for the ***abhiṣeka***. The fourth is the ***abhiṣekakṛtya*** with its ***pūrvāṅga***, which are barely hinted at. The post-***abhiṣeka*** duties take up the last stage. The description is incomplete in the ***Rāmāyaṇa***, as Śrī Rāma did not pass through the last two stages for the ***yuvarājyābhiṣeka***. Daśaratha himself announces the auspicious time for the [event](# "चैत्रः श्रीमानयं मासःपुण्यः पुष्पितकाननः । यौवराज्याय रामस्य सर्वमेवोपकल्प्यताम् ॥                  (अयोध्याकाण्ड, ३, ४).").The preliminary arrangements include the decoration of the palaces and the capital, the assembling of festive crowds, the collection of gold, precious stones and jewels, white garlands, fried rice, ***madhu*** and ***sarpis***, all usual weapons, untorn raiment ***(ahatāni-vastrāṇi***), a white charger, an elephant with auspicious marks, a chariot, a pair of fly-whisks (***cāmara***) a flag, a white umbrella, one hundred golden pots, a bull with horns tipped with gold, a complete tiger-skin and the various articles required for ***homa***. In addition, there were procured for the occasion water from the confluence of the Ganges and the Jumua at Prayāg and from other holy streams, a palanquin borne on the shoulders of men, 'all seeds' and sconts, pots full of ***gorocanã***, curds, clarified butter and honey, oight virgins decked in ornaments, hacterae, a cow, a lion-throne (***simhāsana***), ***kuśa grass*** and ***samit*** for the sacred fire, all musical instruments and performers, holy birds and animals of auspicious appearance, citizens in their guilds, and learned Brāhmaṇas. Śrī Rāma passes the third stage in propitiation of the sacred fire, worship of Viṣṇu, consuming the remnants of the fire-offering and observing a fast, lying on ***kuśa*** spread on the ground, in company with his consort. The articles collected include regalia and "auspicious" objects.



**THE PURĀṆIC RITUAL**

  Two excerpts, a shorter one from the ***Brahmapurāṇa*** and a longer one from ***Viṣnudharmottara***, are given by Mitramiśra,

Bhaṭṭa Nīlakanṭha and Anantadeva, while the first alone is given by Lakṣmīdhara. The Purāṇic ritual is an elaboration of that in the ***Rāmāyaṇa***. After the proper dates for the beginning of the ceremonies and for the ***abhiṣeka***proper are settled in the consultation with the astrologer (***Sāmvatsarika***) of the court, a chief priest is chosen to direct the rites. He was not to be the chief priest of any other [ruler](# "'अत्र पुरोहितग्रहणमन्यराजपुरोहितो न ग्राह्यः' । (राजधर्मकौस्तुभे, पृ, २४२).").Then a preceptor (***guru***) was to be invited for the occasion. The persons who should officiate as well as the various articles needed and collected had to be inspected by the prince. The queen should be sprinkled along with the king, if the latter is already married at the time of the installation. If he marries later, the chief queen has a subsequent [***abhiṣeka***](# " राज्ञा सह अग्रमहिषी अभिषेक्तव्या अथवा अभिषिक्तेन राज्ञा पश्चात् स्वयमभिषेक्तव्या ॥ (रा. कौ. २४८).").A chief minister (***mantrin***) should be chosen to officiate on the occasion. As seven or eight ministers are indicated for daily consultation, the appointment of this full number of ministers is also deemed necessary. It was done by Śivāji, when he appointed the ***aṣtapradān*** before his coronation and mado them officiate at it.

  The ceremonics begin with various preliminary and propitiatory rites, like ***Vināyakasānti*** to overcome obstacles, ***Grahaśānti*** and ***Nakṣatraśānti*** (propitiation of the planetary and stellar deities), ***Abhyudaya-srāddha*** (to propitiate ***pitaraḥ***) and ***Aindrī***-***śānti***, to overcome internal and external enemies. These should ordinarily take seven days, during which the prince should fast and also observe continence. Before the ***Aindrī***-***śānti*** is done the worship of Viṣṇu(***Nārāyaṇa-pūjā***), the worship of the Divine Mothers (***Mātṛkā***-***pūjā***) and ***Vasordhārā*** (the ritual for which is given by Lakṣmīdhara in the concluding chapter of the book) as well as ***svastivācakam*** and ***anumati*** (or sanction by the assembled Brāhmaṇas) must be finished.

  On the day of the ***abhiṣeka***the priest should decorate himself with a turban and ear rings, begin the ceremonies and proceed to propitiate the sacred fire with offerings to the accompaniment of thirteen specified hymns (***inf***. p. 10).

  The prince, who has already had a bath, should again be bathed 'like a god' (***deva-vat***) with ***pañcagavya*** and with water,

milk, curds, and nectar (***amṛta***), in pots of earth, copper, silver and gold, by a Śūdra, standing to the west of the prince, by a Vaiśya standing to the south, by a Kṣatriya standing to the east, and by a Brāhmaṇa standing to the north. Earth collected from twelve different localities (a hill, an ant-hill, the temple of Indra, the king's palace, a temple, anywhere but lifted by an elephant with its tusk and by an ox with its horn, the house of a prostitute, the confluence of a stream, a horse stable, a cow-shed and a river bed) should be used to rub him on various parts of his body. The prince should then be conducted by the priest to his couch (***bhadrāsana***), made of a tree yielding a milk-white sap, and seated on it. He should then have water sprinkled on him by members of the four castes, by chaste women and by women with living children. This finishes the ***abhiṣeka***. When water is poured on him, it should be through a golden sieve having a hundred-and-cight holes, and the prince should stand all the time on a plate similarly bored. The crown (***mukuṭa***) should then be placed on his head, a fillet of gold, in the shape of a headcovering, should be tied to his forehead, and he should be garlanded and decorated. When this was donc, he should gaze on 100 auspicious objects, and 108 holy articles. After finishing any other Vedic rites that remain, and fed the sacred fire, he should bestow on the fire the ***purṇāhuti***. He should next worship Gaṇeśa again as well as Brahmā, Visṇu and Śiva. In their honor and for the satisfaction of the planets, the gods and the manes, he should bestow gifts. He should convey an assurance of freedom from fear (***abhaya***) to all living beings. He should release cows. He should then be seated by the Chief Priest on a lion-throne covered with a tiger skin. Having worshipped his weapons and regalia, he should give ***darsana*** to his subjects. After this is done, he should mount an elephant, make a circuit of the capital, return to the palace, feed the guests and royal servants, when taking his own food. Next, having rinsed his mouth (***ācamya***), partaken of betel, he should enter the inner apartments and refresh himself again. So ends the coronation.

  The details given above are added to by the ***Viṣnudharmottara***. The additions to the ritual described by Lakṣmīdhara may now be noted. After the sprinkling, the ministers should

serve the king by holding over his head the royal umbrella, waving the fly whisks, etc. Music and Vedic chanting should go on all the time. An acclamation should follow the ***abhiṣeka***. The king should look at his own reflection in a mirror and in a vessel of melted butter. The chief priest should present ***madhuparka***, the highest complimentary offering, to the anointed king. He should walk round the sacred fire thrice, bow and arrows in hand. An amnesty should be proclaimed to convicted offenders, poor feeding should take place on a lavish scale, the ***Śrīsūkta*** from the ***Viṣnupurāṇa*** be recited, and a leveè of the chief dignitaries and citizens be held. Before mounting the elephant and going round the city, he should mount for a moment the state charger. In the procession through the city, gods in temples on the route should be worshipped, and largesses be scattered all the way. On the day of the coronation, the king should again sleep on the bare ground and observe continence.

  The Purāṇas recommend the repetition of the ***abhiṣeka***on every anniversary of the coronation.

  The detailed account contained in the biography of Śivāji by Malhar Rāmrāo Chitnis (paras 259-274), which has been printed at Poona, shows that the ***full*** ritual was followed scrupulously at his coronation. GāgāBhaṭwas the ***ṛtvik***. The eight ***pradhāns***, among whom there were representatives of the four castes, did the sprinkling. ***Ārti*** was offered by married women. By the completion of the ceremonial after the full number of Śivāji became a ***mūrdhābiṣikta kṣatriya***, and began to date his further regal acts from the date of the coronation.

  The simplified ritual given by Lakṣmīdhara was likely to have been thus added to by the experts who officiated at such ceremonies from time to time. He omits completely the Vedic ritual given in the different Brāhmaṇas, obviously because Purāṇic sanction is sufficient in Dharmaśāstra and some of the Vedic ritual was more relevant to the ***Rājasūya*** sacrifice than to an ordinary coronation.



THE VEDIC CORONATION

  Mitramiśra gives the Vedic (***Śrauta***) ritual from the ***Aitareya Brāhmaṇa*** with explanatory comments, after exhausting

the Purāṇic descriptions, which also prescribe the use of certain specified Vedic ***mantras*** during the ceremony. That the significance of the ancient rite was then forgotten is evident from the incorrect explanations given by him as well as other commentators. The latter explain the term ***rājā-kartāraḥ*** (king-makers), the ***rātnins*** (twelve in number, including the ***rājanya***), who officiated at the Vedic coronation and took part in the ***abhiṣecana***, as ministers' (***mantriṇaḥ***), while Mitramista (p. 97) interprets it as "agnatic relations" ([***pitṛvya-bhrātrādayaḥ***](# "See the comments on the term in Ayodhyākāṇḍa, 79, 1.")) ! They naturally miss also the constitutional import of the institution, though in the ***Rāmāyāṇa*** it is signified by their assembling, along with the leading Brāhmaṇas, sages, and ministers, to consider the interregnum which had occurred on the death of [Daśaratha](http://॑# "व्यतीतायां तु शर्वर्यामादित्यस्योदये ततः ।समेत्य राज्यकर्तारः सभामीयु र्द्विजातयः ॥ (अयो. का. ७०, २)."). The participation of representatives of the four ***varṇas*** and the ministers in the epic ritual is a survival, whose origin and nature must have been also forgotten in later times. In the ***abhiṣecana***described in ***Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa***, the king steps on a tiger skin spread in front of the sacred fire, and he is then sprinkled by a Brāhmaṇa, a Kṣatriya, and a Vaiṣya as well as by a ***Janya*** (a member of a hostile tribe), whose place is later on taken by the Śūdra (***Sat. Br.***, V, 3, 5, 11-14). The king who has meanwhile been given his mantle, diadem and underwear, is then announced to 'all men' (***āvit mārtyāḥ***) as well as to certain immortal gods ***viz***. Agni, Indra, Mitrā-Varuṇa, Pūṣan, Viśvedevāḥ, Heaven and Earth (***Dyāvāpṛthvī***) and [Aditi](# "वाजसनेयसंहितायाम् (१० - ९) यथा - आवि॑र्मर्य्या आवि॑त्तो अग्निगृहप॑तिरा॑वि॑त्तइ्न्द्रो वृद्ध॑श्रवा आवि॑त्तौ मि॒त्रावरु॑णौ घृ॒तव्रतावि॑त्तः । पूषा विश्ववे॑दाआवि॑त्तो द्यावा॑पृथिवी वि॒श्वश॑म्भुवा वा॒वि॒त्तादि॑तिरुरुशर्मा ॥"). The king next takes a vow, or oath in modern parlance, in the following terms: "Between the night in which I am born and the night I die, may I be deprived of

whatever good I may have done (in the period), of my heaven, of my life and of my progeny, if I wrong (***yadi te druhyeyam***) [you](# "ऐतरेयब्राह्मणे (८, ४, १५) यथा –– [एतेनैन्द्रेण महाभिषेकेण क्षत्रियं शापयित्वा अभिषिञ्चेत् । स ब्रूयात् सह श्रद्धया] ")."The taking of the oath makes the king ***dhṛta-vrata***. This is done before he takes his seat on the throne, after investiture.

**THE PLEDGE OF PṚTHU**

  Pṛthu, the miraculously created son of the oppressor Vena, is asked by the sages to take a similar oath (***pratijñāmśca adḥirohasva***), in a legend recounted in the ***Mahābhārata*** (Śānti., Iviii, 115-117) : 'I will protect the earth. I will carry out without hesitation (***aśankaḥ***) the Dharma contained in ***Daṇḍanīti***. I will not be capricious (***svavaśaḥ***).' He replied "Let it be so." Dr. K. P. Jayaswal terms this a coronation oath of the epic age. It is more of the nature of a contract, like the one entered by Manu and the people when kingship was first created. The ***S'atapatha Brāhmaṇa*** (V, 3, 5, 4) states that Pṛthu the son of Vena was the first appointed king of the earth. The epic legend is related to the ***Brāhmaṇa*** legend. The implication of the story is that the pledge to secure good government is as old as the state.

PURĀṆIC RITUAL

  The Purāṇic descriptions give only the outline of the ceremonial to be observed and the ***mantras***, which can not be missed on the occasion. Doubtless the ritual of the ***Brāhmaṇas*** was imported in historical times into the ceremonies conducted by expert priests. The tendency was to add, not to reduce, the elements. This is shown by the elaborate way in which the ***Viṣnodharmottara*** prescribes that the benedictions of a multitude of miscellaneous divinities, sages, and objects credited with life and power, as well as heroes join in "sprinkling" the king (***ete tvām abhiṣiñcantu***). The seven worlds are invoked to give the anointed king victory (p. 76). The seven ***dvīpas*** are to

reflect his sovereignty. All sacred literature and all learning are to show him the way to victory (***vijayam pratidiśantu***). All sacred waters then known are invited by name to bathe him (***abhiṣiṅcantu***).



HAS IT A CONSTITUTIONAL SIGNIFICANCE ?

  It has sometimes been suggested that the Vedic ritual was deliberately omitted in medieval ***nibandhas*** from a wish to leave monarchy absolute and unfettered by any restrictions. This is not correct. All ***nibandhas*** place the king under, not above, Dharma. His obligation to abide by Dharma is emphasized over and over again. The moment the king becomes ***abhiṣikta***, he comes automatically under a vow (***dhṛta-vrata***) to safeguard Dharma. His freedom ends with coronation. A vow taken at his installation cannot be a more potent restraint on wayward conduct than the ***daily*** reminder of his subordination to the laws of divine justice.



CORONATION OF A SUCCESSOR

  Caṇḍeśvara is the only ***nibandha-kāra***, who has dealt with the question of the installation of a successor, in the life-time of the previous ruler, with his concurrence and sanction. The case must have been of occasional occurrence, and would normally be possible only when the abdicating ruler was assured of the good feeling and loyalty of the [successor](# "Rājanītıratnakara, pp. 66-69.").In early ages, glorified in literature, when a king laid down his sovereignty and retired to the forest as a ***vānaprastha***, as the heroes of the ***Raghuvamśa*** are said to have [done](http://॑# "वार्द्धके मुनिवृत्तीनां (१, ८)"),such a case must have ordinarily arisen. The usual coronation rites would be supposed applicable in such an event. Caṇḍeśvara's extract describing the procedure on the occasion of the transfer of sovereignty is stated in one manuscript to be from ***Rājadāna-taraṅga*** (***Rājyadāna*** ?). The ritual is briefer than the Purāṇic and has some points of difference. It is as follows. After finishing his daily rites, the king, or his chief priest, enters the hall of sacrifice (***yajñasālā***) where the

ceremony is to take place, clad in white. He places there a golden pol, in front of the firepit, fills it with Ganges water or other holy water, covers the mouth, invokes Varuṇa into the pot and worships him, using a bunch of five leaves for sprinkling. After the worship, medicinal plants are thrown into the pot. The following divinities are then be invoked and worshipped : Śrī, Viṣṇu, Umā, Śiva (Isāna) and the lords of Gaṇas (Gaṇapati), the planets (Gṛhapati, ***i.e***. Sūrya) and of the quarters (the Lokapālas), with fire offerings, through ***ājya***, with appropriate ***mantras***. After the invocation is revoked (***visṛjya***), the king sprinkles (***abhiṣiñcet***) the heir-apparent with water taken in the tuft of leaves aforesaid, in the presence of allies, Brahmans, merchants, ministers and relations, the appropriate mantras of propitiation (***śāntimantra***) being recited simultaneously. The prince stands on a tiger skin, when being sprinkled. The king then seats the prince on the throne, garlands him, smears him with sandal, decorates him with the royal fillet (***paṭa***) and headdress (***uṣṇīṣa***) and jewels set with pearls and precious stones, and presents to him the royal umbrella, fly-whisks, and sandals. Thus dressed up, the kingdom with the remaining six elements (***ṣaḍaṅga***) is made over to the new ruler. The old king makes the ***tilaka*** on the forehead (of the new ruler thrice, of the size of the great toe. Dūrva grass and rice are spinkled on his head, and he is made to see curds and fried grain (***lāja***). The retiring king then proclaims again and again - "From today the kingdom is not mine, this is the king, and may he protect the subjects", and call upon every one, including the subjects (in whom there lies divinity, ***prajā-Viṣṇum***) to witness the change of sovereignty.



THE QUALITIESREQUIRED OF THE KING

  In the glorification of kingship the stress is on the duty of the subjects to the ruler. The relation between the two necessitates a corresponding elaboration of the qualities which a king should possess if he should deserve the office. The ***Mahābhārata***, the Purāṇas and the ***smṛtis*** deal comprehensively with the requisite ***rājaguṇāḥ***. A collection of these is made by Lakṣmīdhara in chapter III. The enunciation of these qualifications is necessary, because of the exaltation of the monarch's person and

office. It should be made clear that a king is no king, when he does not come up to the required standard. Bṛhaspati (***infra***. p. 82) has pointed out that lordship and his office do not desert the innocent king. When defects in a king's son have a limited scope for ***public*** harm, the vices or weaknesses of a king will prove a major disaster. A section of the book is devoted accordingly to the actions of the consccrated king (***abhiṣikta-kṛtyāni***). One wanting in ability could not fill the position properly. "A king lacking ability will surely be unable to protect his subjects. A kingdom is a heavy burden, difficult to [bear](http://॑# "शान्तिपर्वणि (९१, ४८) यथा - न जात्वदक्षो नृपतिः प्रजाः शक्नोति रक्षितुम् । भारो हि सुमहान्तात राज्यं नाम सुदुर्ब्रहम् ॥").A description of the vices or temptations to which kings are likely to succumb is as much called for as the specification of the good qualities which ensure a successful reign.

  The royal weaknesses or temptations are collectively termed ***vyasana***. Ten of them are born of "passion" and eight of anger, says Manu (***inf***. p. 143). Hunting, gambling, sleeping by day, scandalous talk, drink, excessive indulgence in music, acting and dancing, music and drink, and aimless tours are vices of the first type. Meanness, rashness, treachory, envy, slander of rivals, wastefulness, violent temper, and excessive severity are of the second class. They have all to be conquered by careful self-discipline. In wastefulness must be included neglect of forts and buildings, and lavish gifts out of season and to undeserving persons. The enemies of man are said to be six (***ṣaḍ-varga***) ***viz***. sexual indulgence, temper, intoxication, pride, covetousness and self-satisfaction. An undisciplined nature and want of humanity leads to disaster. It undermines a king's prosperity as age destroys beauty (p. 148). Six ancient instances of rulers destroyed by arrogance are given (p. 157) from Manu, and four of those who were raised by modesty. The correctives to the tendencies to vice are careful education and training as a prince, proper choice of associates from youth upwards, good advisers, a life full of beneficent activity and methodical habits. Natural gifts should be strengthened by training and study.

  On the positive side, the enumeration of virtues is fairly exhaustive. About forty-five are enumerated by Śaṅka-Likhita

(p. 18). A broad outlook (***sthūlalakṣya***), gratitude, reverence for the aged, personal purity, a charitable-disposition, courage and mastery of the relevant sciences are emphasized by ***Yājñavalkya*** (p. 19). Self-reliance, eloquence and conversational gifts are indicated by ***Kātyāyana*** (p. 20). Viṣṇu looks for success only in the close identification of the ruler with the happiness and sorrows of his people. A compassionate disposition, sympathy with the poor and afflicted, kindness to servants, relentlessness towards foes, and straight dealing are also emphasised (p. 21). All concur in calling for consideration to Brāhmaṇas. Gautama roundly declares that the king "rules" every one except the Brāhmaṇa, and the declaration is interpreted as implying that when they err they should receive more consideration than others who transgress. It is not a claim for ***imperium in imperio*** on behalf of a class, like that claimed in Europe by the Church in the Middle Ages. India knows no such thing as the "benefit of the clergy."

  The ***smṛtis*** lay strees on certain virtues and weaknesses more than others, leading to the implication that they were likely to be more needed (as virtues) and more common (as vices) than others. One of these qualities is prompt despatch of business, and condemnation of laziness or postponement of business. The ***dīrgha-sūtra***, the procrastinator, is condemned by all authorities. An autocrat, with ministers, has every inducement to leave the disposal of business to them and to let things slide. Dilatory methods in administration afflict the people. Delayed justice is injustice. This is why Aśoka lays claim to his own prompt disposal of business, to his availability at all places and times for the transaction of state business, and to his determination to see that there is no delay in the disposal of business by his own [servants](# "The whole of the Sixth Rock Edict is devoted to the subject of prompt despatch. See D. R. Bhandarkar, Asoka, 1932, pp. 315-316.").But promptness is not the same as impulsive and hasty action. To act in haste, anger, pride, over-confidence (***māna***) and rage and in an impious mood is not the promptitude required in administration (p. 153).

  Self-control is dictated to kings as much by prudence as by ethical considerations. A king who is master of wealth but not of his passions or temper courts ruin.(p. 150). One brake on

hasty action is the practice of consultation of ministers. Yama is quoted in [***Vīramitrodaya***](# "Nītiprakas'a, p, 134.")******for the view that the king who never acts alone in business (***naikaḥ kāryāṇai yaḥ kuryāt***) sueceeds in permanently gaining the earth ([***atyantam yāti medinīm***](# "See Manu, VII, 55, quoted infra, p. 23 and the Mahabharata, on p. 149.")),Constant association with virtuous and learned men is held up to the king as of lasting benefit to himself and to the kingdom. On the other hand an atheist or blasphemer must be kept [out](# "Cf. Mann, IV 123 - नास्तिक्यं वेदनिन्दां च देवतानां च कुत्सनम् । द्वेषं दम्भं च मानं च क्रोधं तैक्ष्ण्यं च वर्जयेत् ।and II, 10,11 - श्रुतिस्तु वेदो विज्ञेयो धर्मशास्त्रं तु वै द्विजः ।ते सर्वार्थेषु मीमांस्ये ताभ्यां धर्मो हि निर्वभौ । योऽवमन्येत ते मूले हेतुशास्रायाद्विजः। स साधुभिर्बहिष्कार्यो नास्तिको वेदनिन्दकः । See P. V. Kane, History of Dharmasastra, II, (1941), pp. 359-360 for further references."),and the cultivation of philosophy (***ānvīkṣikī*** or ***ātmavidyā***) must be in branches which are not opposed to the scriptures (***vedāviruddha***). Both the motive to right conduct and restraint of wrong-doing must be based on a conception of morality, which finds its meaning in the faith that goodness is grounded in God, that He alone is perfection, as well as the ground and goal of goodness, and that all action must aim at an approximation to Him. This is the Dhārmic view. It is particularly applicable for restraining autocratic authority. The ***cārvāka*** or ***nāstikā*** or ***pāṣaṇḍa*** recognizes no standard but his own, and a king who falls under their influence will degenerato into the slave of his own impulses and sensual cravings, to the ruin of himself and his kingdom. The atheist's crime is his undermining the foundations of moral conduct. This is why writers on Arthaśastra also condemn his [association](# "See Śukranīti, IV, i, 194-222.").



**THE DUTIES OF THE CROWNED KING (ABIIIṢIKTA-KṚTYA)**

  The treatment of the duties is usually prefaced by discussions of the proper place of self-reliance and dependence upon divine action, or to put it in a different way, between free will and predestination. The quality which makes a ruler function properly is termed ***Pauruṣam*** (manliness). The

consideration of the topic is brought by Mitramiśra under counsel (***mantra***), while Lakṣmīdhara brings it under expedition (***yātrā***), one of the six traditional expedients of policy. His sovereign was in a real sense a ***vijigīṣu***, 'would-be-conqueror,'imbued with a desire to extend his dominions. A fatalistic disposition in such a person will spell ruin. Certain verses attributed to Manu, but not found in the extant ***Manusmṛti*** (p. 140), are quoted to advocate a combination of reliance on one's own effort as well as on divine support, and to condemn a spirit of fatalistic quietism. Fatalism is the creed of the coward and the sluggard, says the ***Rāmāyaṇa*** (p. 140). For success a conjunction of divine support, personal initiative and a suitable moment are all three needed (p. 141). What is termed Daiva (divine support) is really one's own making (***ātmakṛtam vidyāt***), says ***Vyāsa*** (p. 141) ; for, it is only the fruit of individual effort in a past birth, which is remembered and acts in the next. Man is the master of his fate.

  The negative aspect of royal conduct, ***i.e***., what the king has to avoid, has been already indicated. On the positive side, some desultory advice is given. The king should be humble, and continue to learn the art of government. Even from the prattle of a child he may learn wisdom (p. 149). The king who will not heed the advice tendered by his real friends is his foe's best ally (p. 150). His efforts should be directed to keep up his strength for offence and defence (Gautama). He must be secret and yet master the secrets of his foe. In attack he must be a lion, in swiftness of movement a hare, in tenacious hold a wolf, and in prolonged reflection a heron.



THE KING'S DAILY TIME-TABLE

  There is agreement among both the writers on Dharmaśāstra and Arthaśāstra in arranging the daily routine of the king, so that certain periods of the day are set apart for certain duties. Methodical attention is the only means of preventing accumulation of work or the cultivation of the condemned habit of dilatoriness. The day and the night are each divided into eight parts, of an hour and a half each, and each such part has its appointed work. The king awakes to the sound of music, and according

to the ***kāvyas***, to the chaunts of heralds and bards ([***vandimāghadhāḥ***](# "e.g. Raghuvamśa, V, 66-75, beginning with 'रात्रिर्गता मतिमतां वर मुञ्च शय्यां’")).He retires to rest also at night to the sound of trumpets, which apparently declare that after that hour no one can see the king on business (***samviśet hāya-ghoṣena, pratibuddhyet tathaiva ca***). He should attend to his accounts the first thing in the morning, an injunction which emphasizes the vital consequence of finance to the kingdom. IIe should devote the next period to the personal conduct of trials and causes. After his judicial duties are over, he must be available to his ministers and to persons who wish to see him on public affairs. Then follow the bath and mid-day meal. After some rest and amusement in the inner apartments, he should return to work. There must be a daily review of the forces, inspection of stores and treasure, consultations with ministers (meetings of the "privy council" so to speak), and audience to the ***Senānī***, conference with the secret agents, who will make confidential reports in person, immediately after his evening devotions. Then supper and rest. In intervals, he should study and employ himself in listening to the sage counsel of the aged and the wise. The drift of the arrangement is to leave no part of the day unemployed. A king should have no idle hour or holiday. Manu considerately allows him to delegate duties to the chief minister, in case of indisposition (p. 163). The three-fold duty of the king (according to ***Nārada***) ***viz***., protection, adjudication and service to the aged and wise, will thus be daily discharged (p.154). The importance of the king's personal safety leads to the injunction to propitiate the unseen powers constantly, and to take precautions against assassination and poisoning. In audience he should always be well guarded, (***kṛta-rakṣaḥ***).

  Elaborate advice is tendered to the king on the precautions to be taken against poisoning. It recalls the detailed prescriptions of the [Arthaṣāstra](# "I, 20-21 Medhātithi (VII, 152) refers to three out of the seven cases of assassination in the Seraglio recounted by Kanṭilya."), but consistently with his practice to rely only on Dharma sources, Lakṣmīdhara extracts the relevant matter from a ***purāṇa***, and from Manu (pp. 158-161). Manu gives the general advice that the personal servants of the king, male and

female, should be chosen for their loyalty, incorruptibility, vigilance, and knowledge of spells and antidotes against poison. They should have been well examined before appointment. The women who attend on the king should be first examined, with the object, obviously, of seeing that their clothing or ornaments contain no poisons or weapons. The king's carriage, bed, seat, bath and toilet as well as the ornaments he wears should be examined first before he uses them. The king is advised to wear jewels containing gems which detect or cure poison (an old and widespread belief, which we find all the world over). The Chief Butler ([***Sūpādhyakṣa***](http://॑# "गरुडपुराणे – पितृपैतामहो दक्षः शास्त्रज्ञः सत्यवाचकः ।शौचयुक्तः सदाचारः सूपकारः स उच्यते ॥ 'शास्त्रज्ञः 'नल-भीम-सुषेणादिकृतसूपशास्त्रज्ञः । 'आर्द्रकं गुडसंयुक्त' 'ताम्रपात्रे स्थितं गव्यं' इत्यादि निषिद्धज्ञानाय धर्मशास्त्रज्ञश्च (वी. मि., पृ. १८२)."))and the Betel-bearer ([***Tambūladhāri***](# "मात्स्ये अनाहार्योऽनृशंसश्चदृढभक्तिश्च पार्थिवे । ताम्बूलधारी भवति नारी वाप्यथ तद्गुणा ॥ इति वी. मि., पु. १८१.")) are made important court functionaries in the purāṇic extracts cited by later writers, with the special qualifications needed for their duties.



SACERDOTALISM : THE PUROHITA

  It was an age of intense faith in the efficacy of sacrifices and rites for the placation of divinities. Lakṣmīdhara shares the belief. As all such rites have to be conducted under the direction or by the royal ***Purohita***, this functionary has to be chosen with great care. He should be more than a priest. Expert knowledge of Astrology and Arthaśāstra will be expected of him. On the same ground, liberality to ***śrotriyas*** is enjoined. The gods find delight in hearing the chanting of the Vedas, says Katyāyāna the jurist (p. 168). Donations to them constitute an inexhaustible treasure (***akṣaya-nidhiḥ***). Errors in administration. are corrected or expiated by the prayers of ***Brāhmaṇas*** (p.173). There is thus identity of interest between king and Brāhmaṇa, who should accordingly be generously patronized (pp. 171-176). Regal duty does not stop with sectional patronage. It includes development of trade and crafts (p. 171), the relief of destitution, and liberal medical relief, for which hospitals should be founded.

The humanc advice reflects the practice of good kings like Aśoka, who believed in their spiritual [cflicaciousness](# "See his Second Rock Edict, Bhandarkar, op. cit., pp. 299-300.").

  The indication of the need to maintain the first ***varṇā*** is supported by specific advice on the necessity to perform, with its help, certain ceremonies in order that calamities threatening the kingdom may be averted and the favour of super-natural agencies may be secured. Besides the daily worship of the household divinities every evening, bali offerings must be made to goblins ([***piśācebhyaḥ***](# "infra, p. 176.")).Every year, two ***lakṣa-homas*** must be performed, and in a reign, atleast one ***koṭi-homam*** for the removal of fear (***abhaya-prada***). With the help of his ministers and priest, the king should perform the ordinary, special and purposive (***kāmyāni***) rites. Expiatory ceremonies should be done at eclipses, and a ***mahā-sānti***, when there has been an earthquake (p. 166). A king should specially worship two divinitics, ***viz***. Kārtikeya (to overcome enemies) and Devī, in her many manifestations, separately and as residing in the royal sword, dagger, crown and sandals, and emblazon her figure on the royal standard. They will give him victory in battle. (p. 177).

  Such advice reflects Lakṣmīdhara's own convictions born of his study of the Vedic (especially Ātharvaṇa) rites, and the Purāṇas, which developed magic. The belief has always been there, and it tended to grow in times of special anxiety. We find it in the advice of the usually cool-headed and rational [Kauṭilya](# "कौटिलीये यथा ( पृ. ३६०) – "). Tāntric practices had grown fast in the days following the disruption of the Gupta empire and found their place in the ***tāmasic*** Purāṇas. The times were shrouded in [anxiety](# "This is reflected in the belief in portents and treatises like Ballāla Sona's Adbhuta-sāgara, composed in the generation following Lakṣmīdhara's."). The Gāhaḍwāla kingdom had sprung in the scething troubles of the age, and it was faced by a greater peril than any yet encountered, in the assaults of the Muslim invaders, whom Govindacandra had defeated, but who were destined

ultimately to destroy his empire. A kingdom's safety lay no longer in just rule or in the administration of ***varṇāśramadharma***, as in the heroic past. The harassed mind of the statesmen caught at means of forcing superhuman support, other than these. The reiteration of the old adjurations to maintain sacerdotal privileges, which Buddhism had attacked, the recommendation to enlist for monarchy the support of the first ***varṇa***, in a work on Rājadharma, in a manner which offends ***our*** sense of proportion, and the specification of magical rites, of the worship of special divinities, and of the regular performance of the festivals and rites described in the last six chapters of his work,- when taken side by side with his vigorous commendation of self-reliance, energy and initiative, his severe censure of fatalistic quietism as the cult of the coward and sluggaid, and his repetition of the old injunctions for just rule,- can only be interpreted as reflecting the anxieties of the age and their repercussions on the mind of a scholar-statesman. The numerous inscriptions of the period (and particularly of Govindacandra and his family) show how such advice fell on willing cars and was gladly acted upon. The same advice, repeated in the hey-day of Mughal supremacy, by later writers on ***Rājanīti***, is a patent anachronism.



**THE SAPTĀṄGA**

  The traditional enumeration of the elements of a state is to be found in smrtis like those of Manu (IX, 294) and ***Yājñavalkya*** (I, 354), as well as in works on ***Nītiśāstra*** (e.g. ***Kāmandakīya***, IV, 1) with slight variations in names and order of enumeration. The lists of ***Yājñavalkya*** and ***Kāmandaka*** are identical. The seven are the king (***svāmī***), the ministers, the capital (usually fortified and therefore called ***pura*** or ***durga***), the organized population (***jana*** or ***rāsṭra***), treasure (***kośa***), the armed forces (***bala*** or ***daṇḍa***), and allies (***suhṛt*** or ***mitra***). Manu places them in this order and states that each preceding one is more important than those following. Kāmandaka remarks that they are all mutually helpful, ***i.e***. that each affects all others (***parasparopakāra***). In modern terminology it only means that the complete kingdom should have an organized population, a ruler,

a capital, resources in men, money and material, allies who will help in times of stress and ministers. The insistence on wealth, as an essential element, will recall the remark of Henry IV of France - 'poor peasants, poor country, poor country poor king.'

  Placing the king at the head of the elements is in consonance with the hypothesis of Indian polity that he stands between the people and anarchy (***a-rājatā***). The insistence on ministers, in an organization in which the king is personally responsible for the administration, is a special feature of Indian polity. The minsters may be mere advisers, but they derive their sanction from the same source as kingship itself. It would be therefore contrary to Dharma as well as to expediency, for an Indian king to rule all by himself, dismissing his ministers. The force of any advice tendered to a ruler will depend largely on the qualifications and consitutional position of the adviser. This is the reason for the great detail into which the ***nibandhas***, following the smrtis go into on the qualities of the ministers and royal servants. Manu's capital becomes the fortress (***durga***) of the Gupta epoch writers. It is tempting to read into this change the experience of the country when invading hosts of Śākas and Huns found it easy to over-run a vast campaign, like the Gangetic basin, when it had few or no fortified cities, within which the population can with. draw and stand a successful sicge. The precedence given to ***rāṣṭra*** (***i.e***., the organized people) over the fortress-capital may reflect a war experience that showed (as in our own days) that cities may be taken by an enemy, but an organized nation will survive the fall of its capital. Material resources (***kośa***) take precedence of the army (***bala***), as our own experience shows. War equipment, even in a primitive economy, means ample supplies. A suitable alliance may avert war, or distribute its burden, when it cannot be prevented. The apparently crude list will thus be seen to contain much empirical knowledge.

  The list contains other implications also, when furnished by a Dharmaśāstra. Universal peace and disarmament, based on non-violence, are not reflected by it. On the other hand, the conditions postulated are those of potential war at ***all*** times, The king is usually termed, unless he is a man of no spirit, ***vijigīṣu***, a would-be conqueror. It represents an epoch of unstable frontiers. A kingdom must always to be prepared for an attack

on any of its frontiers, unless it has become a great empire. The kaleidoscopic changes of mediaeval India are due to the spirit. The ambition to extend the area of tributaries was nourished by the war spirit that was induced in the standing militia of Kṣatriyas. It made for internecine struggles, which weakened those who habitually took part in them, and it made them unfit to stand the assault of an enemy far more powerful than the neighbour across the frontier. In such conditions, the desire for a balance of power is automatically imposed on kingdoms, and the ***rajamaṇḍala*** consisting of enemies and allies of diminishing degrees, actual and potential, is evolved in fact and embodied theory. This is illustrated in mediaeval India by the struggles of the powers that happened to have become supreme in the Karṇāṭaka, the Dakhan and Hindusthan. A common enemy unites in alliance his neighbours on opposite [frontiers](http://॑# "Note the alliance between Govindacandra and Kulottunga Cola, united by fear of the ruler of the intervening Dakhan, Vikrāmādītya, VI (Cālukya), and the Pāṇdya and Simhalese revolts against the Cola emperor fomented by Vikrāmādītya. See Introduction to Dānakaṇḍa, p. 14 and p. 36.").The ***saptāṅga*** concept has very much more history and experience behind it than a superficial survey might disclose.



THE OFFICIAL HIERARCHY (AMĀTYĀII)

  The initial quotation from Yājñavalkya (I, 312) lays down two injunctions to the king : he should appoint good ministers (***san-mantriṇaḥ***) and he should hold consultations with them on matters relating to the [kingdom](# "Lakṣmīdhara, as noted by Mitramiśra (p. 177), adopts the reading समन्त्रिणःin Yājñavalkya, I, 312, while Vijñāneśvara reads स मन्त्रिणः"). The consultation should be followed up by a discussion of the advice (received from the minsters individually) with the chief Brāhmaṇa ***i.e.*** the ***Purohita***, before the king takes a decision. Manu indicates the number of minsters to be appointed as seven or eight. There is a difference in the consultations, as envisaged by the two sages. Yājñavalkya makes it collective (***taiḥ sārdham***), while Manu would make it individual consultation (***teṣām svam abhiprāyam upalabhya pṛthak pṛthak***). Every matter should be so taken up (***sarvakāryāṇ***). There is no cabinet of ministers, with a collective responsibility. The relation is more like that of the American

ministers to the President. The ***Purohita*** is expected to he able from equal or superior knowledge, such as a mere priest will not ordinarily possess to review the expert advice tendered. The "chief Brahman" is the lineal successor of the Vedic ***Puroḍhā***, whose identity with his king was represented in picturesque figures. When Śiväji created the famous ***Aṣṭapradān*** council, the Peshwah was styled ***Paṇḍit Pradhān***, being the chief adviser. A premiership is not however implied in the ***Puroḍhā***as, unlike the other ***mantriṇs***, he is not the head of a department of the administration, there being a special ***Dharmādhikārin*** for ecclesiastical affairs.

  The qualifications specified are designed to ensure both loyalty and efficiency. The ministers are all to be of good lineage (***kulīnāḥ***). They should be hereditary subjects of the kingdom (***maula***) and so have a stake in the country, and remain there to experience the results of their own advice and actions. The ministers are pledged to speak out what they honestly think and feel, and are immune from the king's displeasure if they do so. Once they have discharged the duty, and the king has come to a different decision, they must carry it out loyally. Kātyāyana pointedly observes that the kingdom is ruined in which ministers, assessors and physicians merely try to please the king by giving advice which is palatable, instead of speaking out (p. 24). The minister should speak what is good for the ruler, not what is agreeable to him. "Easily found are men who always speak what is agreeable ; far harder is it to find one who will utter unpalatable truth and the ruler who will hear it patiently" (***Rāmāyaṇa***, ***inf***. p. 103).

  The qualifications for the several offices are laid down with insight into their requirements. The Chamberlain (***Pratīhārī***), for instance, who played the part of a modern aide-de-camp, is to have a fine presence, tact, charm and suavity (p. 25). The ***Sandhivigrahika*** should be an adept in the six-fold policy, a judge of opportunity and a diplomat. The description is interesting in view of the office having been held by Lakṣmīdhara himself (p. 26). The officers are to be watched by reliable secret-service agents (***cāra***). The ***Dharmādhakārī*** should be chosen for being a leading Brāhmana, well versed in Dharmaśāstra, and absolutely impartial. The attendants in the seraglio

should not be under fifty years of age, if women, and under seventy, if men.

  An officer of high rank was the ***Dūta***, usually taken as equivalent to a modern ambassador [extra-ordinary](# "No permanent embassies are contemplated in Indian polity.").Great importance was attached to his service, which might secure war or peace. IIis knowledge and ability should be correspondingly high. He was expected to collect information from other courts for his own king. Selection for the duty implied great confidence in his talent, integrity and judgment. Śri Kṛṣṇa acted as ***Dūta*** for his Pāṇḍava cousins and Hanūmān as dita for Śri Rāma. By recognised inter-statal usage a ***Dūta*** could not be slain but, if caught in unfriendly acts, he might be chastised, or disfigured (p. 34).

  The offices specified are obviously illustrative, not exhaustive. It is not right to presume that all the offices mentioned were in existence in every state of ancient India. An attempt would of course be made to Sanskritize the names of functionaries peculiar to a state, as was done in the Marātha kingdom founded by Śivaji. Some idea of the actual offices in the kingdom of Kanauj in Lakṣmīdhara's time may be derived from the extant inscriptions. The chief queen (***paṭṭa-mahiṣī***) and the ***yuvarāja*** exercised almost regal powers in the time of Govindacandra's predecessor, and their consent to grants is recorded therein. As in the Purāṇa extracts, officers of state and officers of the royal household are mixed up in the inscriptions, as in mediaeval Europe. The following officers are named in inscriptions of the dynasty : ***Mantrin*** (Chief Minister) ; ***Purohita***; ***Pratīhāra***, or Chamberlain ; ***Senādhipati*** (Commander-in-chief) ; ***Bhāṇḍagārika*** (Storekeeper) ; ***Akṣapaṭalika*** (Record-keeper, the Nāna Fadnavis of the Marātha times) ; ***Bhișak*** (the Prāṇācārya of the Purāṇa), the chief physican ; ***Naimittika*** or Astrologer (the old ***Śamvatsarika*** of the coronation) ; ***Antaḥpurika*** (Seraglio Superintendent) ; ***Dūta*** or envoy ; ***Kāyastha*** (scribe) ; ***Akarādhikārā***, Superintendent of mines ; and ***Paṭṭaṇādhikāra-puruṣa*** (Mayor of Town). A ***Dharmādhikaraṇika*** is also mentioned in an inscription. The list shows that the Puranic extract was well chosen for its tallying with actual conditions.

  The copper plate grant of Candradeva and Madanapāla of the Gāhaḍvāla dynasty, dated 1097-98, is addressed to his queen, heir-apparent and officers as under : ***Rajarājṅi***, ***Yuvarāja***, ***Mantri, Purohita, Pratīhāra, Senāpati, Bhāṇḍāgārika, Akṣa-paṭalika, Bhiṣak, Naimittika, Antaḥpurika, Dūta, Kari-Tunga-Paṭṭaṇa-Ākara-Sthāna-Gokula-adhikaripuruṣān, samajñāþayati, bodhayati, ādisati ca***. The order of enumeration seems to follow a warrant of precedence and the forms of communication (***samājñāpayati, bodhayati, adisati, i.e.***, 'commands', 'calls the attention of' and 'orders') to the styles appropriate to the rank of the persons addressed.

  The Gāhaḍvāla grants show that they passed through three officers, whose names are often found, apparently for authentication, in the documents themselves : one of them drafts the grant ***e.g***., Pandit Vidyādāsa, who composed the grants of 1105 A.D., (No. I 11 and 12 in the Lucknow Museum) ; another writes it out (in ink) on the plates, (usually a Karaṇika or Kāyastha) and then, a goldsmith or other artisan engraves the grant, following the writing of the Karaṇika. Some of the Karaṇikas bear the title of Thakkūra. It is evident that a ***Sandhivigrahika***, even of lower rank than the ***Mahā-Sāndhivigrahika***, did not draft such grants. In one case the writer of the grant (not the composer) bears the designation ***Dharmalekhin***. Most of the grants found in Benares are to the hereditary Purohit, ***Jāgūśarman***, who is termed ***Mahā-purohita*** in an inscription of Govindacandra, dated Samvat 1176. In an inscription written 21 years later, this priest is referred to as ***Dikṣita Jāgūśarman***, having perhaps performed in the interval a ***yāga*** (sacrifice). This priest's place is taken from 1151 A.D. by his son Paharājaśarman, who also bears the title of ***Rauṭa***.

  The position of chief minister or adviser, which the ***smṛtis*** would give to the ***Mahāpurohita*** or ***Purodhā*** appears in historical times to have passed on to other ministers. Kālidāsa, the general of Jagadekammalla, was Mahāpradhān (premier). The ***Mantri*** of the Gāhaḍvālas was their premier. Lakṣmīdhara refers to himself as ***Mantrīśvara***, Chief Minister, while the title ***Mahāsāndhivigrahika***, by which he styles himself and his father, is not among the dignitaries to whom the

Gāhaḍvāla order cited aboveis addressed. It may indicate that the two offices were combined in him, as premier. The description of qualifications in the smṛtis and Purāņas would indicate that the Commander-in-chief was expected to be an ednanted person, but the other ministers were not necessarily expected to lead armies in the field.

THE ADMINISTRATION ( RĀṢTRASAMGRAHAṆAM)

  *Samgraha* is interpreted as ' meansof protection.' A properly formed administrative system furnishes the means. Its consideration logically follows that of the central executiveconsisting of the king-in-ministry ( ***rāja-amātya*** ). A chapter ( ch. 7 )is devoted to it by Lakşmîdhara.

  The local administration is interpreted in terms of the classification made by Manu, beginning with the family ( *kula* ) as the unit. A village( ***grāma*** ) is made up of several residentfamilies. The villages am grouped in tens, hundreds and thousands. It is unlikely that such decimal grouping was actual. It is only illustrative. The village community managed its own affairsonly offences which the state had to deal with being disposed of by the headmen of villages and higher groups who were appointed by the state. The smaller groups of 10 to 30 villagers are known from inscriptions to have been under officers, who were usually also at the head of the small forcessettled for internal order in the midst of groups of villages. The group above it was the ***bhukti***, comprising from 100 to 500 villages, under ***biogapatis*** or ***bhogikas***. Several ***bhuktis***made up a ***vişaya*** or district, and several viṣayas a ***rāṣtra*** ( province ), indicating by its title that it was formed from some old chiefship. The ***rāṣtrapati*** would usually exercise authority over an area corresponding to a modern division. His status often gave him the rank of ***maha-maṇḍa-leśvara***. Such a personage would be more than a ***sahasrādhapa*** of Manu, entitled to raimbarse himself for the cost of his administration from the income of several towns, made up from the ***daily*** contributions in kind or service, as distinguished from the land revenue, which was an ***annual*** payment, and other taxes. For military organization, Śankha-Likhita ( p. 82 ) indicate a salary of two gold coins a month for the cavalryman.

For special servics rendered by soldiers, extra payments in the form of gifts, marks of distinction, etc. will be given. Compassionategrants areto me made to the tamilies of soldiers killed on duty ( p. 82 ). This must again be regarded as merely illustrative of the line of action which a king should take. Wages for men and women engaged in state work are to be an a daily basis, and bear a due relation to the status of the workman and the task assigned to him. The king is warned to protect the subjects against the illegal exactions and oppression of his subordinates ( p. 83 ). The accountant ( ***kãyastha*** ) had, then as now, a bad name for bis ingenious devices for making illicit profit.Yājñavalkya ( like Kalhaṇa )singles him out for special mention among habitual oppressors ( p. 83 ). A duty is laid on the king to maintain

Śrotriyas ( learned Brāhmaṇas ) who will be usually poor and engaged in ungainfal occupations, destitute young women and widows, and infirm family man. "The king is the refuge of those who lack protectors, the asylum of those who are homeless, the son of the sonless person, who has none else to maintain him in old age, andthe father of destitate orphans." ( Kātyāyana, p. 84 ). The task of pablic education devolved on the learned Brāhimaṇa, who could exact no feefrom his pupilsfor his teaching and the boardhe gave them. Meeting his expenditure from the fise was equivaleat to grants for education. A sixth of the spiritual merit of the oducational, sacrificial and devotional labour of the Brāhmaṇa was balieved to accrue to the king, on the analogy of the sixth of the increase of the land that goes to the ruler ( p. 85 ). Anchorites, ***sanyāsins***, learned Brāhmaṇas and those among them who maintain the sacred fire ( ***āhitāgnayaḥ*** ) areperaons, who do contribute to the commonweal, because they too yield a sixth of their harvest of merit ( ***puṇya*** ), declares Yama ( p. 85 ). The idea of this invisible contribution is elaborated by Manu. He decLares that the king receives from every one his sixth, be it of wealth or of merit or of sin I

  This in the logical extension of the idea that sinand ***puṇya*** in the kingdom result from the king's neglect or conservation of Dharma. The protection, which the king gives, is not only material, i.e., internal security and security against invasion. It includes protection against seasonal vicissitudes and other

manifestations of the displeasure of the gods. A ruler who takes his taxes, but omits the performance of his religious duties is a thief, declares Menu. The emphatic assertion of a duty that a king of lax belief might neglect reflects the importance which is attached in Dharmaśāstra to the spiritual obligations of the State.

REVENUE AND TREASURE

The Dharmaśāstra is less concerned with the details of a complete scheme of public finance than is Artha

śāstra. The pre-occupation of the former is with what may be rightfully taken and the fiscal obligations which rightfully lie on the king. As the king is expected, along with his officers, to be well trained in Arthasāstra and the economics of agriculture and commerce ( ***vārta and vāṇijya*** ), it is not necessary for a *dharma-nibandha* to go beyond laying down certain general principles, and certain injauctions and inhibitions. Fiscal devices that do not contravene these are legitimate, and may be resorter to.

  A king without treasure isno king. He cannot function. He draws his resources from the wealth of his subjects, the increase of whose riches is therefore to his own advantage. Wealth need not be despised. It is the source of not only all human satisfactions but of the craving for right-action and ultimate release ( p. 87 ). Wealth begets wealth, as elephants are caught through elephants, an injunction which implies the wise and productive uses of wealth by the individual and by the state. A tax scheme which trenches on capital is condemned on this principle. The wise milker leaves enough milk in the cow's udder to sustain the calf, for whose sastenance milk is secreted. The tax should be so collected as not to strain the payer. The king should imitate the leach ( ***vāryake*** ), the calf, and the bee. The simile also suggests collection in instalments, which will not impinge on the productive and saving capacity of the subject. Duties, which fall ( in the first instance ) on the merchant, i.e., indirect taxes, should take into consideration all equities and make all due allowance for cost-price, sale-price, carriage, overhead costs, and depreciation. Taxes should be only on what accrues. Remissions of taxes ou failure, partial or

total, of harvests, must be given. It is just toexpect every one to contributewhat is in his power to the support of the kingdom. Greed should not impel a kirg to cut his own roots as well as those of his subjects. He should ignore nojust sourceof revenue or grasp on any which will destroy the tnx-payer. ( p. 93 ).Even when he is hard up, let not the king lay his hand on what he should not take, nor give up any claim, merely because the treasury is already full. The second maximmay seem to offend the modernfiscal conscience, which abhors hoarding, unless it can be shown that it is needed as a war reserve or as aninsurance. War and famine were ever-present menaces in Indla. The building up of surpluses as a resurve against them is therefore defensible.

  The rates of taxation laid down in*smṛtis*, which must have been based on accumulated experiunce, are specified ( pp. 28-89 ). To exceed the proportions will be a contravention of Dharma. The items, specified are not deemed oxhaustive. Outside specifieditems, it is open to raise revenue, when needed, without violating the fundamental principles. Hence it was the practice, notto after the fixed rates, but to add in impostsmade up of supplementary charges. Their number tended to incrouse with the needs of the state and the ingenuity of the finance minister. Lakṣmidhara's own king levied quite a number of such additional taxes or imposts, as may be gatherad from the inscriptions of the reign  
( videR. S. Tripathi, History of Kanauj, 1937, pp. 346-351 ). One of the new taxes was turuşka-daṇḍa, a war-levy to meet the extra burden of resisting the Muslim.[invader](# "So, V. A. Smith. Early Hisory of India, 4th ed., p. 400. Sten Konow ( Epig. Ind., IX, p. 329 ) suggests that it was a taximposed on Muslimssettled in the kingdom of Kanauj-aHinduequivalent to the Jizya. This is unlikely."),

FISCAL EXEMPTIONS

  Taxation is based in ancient India on certain principles. First, it is *according to faculty*. He who has no resourees need not be asked to pay taxes. The poor, the maimed, and those who from their dependent condition are themselves in need of help are naturally exempt, as are also recluses. Āpastamba is cited ( p. 91 ) in support of the exemption from state dues of learned Brāhmaṇas, women of the four varṇas ( thereby excludingfrom the exemption women of *pratiloma* castes) boys, students who live with their teacher ( and are supported by him ) and those who parform lawful austerities ( *dharmaparāḥ*), thereby excluding from the exemption those who practise so

icery or witchcraft, or rites designed to attain specifie aims or power, Sūdras, who live serving Brāhmaṇas ( literally, 'washing their feet'), the blind, the damb and the very old, persons actually afflicted by disease ( incapaciteting thom for gainful occupation ); and those who, by their order, are prohibited from holding or acquiring wealth e.g. sanyāsins. The cripple, the idiot ( ***jaḍah***) and men over seventy years of age are exempted by Manu from taxation of any sort ( p. 92 ). Vasiştha, ( XIX, 23 ), in a passage which is not cited by Lakşmīdhara, explains the exemption of a learned Brāhmaṇa ( Śrotriya ) by specifying bis exclusion, in spite of the wider rule ( I, 43 ) exempting all Brāhmaṇas, and the commentator Kṛṣṇapaṇḍita, thinks that the king, however distressed should take no contribution from the Vaidika Brāhmaṇa whileunder such circumstances the unlearned Brāhmaņa may betaxed. There must be a surplus left after meeting the cost of maintaining bare life before one can be taxed. Hence, the rule of Vasiṣṭha ( cited on p. 92 ) exempting forest tribes, who make a precarious living by burning the jungle and getting a catch-crop. The second principle is that ***double payment should be avoided***. A contribution may be in cash or in kind. Thirdly, ***every one must contribut***e, to the extent of his ***potential*** capacity. He who is physically competent but poor should contribute hislabour. It applies to artisans, apparently as an option ( p. 92 ). Taxesand contributious levied from subjects are in return of the protection afforded by the king, i.e. the state. The king, who collects them but fails to give duc protection, is a robber in fact, if not in name. One of the six, who should be abandoned, even as a wrecked ship is by its crew, ( ***bhinnām nāvam ivārṇave*** ) is the 'king who fails to protect' ( ***arakṣitāramrājānam*** ), says the ***[Mahābhārata](# "शान्तिपर्व, ५६, ४४–( ed Kumbakonam )—  षडेतान् पुरुषान् जह्यात् भिन्नांनावमिवीर्णवे ।  अप्रवक्तारमाचार्यं अनधीयानमृत्यिजम् ॥  अरक्षितारं राजानं भार्यो चाप्रियवादिनीम् ।  ग्रामकामं च गोपालं वनकामं त नापितम् ॥")***. The

same work ( ***ib***. 61, 31-32) declares that a cruel tyrant, who fails to protect his subjects but robs them, is a Kali in the guise of a king; he should be killed by the united people ([***hanyuḥ prajah sannahya.***](# "अनुशासनपर्व, ६१, ३२, ३३ ( ed. Ray ). -  अरक्षितारं हर्तारं विलोप्तारमनयाकम् ।  तं वै राजकलिं हन्युः प्रजास्सना निर्वृशम् ॥  'अहं वो रक्षिते' त्युक्त्वा यो न रक्षति भूमिपः ।  स संहत्य निहन्तव्यः श्वेव सोन्माद आतुरः ॥")) On the other side no subject can escape making his contribution to the state. Taxability is personal. Potential capacity to earn income is equal to the possession of taxable income, and a sturdy mendicant, who is now a burden on the community, could have been made to work for his quota. It is permissible to see in this rule the means of reducing idle vagrancy, which becomes a menace to society.

BRĀHMAṆA IMMUNITIES

  The question of the freedom of the Brāhmaṇa from taxation raises again the consideration of the bases of varṇa privileges. The immunities are laid down in every smṛti and book dealing with Dharma. The Purāņas go even farther than the smṛtis. Manu emunciates the theory that the state is firmly based on a union of the two first [***varṇas***](# "मनुस्मृति, ९, ३२२,  नाऽब्रह्मक्षत्रमृध्नोति नाऽक्षत्रं ब्रह्म वर्द्धते ।  ब्रह्म क्षत्रं च संपृक्तमिह चाऽमुत्र वर्द्धते ॥")( IX, 322 ). Without the Brahmapa to perform the expiatory and propitiatory rites, on which the king's prosperity depends, the king cannot prosper: nor can the Brāhmaṇa subsist without the king to protect him and his religious rites. The union of the two makes for prosperity in this and happiness in the next world. Yama, in an expressive simile, compares the Brāhmaņa to the root of the tree which isthe king, the subjects to its leaves and the ministers to its branches( inf. 173 ) The king should not appropriate the wealth of the Brāhmana ( ***Brahamsvam*** ). It is more deadly than the most virulent [poison](# " वीरमित्रोदय, 8. १५०-  न विषं विषमित्याहुर्मास्वं विषमुच्यते ।  विषमेकाकिनं हन्ति ब्रह्मस्वं सप्तपुरुषान् ॥"). The resumption of any gift of land made

to a Brāhmaṇa is prohibited, whether the gift was made by a king or by a [predecessor](# "परदतां च भुवं नापहरेत्। (विष्णुस्मृति, ३, ८३).").A Brāhmaṇa's property is not lost by adverse possession or by [limitation](# "आधिः सीमा बालधनं निक्षेपोपनिधिः स्त्रियः । राजस्वं श्रोत्रियस्वं च न भोगेन प्रणश्यति ॥ ( ८, १४९).").(***Manusmṛti***, VIII, 149) All finders of treasure-trove have to surrender to the king, according to their varna, a portion of the find, except the Brahmaṇa who gets the whole, besides shares in all [finds](# " If the King himself found a treasure, he was to yield a half to Brāhmaṇas. See Gautama (X, 43-45), Vasiṣtha (III, 13-14), Viṣṇu (III, 56-64), Yājnavalkya (I 34-35) and Manu (VIII, 37-38).").There is a difference of opinion among commentators like Vijñānesvara and Aparārka on the reconciliation of the apparent conflict between the injunctions of Gautama, Manu, Vasistha, Vişņu and Yājñvalkya on the different proportions of treasuretrove to go to the state and to the finders of different castes. Mitramisra discusses it at length (pp. 266-268). The topic is omitted by Lakṣmidhara. When Mitramisra wrote the question must have passed, with well-established Mughal sovereignty, outside the field of practical politics.

  The position is stated by Vasiṣṭha (I, 42-43): "The king who rules in accordance with Dharma shall take one-sixth of wealth; but, from others than Brāhmaṇas; for he obtains a sixth of the (merit) of ***iṣṭā*** and ***pūrtā*** rites (performed by them); and (because) the Brahmana enriches the Veda (ie, makes the Veda bring prosperity by using it in rites), and rescues (all) from calamities. This is why the Brahmaņa is non-taxable. Soma is his [king](# "राजा तु धर्मेणानुशासत्षष्ठं धनस्य हरेत् । अन्यत्र ब्राह्मणान् । इष्टापूर्तस्य तु षष्ठांशं भजतीतिह ब्राह्मणो वेदमाढयं करोति ब्राह्मणो आपद उद्धरति तस्माद्राह्मणो नाद्यः। सोमोस्य राजा भवतीति ह।")."This declaration seems to place the members of the first varna outside not only the fiscal but the entire jurisdiction of the state. *Mahabhārata* (***Śānti-parva,*** 76, 8), describes Brāhmaṇas, who desert their spiritual offices and austerities and betake themselves to low occupations, and winds up by declaring that they are not ***srotriyas***, because they do not maintain the fire (***an-āhitāgnayaḥ***). Them the

king must compel to pay every kind of [tax](# "अश्रोत्रियाः सर्व एते चाऽनाहिताग्नयः ।  तान्सर्वान् धार्मिको राजा बलि विष्टिं च कारयेत् ॥ ( शान्तिपर्व, ७६, ८ ) ."). It has already been shown that Vasiṣṭha himself restricts total exemption from taxation to ***srotriyas***, and the commentator implies that even a Brāhmaṇa, who is not a sratriya, enjoys the exemption, except in times of difficulty for the king.

   There is history behind the statement that while every one's king is the de facto ruler, Soma (the god) is the king to Brāhmaṇas. This is stated in the *Satapatha* [*Brāhma*ṇa](# "शतपथब्राह्मणे, (५, ४, २, ३):-  तदस्मा ऽ इदँ सवमाद्यं करोति ब्राह्मणमेवापोद्धरति । तस्माद्ब्राह्मणो नाद्यः।सोमराजा हि भवति ॥").While everything is "food" for the king, the king himself is "food" for the Brāhmaṇa. The king wields the danda (rod of punishment) over every one, but the Brāhmaṇa has a counter-rod (***pratidaṇḍa***) the power of the curse or excommunication, which can be used even against the king (***Pañcavimsa Brāhmaṇa***, XVIII, 10, 8). It shows the superiority of the spiritual to the the temporal power. It may be regarded, as is done by Dr. A. K. Coomarasamy, as the mastery of mind over mere force, of the adviser over the executive. Without the Brāhmaṇa's co-operation a yāga is impossible, and both are the supporters the sacrificial rites (***dhṛtavratau***). Dr. Jayaswal holds that the original claim was only for tax-exemption, which was later on expanded into one for independence of a civil [power](# " Hindu Polity, II, p. 32."). Dr. A. K. Coomarasamy [holds](# "Spiritual Authority and Temporal Power in the Indian Theory of Government, New Haven, 1942.") that the claim for superiority is Vedic, that the smrti merely repeats what is in the Veda, and that there was no conscious imposition of the Brahmanical power over the civil in the days of the Dharmasāstras. It is worth noting that no mere assertion of such a claim will receive recognition from king or people except in an age in which both believed in them, no less than those in whose favour they seem to be urged. It is this feeling which is behind the exaltation of both the spiritual power, as exemplified by the Brāhmaṇa, and the 'civil,' as denoted by the king in the Dharmasāstra

literature. It negatives the division of the motives impelling to the formation of the state into temporal and spiritual, and affirms the union of both as necessary for the upkeep of 'society. The chief priest (***Purodhā***) takes precedence of the king, and he who puts him before the king is the king himself. This is shown by the use of the marriage formula-"I am That, thou art This, "I am the Sky, thou art the Earth," etc.- in the colloquy between priest and king in the ***Aitareya Brāhmaṇa*** (VIII, 27). The support of the wielder of spiritual power enables the wielder of force to function rightfully as the head of the community. A king is no king, endowed with the rights and duties of the office, till he has been sprinkled (***abhi- ṣikta***) in the ceremony of coronation, conducted by the Brāhmaṇa. It is reading history backwards to interpret the mutual relations of the ***sacerdotum*** and ***regnum*** as rivalry, and not willing union, and to read the minds of those who accepted the arrangement by our own psychology. In the minds of the persons, who accepted the idea, inherent in ***varṇāśrama-dharma*** generally and in the first ***varṇa*** specifically, the apparent immunity is no immunity, as it is contingent explicitly on the fulfilment of obligations, lying on the first varṇa from birth, by the members of it to whom the exemptions from taxation, or from ordinary scales of punishment or ordinary jurisdiction, are to apply. Honour in lieu of material advantages, volun- tary gifts on a few occasions in lieu of inherited wealth, casual income, liability to a life of austere poverty, hard study and unremunerated teaching, went along with protection from wanton insult (warded off by exceptionally severe penalties), freedom from calls that would stand in the way of the discharge of religious obligations (e.g. exemption from summons to courts as witnesses, ***Visņu***, VIII, 1-2), and a tariff of penalties, which differs from the ordinary in attacking only those possessions, which constitute the Brāhmaṇa's strength and claim to consideration. The first ***varna*** was deemed an asset to the kingdom, if its members discharged their appointed functions or did their Dharma. This is why in colonisation, and the formation of fortified cities or fortresses, which are destined for refuge in times of grave national stress, the king is enjoined to fill them them with ***śrotriyas.*** Their decay leads

to a weakening of the kingdom in every one of its elements. This is the meaning of the warning that the kingdom in which Brāhmaņas perish of starvation itself [perishes,](# "विष्णुधर्मोत्तरे यथा-  यस्य राज्ञस्तु विषये श्रोत्रियः सीदति क्षुधा ।  तस्य सीदति तद्राष्ट्रंदुर्भिक्षव्याधितस्करैः ॥( वी. मि., पृ., १२७ ).")and of the denunciation of the eight forms of baiting or persecution of Brāhmaņas as steps in rapid [ruin](# "महाभारते -  अष्टौ पूर्वनिमित्तानि नरस्य विरमिष्यतः ।  ब्राह्मणाम् प्रथमं द्वेष्टि ब्राह्मणांश्च विरुद्वयते ॥  ब्राह्मणस्वानि चादते ब्राह्मणांश्च जिघांसति ।  रमते निन्दया चैषां प्रशंसां नाभिनन्दति ॥  नेतान्स्मरति कृत्येषु याचितश्चाभ्यसूयति ।  एतान्दोन्नरःप्राज्ञो बुद्धया बुद्ध्वाविसर्जयेत् ॥( वी.मि., पृ. १४४ ).").The same principle underlies the special treatment of Brāhmaṇas in civil and criminal law. There is no intention in the scheme of making things easy and comfortable to one varṇa at the expense of others. The inscriptions of mediaeval India show how thoroughly society was steeped in this belief. Differences of treatment based on service or merit, when duly recognized, do not create a feeling of unfair discriminaton and class rivalry.

THE ALLY ( MITRA )

  The section on the ally, who is included in the traditional enumeration of the seven limbs of the kingdom (inf. p. 97), as the last and the least in importance, is one of the briefest, and is reproduced entire by the ***Viramitrodaya***. In a condition of weak inter-statal law, and of small states, alliances are obviously desirable, particularly for small powers. But, since the aim of every state will be to look first and to own interests, alliances which are not based on natural causes, such as situation, are apt to be weak. The ally of today may be the foe of tomorrow, and the enemy of today may become an ally in the future. Self-interest is the strongest motive (***svārthastu baluvattaraḥ***) and it overcomes likes and dislikes (p. 97). Interests create friendships and enmities in states, and there is no such1

thing as a permanent entente cordiale between states. A power which is now weak may become strong in future, and a growing power should be made an ally and kept an ally by all devices. Even a weak ally, if he is loyal and dependable, is an asset. It is this which makes an alliance more valuable to a state than the acquisition of treasure and territory (Manu, inf., p. 96). The implication is two-fold: securo an ally even by subsidies and by conceding territory; and, conversely, do not lose an ally by cupidity. Natural allies are those who have been so for genera- tions (e.g. Britain and Portugal), or the discontented feudatories or the enemies of the enemy (p. 96), and artificial allies (kṛtrima) are secured by appeals to their avarice. Of these, natural allies are preferable. It is noteworthy that the shrewd Kautilya has no faith in permanent alliances, and regards alliances only as arrangements to get over immediate [difficulties](# " Arthasāstra, (first edn.), pp. 287-290."). He recommends allies to be closely watched. Refusal to accept payment for help in extricating an ally from internal disorder or an invasion, may cement friendship between two states, and secure similar good service in future to the helpful ally. Contrary to the Dharma- s'āstra valuation of the relative uses of alliance, gold, and territory, Kautilya holds the first to be the weakest of the gains, since an ally can always be bought by subsidies or territorial [concessions](# "संहितप्रयाणे मित्रहिरण्यभूमिलाभानामुत्तरोत्तरो लाभः श्रेयान् । मित्रहिरण्ये हि भूमिलाभाद्भवतः मित्र हिरण्यलाभात् यो या लाभः सिद्धः शेषयोरन्यतरं साधयति । (p. 287).").

THE FORTRESS (DURGA)

  In ancient warfare, in the absence of explosives and means of attack from the air, such as we now have, a fortress offered real protection. It could only be carried by escalade, as was Asīrgarh in the Central Provinces, on the road between the Dakhan and Hindusthan, or starved into submission. The success with which the fortified town of Bhartpūr withstood a siege by Lord Lake in 1804 furnishes another illustration of the impregnability of such a defence. It is easy to appreciate the value attached by ancient writers to a large fortress, well

supplied with provisions and means of defence, and well-gar risoned, to a kingdom. The walled city and the walled village were common features of India's past. The purpose of such a fortress, according to Yājñavalkya, to safeguard one's people, treasure and person (***jana-kosatmaguptaye***). Natural advantages may be made the most of by such a fortress. It may be surrounded by a wide stretch of desert, offering no harbourage to the enemy and no means of concealment to a foe (***dhanva-durga***); it may be built on a high plateau (mahi- durga) like Chitorgarh in Rājputana; it may be strongly protected by mud walls [(***mṛd-durga***)](# " Printed editions of Manu, VII, 70, and Mitramis'ra read महोदुर्गमब्दुर्गंfor महीदुगमद्बंर्ग of Lakṣmidhara. Ab-durga is described as a fort surrounded by unfathomable water (Medhātithi)."),like Bharatpūr; it may be protected by impenetrable jungle (vārkşam) as mediaeval Bednür, was in Karnāṭaka ; or it may be placed on the top of a hill (***giridurga***), like Gwalior (Gopādri) and, Devagiri (Daulatabad), or he simply a fortified encampment (***ny-durga***). A town on a ridge, surrounded by concentric walls, one within another, like Chitorgarh, offers obvious advantages, which are stressed by Manu (p. 41). Bṛhaspati gives detailed directions for equipping such a fortress to stand a siege. Craftsmen of all kinds, soldiers, cattle, horses as well as elephants, siege engines, and munitions of war and weapons, besides every kind of food, should be kept there. But, true to the beliefs of the age in supernatural agencies affording, when placated, the best of all protection, the king is advised to keep in all such fortresses a number of Brāhmaṇas, learned in the Vedas and maintaining the sacred fire (***Vedavidyāvido viprān agnihotrinaḥ***), so that they may perform the various periodical and special sacrifices and ceremonies for the king and subjects. They should be freed from any kind of contribution (p. 41). If a king has a choice of settling where he pleases, he is advised to select a region which is fertile and salubrious, peopled by Āryas, has a docile baronage, and is independent of the fickle seasonal rainfall. But, inacces- sibility to the foe is the most important merit to be looked for. When the Rājput states of Hindusthān were overthrown by the Musulmans in the 12th century, the fugitives sought refuge in the deserts of Rājputāna and in the Himālayan fastnesses.

CONSTRUCTION OF A TUWN

  Lakṣmidhara, liko his successors, devotes much space to the rules for constructing a town, and for building in it different types of buildings. The extracts he gives throw light on ancient town planning. The town should be walled all found, and there should be gates and a flag-staff in a central position (p. 42). A scheme of squares, oue within another, with streets between, ie recommended. In the centre must be the temple. In the square surrounding it, the king's palace with its outhouses should be built, and in the third the houer of the chief judge and the courts of law (p. 42). The treasury, the elephant stubles, and the arsenal should be to the south of the palace, which should face east. To the north of it i,e, to the left of it, should be built the royal kitchen (***mahānasa***), the quarters of the royal chaplain (***purodka***), the minister and the royal physician. The distribution obvioualy is diotated by convenience, and it is to be found in most old Indian capitals, in which the structures of the pre-Muslimperiod have survived. Much further advice is given, based partly on mystic baliefs, in the good or bad luck that altends specifie locations, and partly on experience. The fortress should not be crowded with unnecessary people (***na bahūnām ato durgam vinā karyām tako bhavet***). Among means of defence it is Interesting to note the advice to keep deadly subms in pots, to be thrown on the attacking enemy (p. 46). Another interesting suggestion is to have various condiments prepared from named ingredients, which have nourishing and hunger resisting properties (pp. 46-47). They were for use in a prolonged siege, during which provisionsran short. The erection of temples to divinities, who are named, is recommended. It will procure their protection to the fortress and city. But, the direct One of vision (***dṛiṣṭi***) of some deities can be fatal, while that of others is beneficial. This should guide the location and erection of public and private buildings(pp. 53-54). The interruption of the direct line of vision of some delties, e.g. Devi, bodes misfortune, No building directly in front of their temples should be built. It is lucky to build the shrines of some deities only at stated parts of the city and inauspicions in others. This is an extention of the old belief in the 'evil eye.' The idea is found in Indian astrology,

where malefic or beneficial " aspects" (***vikṣaṇa***) form vital elements in the selection of suitable moments for action. Cettain moments represent invisible channels of time, in which one can progress safely and certain others the converse (pp. 55- 56). The site chosen should possess good features and mystic virtues. The inspection of the site (***vāstu-parikṣa***) is an essential preliminary to building on it. The laying of the foundation should be preceded by the worship or the placation of superhuman beings (pp. 58-60). The planting of trees, except in specified places in relation to a residence, may bring had luck (p. 69), such as loss of wife or children, and, in the case of a king, of subjects (***prajā-hāni***). The first entry into a newly built house or palace should be made at an auspicious moment, and after specified ritual (***grhapravesavidhiḥ,*** pp. 70- 73). There are definite rules, largely empirical, even for gather- ing the timber for construction (***dārvāharaṇa-vidhiḥ***, pp. 73-74). The royal flag-staff should conform to specifications (***dhvajalakṣaṇam***, pp. 73-76). The antiquity of the tests applied to the selection of sites is shown by the quotation from the ancient ***Gṛhya-sūtra*** of Āsvalāyana (***Bahvṛea-gṛhya***) reproduced on pp. 76-77, which is typical of what is found in other ***gṛhyasūtras*** also. There is, in the rules furnished in the ***sūtras***, the mixture of good building knowledge and much mysticism. The Purāṇic extracts, which are quoted, merely summarize and para- phrase what is found in the older sutras. The rules are thephrase what is found in the older ***sūtras***. The rules are the same for public or private dwellings and the directions to the king are to be deduced from those to the *Kṣatriya*. The welfare of the king and the state demands attention to the taboos and the prescriptions that are designed to ensure luck. A Dharma digest excludes black magic.

FORCES (DAṆḌA)

  The only remaining element of ***sāptāṇga*** is ***Daṇḍa***, which is interpreted as ***Senă***, armed force. It is so called as with it alone is chastisement (***daṇḍa***) of the enemy or rebels possible. The chapter in which Lakṣmīdhara deals with the armed forces is the shortest in the book. It consists of two verses from the ***Mahābhārata***, selected from Bhiṣma's summary of the contents

of the encyclopaedic treatise composed by Brahmā, which dealt with Rājadharma (***Śantiparva***, ed. Kumbakonam, ch. 58, sl. 40-41). They indicate two divisions of the forces of the state, open and secret, the first of eight classes and the second of many types. The eight-fold senāconsists of chariots, elephants, cavalry, infantry, conscripts (***viṣṭi***), navy, intelligence corps (***carāḥ***) and guides (***deśikaḥ***). Lakṣmīdhara interprets visti as "compulsorily impressed labour corps" (***balātkāreņa ākṛṣṭaḥ karmkāriṇaḥ***) and "***desikā***" as 'natives'. The last interpretation seems as incorrect as that of the commentator on the ***Mahabhārata*** (XII, p. 92) who explains it as "teachers who instruct." Neither suits the context. If it means "persons born in the country" it must be "these of the ***invaded*** country." It is noteworthy that nothing is said about the troops being made up of ***kṣatriyas*** only. Even before the days of Kauṭilya the army was recruited from all castes, and he discusses the relative fighting value of recruits from each [varṇa](# " 'ब्राह्मण-क्षत्रिय-वैश्यशूद्रसैन्यानां तेजः प्रधान्यात् पूर्वं पूर्वं श्रेयः सन्नाहयितुम्'इत्याचार्याः । नेति कौटिल्यः। प्रणिपातेन ब्राह्मबलं परोऽभिहारयेत् । प्रहरणविद्याविनीतं तु क्षत्रियबलं श्रेयः, बहुलसारं वा वैश्यशूद्रबलमिति ॥ (९, २., पृ. ३४३) ।"). Manu (p. 247) advises the soldiers recruited from the inhabitants of Kurukṣetrn, Mātsya, Pancala, and S'ūrasena (i.e., the area between Thanesar and Muttra) to be placed in the van of battle, as "shock" troops. The ordinary soldier was apparently a salaried servant. Nārada places him in the highest class of paid servants, judged by [remuneration](# "भृतकस्त्रिविधो ज्ञेय उत्तमो मध्यमोऽधमः । शक्तिभक्त्यानुरूपा स्यादेषां कर्माश्रयामृतिः । उत्तस्त्वायुधीयोऽत्र मध्यमस्तु कृषीवलः । अधमो मारवाहस्स्यादित्येव त्रिविधो- भृतः ॥ (५, २२-२३, पृ १४५) ।"). Lakṣmīdhara concurs in the view that even a small army, which is loyal, well-fed and in good spirits, can acquit itself remarkably-" conquer the earth" (***mahīm jayati)***—the implication being that the troops should be well looked after and kept contented and cheerful.Training, proper leadership, and good pay are stressed by [Kāmandaka](# "पितृपैतामहो वश्यः रांहतो दत्तवेतनः । विख्यातपौरुषो जन्यः कुशलः कुशलैर्वृतः ॥ नानाप्रहरणोपेतो नानायुद्धविशारदः । नानायोधसमाकीर्णे नीराजितहयद्विपः ॥ प्रवासायासदुःखेषु युद्धेषु च कृतश्रमः । अद्वैभ्यः क्षत्रियप्रायो दण्डो दण्डविदां मतः ॥ (कामन्दक, ४, ६३, ६५ ).")as necessary for military efficiency. He also

envisages a standing army -i.e., which has served father and grandfather, ***pitṛ-paitamaha***.

OPERATIONS OF WAR

  The directions for the conduct of military operations should follow logically the section on armed forces (***Daṇḍa***), but Lakşmidhara treats the subject under the six-fold expedient (***sād-guppa***) and expedients (***upāya***). The procedure is also followed by Mitramis'ra (pp. 328-412). War, considered as one of the six expedients, is technically termed yāna (march), but Lakşmīdhara and Mitramisra prefer the term ***yātrā*** for it. The choice of suitable time for the expedition is first discussed. Naturally, it will be available only to the power that takes the initiative. It will not be possible in defensive war. The attack is to be directed against the capital of the enemy (***yāyād*** ***aripuramsanaiḥ***), which is the ultimate objective of the campaign. The adverb sanaiḥ ('slowly') indicates that the march through hostile territory will be contested and will have necessarily to be slow. The concentration of the resources of a state in a fortified capital makes its capture the decisive act of the campaign. One interpretation of the obscure expression ***dvaidht-bhava***, which has been explained in different [ways](# "Cf. Medhātithi on Manu, VII, 160 and VII, 167 Kāmandaka, X, 24-27, and Kauṭilya, VII, 1 and 7 (p. 264 and pp. 280-284)."),is this, viz., that this concentration of resources and forces should be given up, when a division is rendered necessary by the fear of the enemy encircling the army. The king is advised by Manu (inf. p. 114) to commence the campaign in "the auspicous month of ***Mārgasirga***", or 'according to his resources' in the months of ***Phālguna*** and ***Caitra***. He may begin operations in any other month, provided victory is virtually certain owing to the difficulties of the enemy (***vyasane votthite ripoḥ***). The reasons for the advice are thus stated by Medhātithi. "In ***Mārgasirsa*** (December-January) the autumn harvest would have been garnered, and the invader will be cheered by the prospect of having also his spring harvest. The time is good for siege operations. The rivers will then be running low, the ground hard, and there will be no over-growth of jungle through which the army will have to march. The

season will also be neither too hot nor too cold." " At any other season, food grains, though sufficient, will not be diversified in kind and quality, the season of three harvests being far off. Further, at other seasons the enemy can take shelter under a powerful king. This will dissipate the grain stock of both combatants, and the attacking forces will be weakened." "If, however, the invader is only anxious to inflict some injury on the enemy, the expedition is expected to be of short duration and the invading forces are quite strong, the invasion may take place in ***Phālguna*** or ***Caitra*** ( March-May ), especially if the country which is to be attacked is rich in spring harvests. The invader can be sure then of adequate fodder supplies and will also be able to destroy the spring crops in the invaded [country.](# "Trn. ( Jha ), III, pp. 390-391.")" The time chosen must also be suitable to the utilization of the particular part of the army, in which the invader is most strong: infantry and elephants can be used in rains ( ***padāti-nāga-bahulām senām prāvrişi yojayet,*** inf. p. 123 ). Summer is suitable for the operations of a camel corps ( **kharoṣṭra- bahulām senām tathā grīṣme**). Every arm of the forces can be used only in sarat ( end of Autumn ) and vasanta ( Spring ). Before using any particular section of the army the terrain must be carefully studied. Thus, chariots need hard, level ground. A king who is strong in one arm more than others should select both the route and the time most suitable for its use.

  Strategy and tactics are for the trained ***Senāpati*** ( generalissimo ). War experience in ancient India had crystallized into certain general principles of military evolution. Fancied resemblance to certain objects or animals gave to each type or formation ( ***vyūha*** ) its technical name e.g., the needle' ( ***sūcī*** ), the 'thunderbolt' ( ***vajra*** ), the ‘swan' ( ***hamsa*** ), the 'lotus' ( ***padma*** ), the staff' ( ***daṇḍa*** ) etc. Their indication, as mere illustrations ( Manu, VII, 191 ), suggests that the struggle was to be on both sides conducted according to well-understood principles of strategy. This implies adequate training and discipline, which alone will make it possible for quick changes to be made in formations, and for the habituation of the armies to recognized rules of war. The second aspect is very important in view of the insistence

in Rajadharma on the conduct of the war in accordance with stringent rules, penalizing practices, that were deemed inequitable.

  Thus it is lawful to a kingdom which has been invaded to apply the principle of the "scorched earth." It is allowed to lay waste the open country, to destroy standing crops and the bunds of irrigation reservoirs, to flood the country, to pull down fortifications and buildings, which may be useful to the invader, and to burn up grain stores. "The ( defending ) king shall gather for himself all the corn; what he cannot take away, he should burn; all standing crops should be destroyed; fords and bridges should be destroyed; water from reservoirs should be let out; stagnant water, as also wells, should be rendered unfit for drinking; jungle near the beleaguered fortress should be burnt: the branches of larger trees should be lopped off, if they are beyond the glacis." ( p. 125 ). The aim is to prevent an invader from living off the land, while carrying on a siege, or advance under cover. The same destruction practised by an invader will be another matter, and will not be allowable. A surprise attack at night is permissible, but only to create confusion and panic in the enemy.' (Manu, VII, 180). It is forbidden to kill men while' asleep (ib. VII, 92).

  The aim of the expedition ( ***yātrā*** ) is to bring the enemy to his knees, but it is allowable to effect it only by '[lawful](# "Mahabharata, Sauptika-parva, 8.") ' methods. Non-combatants cannot be slain. Megasthenes noted that the cultivators, "at the very time when a battle was going on might be seen quietly pursuing their work of ploughing or digging [unmolested.](# "In explaining 'bhrsa-daṇdastu satruşu' in Manu, VII, 32, Medhätithi explains that the invader should not destroy the inhabitants in the invaded kingdom, if it is at all possible to save them : परराष्ट्रवासिनोऽपि राष्ट्रघातकाले यदि शक्यन्ते रक्षितुं तदा न हन्यन्ते । For Megasthenes, see Camb. Hist. of India, I, p. 410.")" But, in the heat of battle, it is difficult to enforce the ethical rules of a military code. In his Thirteenth Rock Edict, Asoka states that in his war against Kalinga, 150,000 were taken prisoners, 100000 persons (apparently combatants) were slain, “and many times as many died." Violence, death and banishment are inevitable," he states in poignant repentance, even for householders, and ascetics, if a country

hitherto unconquered is [conquered.](# "See Bhandarkar's Asoka, p. 329, As'oka views the slaughter in the war as not characteristic of ' righteous war' ( dharmavijaya ), which will henceforth be the ideal of his future conquests: येषेच मुखमुते विजये देवनप्रियस यो भ्रमविजयो ( २० ) (Shāhabhazgarhi Text).")" The aged and the sick, women and children, Brāhmaṇas, students, and the outcaste cannot be slain. Nor can persons without weapons or armour, or those who have laid down their arms and surrendered. prisoner cannot be maltreated. The use of weapons which cause needless pain (liked barbed arrows, which lacerate the flesh ), or which are poisoned or of flame-throwers is [forbidden.](# " न कर्णिभिः न दिग्धैः प्रहरेत् ( बौधायन ध. सू. १, १८, १० ) । CE. Mahā- bhāraia, S'āntiparva, 95, 11- नेषुर्लिप्तो न कर्णी स्यात् असतामेतदायुधम्I vide infra p. 131. Manu's Kūṭayuddha (concealed weapon ') will include modern 'booby- traps' and land-mines. Most weapons of modern warfare will be outlawed by Hindu Dharma. Medhātithi ( VII, 90 ) describes the Karṇika, as an arrow whose tip or middle is ear-shaped, with keen edges, which makes it difficult to withdraw the arrow, without tearing the flesh, Expanding bullets were once outlawed on similar grounds.")Fugitives cannot be pursued and [killed](# "आपस्तंब धर्म, २,१०, ११, यथा-न्यस्तायुध- प्रकीर्णकेश- प्राञ्जलि पराङ्मुखवृत्तानामार्यावधं परिचक्षेत् ।") ( Āpastamba II, 10. 11 ).

  ***Kūṭa-yuddha***, war by secret and unregenerate methods, is absolutely forbidden in Rājadharma. An open fight is expected. An ambush ( sattraḥ ) comes under ***kūṭa-yuddha***. A king can be slain even in battle only by a king. The ***Nitisāstra*** allows ***kūta-yuddha***. A chapter of the [***Kauțiliya***](# " Bk. X, ch, 3.")( X, 3 ) is devoted to it. Kāmandaka defends it and argues that for the destruction of a foe the use of stratagems is necessary. He holds that it does not violate Dharma ( ***na hi tirayati dharmam*** ). He refers with approval to the notorious nocturnal attack made by Asvatthāman on the sleeping Pandava host, and its destruction when lying unsuspicious of such an unfair [attack.](# " कामन्दकीये ( १९, ७१ ) यथा - सुनियतमुपहन्यात् कूटयुद्धेन शत्रून् न हि तिरयति धर्मं छद्मना शत्रुघातः । अचकितमवसुप्तं पाण्डवानामनीकं निशि सुनिशितशस्त्रो द्रोणसूनु र्जधान ॥") Lakṣmīdhara's loyalty to the ancient principles of righteous war (***dharmayuddha*** ) is reflected in his omission of authorities sanctioning ***kūṭa-yuddha***. Yājñavalkya ( I, 323 ) restricts entry to heaven only to those who fight fair and die in battle doing so. Since a battle is described as a ***yajña*** ( sacrifice ), it cannot be

a ***Yajña***, if it is waged unfairly. The deterioration of moral standards after the Muslim conquest of India is reflected in the open manner in which the defence of kita-yuddha in the ***Kāmandakīya*** is quoted with approval in Bhaṭṭa Nilakantha's treatise. The use of chivalrous methods in fighting a ruthless enemy, who will not follow them, was a serious handicap to the Rajput dynasties, on whom fell the brunt of the Muslim attack.

  Equity and wisdom dictate considerate treatment of a conquered enemy. When a king is overthrown or killed, his state is not to be destroyed, and his kingdom dismembered or annexed. Enemy subjects are immune from maltreatment; for, as Kātyāyana points out, the war was not waged with their sanction ( p. 139 ). A defeated kingdom must be allowed to function as of old, though as a tributary. Its ancient customs and laws must be conserved and left to function as in the past. Compelling a conquered people, on any ground, to adopt the laws and customs of the conqueror, is repugnant to both Dharma and [***Nīti***.](# " शुक्रनीतिसार, ४, ८, ८०१.")Not only do smrtis like those of Manu ( VII, 203 ), Vişņu ( 3, 42 ) and Yajñavulkya [( I, 342 )](# "inf. pp. 138-139.")insist on the equity of preserving the constitution and laws of the conquered kingdom and the conservation of its customs, but on grounds of prudence also, the same injunction is given by Kauṭilya, who goes so far as to advise the conqueror to make himself acceptable to the conquered people by adopting himself their modes of life, customs, dress and [language](# "XIII, 5 Modern conquerors have also adopted these methods of conciliation."). It may be remembered that this was done by Alexander the Great after the conquest of Persia. The sins of the conquered ruler are not to be visited on his people or state. "Even though the enemy may have been wicked" says Katyāyana ( VM. p. 411 ), " the conqueror should not destroy his kingdom." After victory, the conqueror is enjoined by Manu ( VII, 201 ) to grant cultivators in the conquered kingdom remissions of taxes, for one or two years, in order that those who had already suffered in the war, might not suffer f[urthe](# "मेधातिथि ( ७, २०१ ) र्यथा - कुटुबिनां परिहारार्थं स्थितिः यथावृत विशिष्टकर - भारशुल्कप्रवेशानां प्रदानेन तथा तथा वा संवत्सरमेको द्वयो वा दद्यात् । उच्चानां पौरजानपदबलानां स्थापयेत् – “तैः यैः स्वाम्यनुरागात अस्थानमुपचितं तेषामपि आरक्षान्तं यथा स्वं स्वं व्यापारं अनुतिष्ठन्तु ” इति ।")r. A

general amnesty is to be proclaimed. No one is to be penalized for his loyalty to his king, or, for what we now call "war-guilt." If, after all these gracious acts, the conqueror finds the people still devoted to their old rulers, he should set on the throne a member of the old dynasty. Rājadharma does not sanction the exaction of territorial concessions from a conquered [enemy](# "शान्तिपर्वणि, ९६, २०, यथा--"),or of an indemnity to cover the cost of the war. A king is indeed described as making war for getting additional territory, but it clearly signifies supremacy rather than annexation. To compel cessions of territory or to insist on indemnities is akin to ***asura-vijaya***, not ***dharma-[vijaya](# "जित्वा न हरति द्रव्यं स नृपः स्वर्गमाश्रितः ।").*** Conquered territory should be gradually evacuated.

**BOOTY**

  It is contrary to Rājadharma to sack a captured town. Booty is defined as only what is taken on the field of battle, and it does not include loot. All booty belongs in theory to the king. The smṛtis state some exceptions to this principle. The old rule of Gautama [(I, 20-23)](# "This is why the king is enjoined to mark the behaviour of his soldiers in battle (Manu, VII, 194, infra p. 130).")is that the soldier gets the spoils, but chariots and riding animals belong to the king, even if they have been won by a private in single combat. All other booty, goes to the common stock from which the kingwill make suitable rewards to those who deserve them for their contribution to the [victory](# "'स्वर्ण रूप्य-भूम्याबसकादि राज्ञ एव । एवमर्थं परिगणितम् । आयुधसंवाहनानि राज्ञ एव । धान्यादीनां पृथगुपादानात् धनशब्देन गो-महिष्यादिकमुच्यते । तथा राजधनवार्धमिति प्रयक्षते "). In Manu, (VII. 96) the old rule is relaxed in favour of the soldier. He can hold what he has won, if it be chariots, elephants, umbrellas, grain, animals and women. Medhātithi rules that everything else must go to the king, viz. arms, conveyances, gold, silver, buildings, cattle [etc](# "See W. J. Wilson, History of the Madras Army, 1882, I, 120, 160; II, 336-339; IV, 193-212. In 1758 the Crown transferred by letters patent its rights to all plunder taken by their troops and ships to the East India Company. After this was done, the Company of its own accord consented to one half of all such booty (or prize money) being given to the troops with the exception of cannon, military stores and ammunition. The distribution of prize money raised many undignified and acrimonious controversies after every war,").

Even the soldier who gets his share of the booty should volun tarily present a choice object to the king (Manu, VII, 97). These wholesome rules are obviously intended to prevent indis criminate plunder and such scramble for the spoils of the war, as was to become an ugly feature of the campaigns of the East India Company.

  War conducted on the lines laid down by Rājadharma has the great merit of not leaving behind any lasting bitterness among a conquered people or of generating in them a hankering for revenge, such as would lead to another war. Rājadharma wisely recognized that moderation in victory gives the only real assurance of lasting peace. The struggle for supremacy among rulers was not to degenerate into wars of peoples.

  Except world opinion, there is no other sanction behind the humane principles of war enunciated by Dharmusāstra. Violations of the rules of chivalrous war can only be visited by public condemnation. The treacheries in the war, which preceded the accession of Iarsa (608 A..) roused universal [reprobation](# "Harṣa's brother Rājyavardhana was treacherously assassinated. His sister Rājyas’ri was married to Grahavarman, the Maukhāri king of Kanauj. He was defeated and killed, and Rajyas'ri, was imprisoned with ")In the struggles between the Calukyas and the Pallavas their respective capitals were burnt [down.](# "Kānci, the Pallava capital was sacked by the Cālukya Pulakesin II (c. 609 A.

The harsh and ignominious treatment accorded to the heroic Muñja (Vākpatirāja), after sixteen successful compaigns, by his old foo the Cālukya Tailaapa, roused the indignation and horror of his [contemporaries.](# "Ibid, p. 432. See, Merutunga's Prabandha-cintamani, which describes Muñja's sufferings (pp. 34-35), and D. C. Gangoly--History of the Paramara Dynasty, 1933, pp. 56-61. Muñja, like Belisarius, had to beg his food in the streets, before being put to death.")

ETHICS OF VIOLENC

  War is the last resort of kings. It is not to be started hastily. The injunction to try every means of averting it is due less to the dislike of the evil that it brings in its train to both combatants and to non-combatants than to the uncertainty

of victory for the king who starts the war. The fortunes of war are governed by visible and invisible causes. Precautions may be taken against the former. To avert disaster due to the latter, the only course is to secure superhuman support. While ahimsā, aversion to inflict pain, is held up as an ideal of personal conduct, it is recognized that it is impossible to avoid the infliction of pain in the universe as constituted. He who inflicts pain accumulates ***duṣ-karma***. Its effects will survive death and pursue him in after-life. Pantheism and the doctrine of the all-pervasive Ātman combine to restrain the disposition to hurt. But infliction of pain is often needed for ultimate relief. A teacher who punishes a refractory pupil causes immediate pain for the reformation and ultimate good of the pupil. The physician causes pain in order to banish it altogether from the patient. The king restrains and punishes wrong-doers, so that they may be purified by punishment, others might take a lesson from their fate [and](# "Mahābhārata, Anusāsana, 227, 3-5. See Sir P. S. Sivaswami Aiyer, Ahimsāand Asaṅga, 1941, passim.") avoid similar wrong-doing, and in order to protect the people. One may hurt an assailant in self-defence, or oppressors of the poor and the [helpless](# " Manusmrti, VIII, 350, and Mahābhārata, Sāntiparva, 14, 89- आततायिनमायान्तं अपि वेदान्तपारगम् । जिघांसन्तं जिघांसीयान्न तेन भ्रूणहा भवेत् ।")

Pain may be caused by carrying out the Vedic injunctions in animal sacrifices. The ***himsā***caused in such sacrifices is declared to be ***[ahimsā](# " Manusmṛti, v, 44या वेदविहिता हिंसा नियताऽस्मिन् चराचरे । अहिंसामेव तां विद्यात् वेदाद्धर्मो हि निर्वभौ ।")***

***.*** One may be outraged by the sight of harm done or impending to Brāhmaṇņas, cows and women and take up arms to defend them, using violence to resist [violence](# "Ibid. X, 62 - ब्राह्मणार्थं गवार्थे वा देहत्यागोऽनुपस्कृतः । स्त्रीबालाभ्युपपत्तौ च बाह्यानां सिद्धिकारणम् ।Even persons who are ont-castes are redeemed by such acts.")



.One may take up arms in defence of his home and country. Lastly, a person may be obliged to fight because he is engaged on a salary to fight for his master, or it may be a matter of duty to him, owing to his ***varṇa***. A ***kṣatriya*** should not die in [bed](# " Viṣṇusmṛti, 3, 44- नास्ति राज्ञांसमरे तनुत्यागसदृशो धर्मः। Mahābhārata, Sāntiparva, 97, 23.25 – अधर्मः क्षत्रियस्यैष यच्छय्यामरणं भवेत् । विसृजन् श्लेष्मपित्तानि")

. In every one of these cases, the

violence or pain that is caused is not merely defensible but is positively meritorious. It is the aim of man to overcome sin. Among the many ways of doing so is the performance of the horse-sacrifice (***Asvamedha***). Even a mortal sin like that resulting from the murder of a Brāhmaṇa is destroyed by the performance of the horse-sacrifice. There is Vedic authority for the [belief](# "अपि चैतेन ब्रह्महत्यामतरत् सर्वं पाप्मानं तरति ब्रह्महत्यां योऽश्वमेधेन यजते (तैतरीय- संहिता, fear, ५, ३, १२, १, २). See also Gautama, 19, 9 and Vasiṣṭha, 22, 6."). According to Gautama and Manu, if the murderer of a Brāhmaṇa first confesses his guilt and then bathes in the water in which the king, who has completed the horse sacrifice, has had his lustration, he is freed from his [sin](# "Manusmṛti, XI, 82- शिष्ट्वा वा भूमिदेवानां नरदेवसमागमे । स्वमेनोऽवभूतस्नातोहयमेधे विमुच्यते ।").It was a matter of caste prestige for a ***kṣatriya*** to do the horse [sacrifice](# "Its complexity, difficulty and rarity raised the prestige of the Kṣatriya who performed it."). It enables a king to gain all his objects, gain all prosperity and win all victories if he performs it. The sacrifice will be ruined if an enemy gets hold of the sacrificial victim, i.c., the [horse](# "P, V. Kane-History of Dharmas'āstra, II, 1941, p. 1233,").Accordingly, only a powerful king can give the needed protection to the animal. Wars must result from the undertaking of this sacrifice.

  Again, loyalty to an ally, desire to extend one's dominion, and desire to obtain wealth may induce a ruler to make war.

  In all such cases, the test of real ***ahimsā***is its practicability. ***Ahimsā***becomes synonymous with needless infliction of pain.

  Once it is conceded that war is justifiable on ***varṇa-dharma*** or ***guna-dharma***, it becomes obligatory for combatants to do everything that would ensure success. The zealous exertion of the soldiers, or others who take part in the struggle, is needed for ultimate victory. Doubters must be reassured, slackers stirred up, the timorous heartened up, and assurances of advantages not realizable except through death in battle have to be held out to the fighters. A paid retainer or soldier, who refuses to fight for his master, is guilty of the sin of ingratitude

कृपणं परिदेवयेत्।अविक्षतेन वेहेन प्रलयं योऽधिगच्छति। क्षत्रियो नास्ति तत्कर्म प्रशंसन्ति पुराविदः। न गृहे मरणं तात क्षत्रियाणां प्रशस्यते।

(***kṛtaghnatā***). A kṣatriya cannot show his back to the enemy. In the quaint language of Yama (inf. p. 130) a ***kṣatriya*** has the Brāhmaṇa on his back,' and he must not expose him to the enemy. There is no higher duty for him than to die in battle. He who fights straight in battle (***akāṭairāyudhaiḥ***) and loses his life in it, goes to heaven, like a Yogi (Yājñavalkya I, 304). The ***kṣatriya*** who dies in defence of his people wins the same fruit as he who does a horse sacrifice (Devala, inf. p. 133). He goes to the heaven of Indra. He dwells there as long as there are particles of dust stained by the blood oozing from his wounds (inf. p. 133). There is no death equal in merit to that in battle for [kings](# "In 1250 A.D., Rāwal Chachik of Jaisālmir fearing the ignominy of death by mere age, begged the Langa prince of Multān to give him "). The king killed in defence of the property of Brāhmaṇas is the spirit of sacrifice incarnate (***sākṣāt yajñadharmaḥ*** p. 134). There is no greater sin for a ***kṣatriya*** than flying from a battle (Vyāsa, inf. p. 134). The soldier who flies from battle takes over all his ruler's sins, when he is killed in flight; and whatever merit he has accumulated till then goes to the king (Manu, inf. p. 135). Every step taken by one who deserts his king in battle is equal in sin to Brāhmaṇa-slaughter (Parāsara, p. 135 infra). There is no other way of requiting the king's wages than dying for him in battle (***Ādityapurāna, inf.*** p. 135). He who dies in battle stands in no need of the usual funeral ceremonies; he communicates no pollution to his relations by his death. Thousands of celestial damsels wait for the hero who dies in battle exclaiming "He will be our husband." The hero who listens unmoved to the tale of woe of a Brāhmaṇa,without going to his rescue, goes to Hell, (***inf***. p. 136).

Such are the exhortations to the soldier to fight to death. Lakṣmīdhara devotes much space to the topic. It is permissible to see in it the reaction to the conditions of his age, when the death struggle with the Muslim invader had begun, and it was vital that every Indian should be stirred up to the patriotic and pious duty of fighting for his king, country, culture and religion, and, if need be, of dying for them. Doubtless such appeals were addressed to soldiers before a campaign or a battle, and power- fully helped recruitment, mobilization and resolute fighting.

THE RĀJADHARMA KÂŅŅA

SUPERNATURAL SUPPORT

  The army would gain confidence from the knowledge that supernatural agencies had been enlisted by the king in its support. Happiness and suffering in this existence are not wholly due to the actions done in former births, but they affect the disposition, character and instincts of a person in this life. One's actions in this birth, as affected by the ***vāsanā***, the mental and moral traits, which constitute his initial equipment in life, may be responsible for his good fortune or bad luck. A wise ruler therefore tries to avert and to correct any tendencies to misfortune or ill-luck by taking precautions governing his own conduct, as well as by expiatory or propitiatory rites prescribed by his spiritual guides, Omens and portents must be carefully studied, partly because they convey warnings to a king not to run risks, and partly to suggest means of propitiation of the offended divinitics, whose displeasure bodes misfortune. Lakşmıdhara deals with such indications with some fulness. The king is also advised to pay heed to the warnings or hopes conveyed by dreams. Knowledgeof dream-lore is held essential in normal times and even more in the conduct of war (pp. 116-122). The health and efficiency of the army are ensured by the regular performance of ***ntrānjana***, or lustral purification, every year in the month of Āsvina, and again specially before an army is put on the field. This ceremony is not explicitly advised by Lakṣmīdhara, in the preparations for war, probably because it was a routine observance. Mitramisra and later writers deal with the rite very fully. Before the com- mencement of the march the king should take a 'bath of victory' (***jayābhişeka***), which should be followed up by a special nīrāñjana and a ***ghṛtakambaḷa-sānti*** (op.cit. pp. 340-396). The ritual is described from the ***Lingapurāṇa***, a work which Lakşmīdhara often draws upon. An ordinary püja to the gods should follow the victorious termination of the campaign (p. 137), and be accompanied by largesses to Brāhmaņas.

STANDING RELIGIOUS OBLIGATIONS

  Belief in the efficacy of the worship of the gods and of the performance of certain rites is responsible for the indication by

INTRODUCTION

Lakşmīdhara of such of them as seemed to him to be important enough to deserve special mention and description. The last seven chapters of his ***Rājadharmakāṇda*** are devoted to them. They are simply reproduced by Mitramisra. The Purāņas in- culcate the worship of many deities and the performance of numerous ceremonics. It has to be presumed that Lakṣmīdhara, who has furnished a list of seven of these, felt that they should not be neglected by a king who desired to be prosperous.

1\. DEVAYATRA (FESTIVALS IN HONOUR OF DEITIES)

  Certain ***tithis, nakṣatras*** and months are associated in sacred legends with particular divinities. To worship a deity on such a conjunction is specially efficacious, and the festivities in honour of the deity should ***terminate*** on that date. The first lunar day is sacred to Brahmā, the second to the goddess of learning, the third to Gangā, the fourth to Vinayaka, the fifth to the Nagas (serpents), the sixth to Skandha, the seventh to the Sun, the eighth to Rudra with his attendants as well as to Indra, the ninth to Durgā and the Mothers, the tenth to the Earth-goddess, the eleventh to the Creator and to Visvakarmā, the twelfth to Viṣṇu, the thirteenth to the God of Love ( Kāma ), the fourteenth to Kapardin, and the full-moon day to the Visvedevas and the Moon-god. All these come in the bright fortnight. In the dark half of the month, the Manes are worshipped on the New Moon, Yama (the god of Death) on the fourth and fourteenth. Every day is auspicious for the worship of the Supreme Being, Nārāyaṇa. The festivities are to last atleast seven days in each case. For each day particular duties in connection with the festival are indicated. These are all annual functions, and they are to take place in the temples concerned in the six months following ***Vaisākha***. They grant lasting prosperity (p. 181). In any kingdom in which these festivals and worship are neglected, the harvests are destroyed by floods or by drought, and famine and pestilence follow. The king's duty is to see that such calamities are averted by insisting on the due performance of the worship of the above gods (p. 181).

2\. KAUMUD

ī

-MAHOTSAVAM

  ***Kaumudīmahotsava*** is special festival dedicated to Śiva culminating on the full moon day in the month of ***Kārtika***. Its

THE RĀJADIIARMA KÂṆḌA

special feature is illumination of all houses during the whole month preceding, practice still followed. Animal sacrifice on the days is enjoined for the king, who is to take the lead in organizing and observing the festival.

3\. INDRA-DHVAJOCCIIRĀYA (RAISING A FLAG STAFF OF INDRA)

  The ceremony consists in the erection of a flag-staff on the eighth day of the bright fortnight in the month of ***Bhādrapada*** ( August-September ), or on the day in which the constellation Śravana occurs in the bright fortnight of the month of ***Āsvina***. It is a public ceremony to be done by the king himself, with due pomp, attended by his court ( p. 189 ). The erection of this flag-staff and its worship, according to a ritual, which is fully described, destroys all threats to the kingdom (***samasta ghorāṇām nāsanam***) and ensures constant victory ( jayadam ). The staff represents the staff of victory, which Vişnu obtained from S'iva. From Ilim it passed on in succession to Brahmã, Indra, Soma and the patriarch ( ***Prajāpati*** ) Dakṣa. From the days of Dakşa, kings are said to raise this flag-staff. The king who annually erects it becomes the lord of the world and his kingdom never suffers from want of rain ( p. 190 ). Elaborate rules are given in regard to the choice of the tree for the flag-staff. It should be one of seven named kinds, and be absolutely flawless. It should not break or get injured when cut down or transported, as various misfortunes will follow such mishaps, e.g. death of the queen. The pole should be crowned with a banner. It should not become a roosting place for inauspicious birds. On the night of its erection, the king and his priests should keep awake to guard it. The staff itself should be worshipped with appropriate Vedic hymns. Lakṣmīdhara's account is extracted from the ***Devīpurāṇa***. There is in the ***Mahābhārata*** an account of the gift of a banner ( ***dhvaja***) by Indra to king Uparicara of Cedi, of his ceremonious worship of it, displayed on a pole in a special festival, of Indra's pleasure thereon, and his pledge that who-soever celebrated the festival shall be free of all calamities and be assured of victories ( ***Ādibarva***, 64 36-38 ). The flag-staff is represented

INTRODUCTION

there as standing for India. Literary references show that the erection of the pole was the signal for the commencement of popular festivities in a kingdom. Neither Nīlakaṇṭha nor Anantadeva has prescribed the festival, for the good of the state, as Lakṣmīdhara and Mitramisra have done.

4\. DEV

ī

PŪJA IN [NAVARĀTRI](# "Ibid., pp. 178-181")

  The nine days beginning with the New Moon in the month of ***Kānya*** (September-October) are prescribed for ***pūjas***, to the three goddesses, Durgā, Sarasvatī and Lakṣmī. The ***Devipurāṇa*** enjoins the worship of Durgā, in her aspect as the destroyer of the buffalo-demon (***Mahiṣāsura-mardini***), on the night of the eighth lunar day. After worship, the king is to decapitate with his sword at midnight a sacrificial animal (***pasu***), and the blood of the victim is to be offered to the god ***Niruti*** (p. 194). The night is to be spent in worship of the goddess and the Mothers, and followed up next day by a procession in which the image of the goddess is taken round in a festal car. The sacrifice is prescribed for the attainment of fame, sovereignty, children, longevity and wealth (***yaśo-rājya-putrāyur-dhanam***). This popular Śakta rite is still celebrated in many parts of India on the night specified, but the victim is now a buffalo,

5\. CHIḤNA-PŪJĀ( WORSHIP OF EMBLEMS )

  Another form of worship prescribed for kings, to ensure every form of prosperity to the king and kingdom, is that of the goddess Durgā, in different ***pictorial*** representation, each of which stands for her in one of her aspects. Worshipped as  
***Umã***, mounted on a lion, she destroys the king's enemies. The same result is attained by worshipping her as ***Mahāmāya***, mounted on a monkey. Worshipped as mounted on the bird Garuḍa, she destroys epidemics, and so forth. For con- venience, the pictures are to be drawn on banners, which are then to be worshipped.

6\. GAVOTSARGA ( LIBERATION of Cows )

  A number of cows, after being decked and worshipped with Vedic ***mantras***, are to be marched between two upright poles,

  THE KĀJADHARMA KĀṇḌA

then tied up and finally let loose. It is to be done on the new moon in the month of ***Kārtika*** (October-November). Its fruit is relief of the kingdom from the six traditional calamities (***ṣaḍ-îtayaḥ***) ***viz***., excessive rain, failure of rain, rat pest, locust- invasion, birds which eat away unharvested grain, and royal avarice. The last benefit shows that the commendation of the ceremony is even more in the interests of the subjects than of their ruler.

7. VASORDHĀRĀ

  The last of the rites recommended for kings by Lakṣmīdhara is the ***Vasordhārā***. The word means 'stream of [wealth,](# "Ibid, pp. 825-826 for a description of the Indra-dhvaja ceremony from the Kausika-sültra. It is often referred to as Indramakha. See Brhatsamhita, ch. 43 for a story of its origin.")and refers to a thin stream of some liquid, usually clarified butter, (***ā******jya*** ), which is made to trickle slowly and continuously through a minute hole made at the bottom of a metal vessel hung above the fire-pit ( ***agni-kuṇḍa*** ). The rite is ancient, and is described in the Vedic Samhitas. In the Vedic ritual the stream of fluid flows from a sruk made of ***udumbara*** wood, which after the ceremony, is thrown into the Fire. The Fire god ( Agni ) is all-powerful. The object of the rite to secure for the sacrificer all the powers of the god. In the ***Purâņas***, the rite has been modified. The power in the Fire is described there as due not to Agni but to a more potent deity rosiding in the Fire. In the passages extracted by Lakṣmidhara, the divinity is described as Devi, who is specially pleased by this form of adoration. She is worshipped as above because she grants all wishes (***sarvakāma-pradāyikā,*** p. 201). She resides in the Fire (***vaḥnisthā***). Every deity, approached through the Fire, grants some wish of the sacrificer. It is more so with Devī. In the Puranic ritual, which is reproduced in the text, a special building is asked to be erected for the ceremony (p. 203). A fire-pit (***ku******ṇḍ******a***), preferably square in shape (***sākram***), is to be made in the middle of the hut. The vessel from which the ghṛta (clarified butter) is to trickle down should be of gold, silver, or copper. The oily stream should descend neither too fast

INTRODUCTION

nor too slow. Devi is to be approached by her ***mūla-mantra***, and the Fire is to be adored by the homa of ***mahā-vyāhṛti.*** Many deities are to be conceived as then present in the Fire ( and latent in Devī ). They are to be invoked with appropriate ***mantras***. A prayer which is to be addressed to the Fire-god is also furnished ( p. 206 ). The Fire is to be watched as its appearance will indicate the good or bad results that will flow from the ceremony. The effects of the rite may be strengthened by uttering specified special mantras ( e.g. ***mṛtyumjaya*** ). The value of the rite is greatest in destroying the enemies of a king ( p. 211). But, the rite should not be treated as a substitute for the daily worship of the Fire by the King. All occasions are good for the performance of the rite, e.g. the anniversary of the coronation, the birth of a prince, the solstices, eclipses, the appearance of terrifying portents and rites for counteracting adverse planetary influences (***graha-kṛtyopas'amane,*** p. 211). The benefits accruing to the king who performs the ***Vasordhāra*** are described with laudatory exaggeration, in a form which will make a powerful appeal to rulers and their advisers. Faith in its all-round power to ward off evils that threaten a king or kingdom is the justification for the inclusion of this comprehensive rite in a compendium meant for the guidance of kings.

  The underlying idea in this rite is the response of Indra and the gods to sacrifices in their honour. Kalidāsa expresses the idea [prettily](# "Raghuvamsa, I 26-दुदोह गां स यज्ञाय सस्याय मघवा दिवम् । संपद्विनिमये- नोभौ दधतुंर्भुवनत्रयम् ॥"). His hero, Dilīpa milked the Earth for the gods, and Indra milked the heavens for their fertilizing showers. From this to the idea of a shower of wealth falling over the head of a royal sacrificer is only a step forward. The trickling of the ***ghṛta*** on the Fire, which is the universal agent of all the gods, is mimetic. It is a visible ***vasordhārā***. The shower of blessings is invisible, but follows on the heels of the sacrifice. Ananda K. Coomaraswamy points to a pictorial representation of the idea in Amaravati. A seated emperor ( ***cakravartin*** ) is holding up his right arm, and a shower of coins is falling over his head. That is the divine response to the [sacrifice.](# "See his Spiritual Authority and Temporal Power in Angient India,")

THE RĀJADHARMA KĀŅDA

  ***Śākta*** influences, which had become very powerful in the days of Lakṣmīdhara, substituted Durga for the Vedic gods, as present in the Fire or approached by offerings poured into the ***agni-kuṇḍa***. The appeal of a rite, which promises to avert evil, in a time of peril and anxiety, is more powerful than that of one which offers only positive benefits. The drafts made on the Śākta Upa-Purāṇas, like the Devipurāṇaand the ***Kālikāpurāṇa***, by Lakṣmīdhara, in many parts of his digest, reflect the new spirit.

FREEDOM AND DESTINY: ROYAL ABHAYA

  The definition of the scope and inter-relations of Freedom and Destiny, (Paurușa and Daiva ) in Rājadharma has a specific aim. It is to infuse into the ruler a feeling of devont submission to God, and to Dharma, which derives its sanction from Ilim, and at the same time to teach him that only by his own exertion will his own duty, both as a man and as a king, be discharged properly. The magnification of the office and person of the king has two aspects: the exaltation of his position and the intensification of his personal responsibility. It is rank impiety for a ruler to become a fatalist, and allow things to drift. It is both foolish and futile for him to try to shift the burden of government as well as responsibility, to the shoulders of ministers, as the transfer will not relieve him of his personal liability. A king can shift his burden only to a successor. The world is bound by action ( ***Lokoyam karma-bandhanaḥ*** [)](# " Bhagavadgita, III, 9."). The sacrifices and religious acts, which propitiate the higher powers, spring from action ( ***yajñaḥ karmasamudbha***[***vaḥ***](# "Ibid, III 14–अनाद्भवन्ति भूतानि पर्जन्यादनसंभवः । यज्ञाद्भवति पर्जन्यो यज्ञः कर्मसमुद्भवः ।") ). Of all the terrors which living beings dread, starvation is the chief. The first impulse of a living creature is to sustain life by getting food. From hunger springs [death](# "Bṛhadaranyakopanişad, I, 2, 1- अशानाया हि मृत्युः"). But, in the divinely ordained cycle, food springs from fertilizing showers, rain is the response of the gods to sacrifices made to them. The king is the chief sacrificer. Regal neglect of the pious duty leads to starvation, and all evils

INTRODUCTION

that spring from it,-disease, disquiet and death. The impulse to action springs from Divinity ( ***karma brahmo***[***dbhava***)](# "Ibid., III 15 – कर्म ब्रह्मोद्भवं विद्धि ब्रह्माक्षरसमुद्भवम् ।"). It springs also from the good done in past lives. It is revealed in the instincts of the ruler, who models his life on the lines of Dharma. Evil of every kind, anticipated or experienced, infuses fear ( ***bhaya*** ). It is the supreme mark of the Divine Being to give all those who make pious submission to His will, an assurance that they will not experience any fear ( ***a-bhaya*** ). In iconography the attitude is represented in idols by the representa- tion of the right palm held open, with the fingers tapering upward in what is termed ***abhaya-mudrā.*** The coronation infuses divinity into the king. His first duty, after abhiseka, is to grant abhaya ( assurance of protection from fear ) to all ***living [beings](# "अभयं सर्वभूतेभ्यो संयक् तत्र दधाति च ।")***. (inf. p. 12). The fulfilment of this promise is signified immediately by the release of cattle and of a proclamation of the immunity of men and animals from molestation and death.  
(ib. p. 12).

RAKṢĀTHE COROLLARY OF A-BHAYA

  The comprehensive duty of protection is the logical corollary of the assurance that no living being in the dominions shall experience fear, except of the consequences of its own misdeeds or crimes. Protection is the first-and the last-duty of kings. It includes guarding the subjects from every conceivable harm, objective and subjective, natural and supernatural. It carries the implication of ***active*** state intervention to secure the aim. Security from invasion and from internal disorder will not cover the whole area of the duty. It is not enough for the state to keep the ring; its action must be positive as well as negative. A king is more than a crowned policeman. He must remove not only the immediate causes of fear among the people, but must strike at the root causes of social misfits and endeavour successfully to remove them. Perpetual vigilance and ceaseless activity are the prices which he must pay for his exalted position. For everything that goes wrong he alone is morally responsible. It is the function of those conversant with Rājadharma to

THE RĀJADHARMA KĀṆḌA

indicate to the king the ways and means of fulfilling his obligations.

THE KING-IN-COUNCIL .

  The constitution of a council of ministers and of an organization to carry on the administration ( ***rāṣtra-samgrahaṇam***) of the state are among the means devised to help the king in his all-round duty. It may be noted that every minister or adviser of the king is expected to be conversant with the principles of Dharma and to be imbued with zeal for conducting himself and helping others to conduct themselves in accordance with those principles. The king is brought up in a ***milieu*** favourable for his reception of Dharma. His education and training are so modelled as to give him an understanding of Dharma and a passion for it. But it is not enough to provide themental and moral endowment of the king, No one is omniscient ( ***na hi sarvaḥ sarvam jānāti***). Few, who have to take lone decisions, can be sure that they are not the results of insufficient knowledge and inexperience or of the impulse of the moment. This is the reason for insisting that a king must always consult ***ministers***. He should not deliberate alone (naiko mantrayet); nor should he take counsel with many, as then there is danger of his decisions travelling outside the frontiers of his [kingdom.](# "कच्चिन्मन्त्रयते नैकः कच्चिन्न बहुभिस्सह । कच्चित्ते मन्त्रितो मन्त्रो राष्ट्रं न परिधावति । (अयोध्याकाण्ड, १००, १८ ) ।") The elaborate precautions, which are advised when consultations are held ( inf. pp. 102-103, are obviously intended to ensure the secrecy of the decisions. In a period of weak international law and of states more are less equal in strength and resources, there is always a danger of war. If war breaks out, he who has the initiative gets a decided advantage. In the social ***milieu***, incitement to war always existed. Restriction of kingship to a caste of warriors, whose ideals comprehended the desire not to die in [bed](# " महाभारते (शान्तिप. ९७, २५) यथा-न गृहे मरणं तात क्षत्रियाणां प्रशस्यते । शौण्डीराणामशौण्डीर्य अधर्म कृपणश्च तत् ॥")and the winning of the supremacy which will enable them to perform the great sacrifices

INTRODUCTION

that great conquerors can alone perform ( ***c.g. Aśvamedha, Rajasūya etc.***), tended to produce, apart from personal bellicosity of kings, and of soldiers, a state of permanent political dis-equili-brium. But the results of an ordeal by battle are not always upto expectation. Avoid war, as victory through it is the violent (***jaghanya***) way of [conquest.](# "शान्तिपर्व, ९४, १, यथा - अयुद्धेनैव विजयं वर्द्धयेद्वसुधाधिपः । जघन्यमाहुर्विजयं युद्धेन च नराधिपः ।")The harm which wars do are recognized. The temper of the times made it impossible to confine a struggle to two kings. Others will be drawn into it by fear or by interest. The rules of humane conduct and chivalry, imposed by Dharma on the actual combatants, had no restraining influence on those who might ***start*** a war. The unpreparedness and weakness of a king may disincline him to begin a war, but if they are known to a powerful neighbour, he will begin it. Except in epochs in which large and powerful empires ruled over large areas, formed of many smaller kingships, there was always a danger of war breaking out. The means of preventing wars and of ensuring successful prosecution of wars, with external help, studied empirically, led to the formulation of principles and rules, which, formalized and classified, passed into treatises on Rajadharma and Arthaśāstra. The most valuable part of such knowledge would be secret, and those who possessed it in a high degree would be chosen as royal advisers. The unstable political conditions are reflected in the increasing importance of the minister who advised the king on peace and war (***sāndhivigrahika***). A nice balance of power is indicated when a prime-minister has to take charge of the ministry of foreign affairs.

UPĀYA, ŚĀḌGUṆYA AND RĀJAMAṆḌALA

  The theory of foreign relations of states is concentrated into three topics, which, in accordance with Indian custom, are again crystallized into a specific number for each. Ways and means are indicated by the ***upāyas*** ( policies )and the 'expedients'The former are four : appeasement or conciliation ( ***sāma*** ), subsidising or gifts ( ***dāna*** ), sowing discord ( ***bheda*** ) and punishment or war ( ***daṇḍa*** ). This is the enumeration of Dharma-

THE RAJADHARMA KĀṆḌA

sāstra. Well applied, says Yājñavalkya ( I, 346 ), they are helpful, and the last, Daṇḍa is to used only if all the other three fail, War is to be the last resort. The ***Mitākṣarā*** points out that the four expedients are not merely political but are of general applicability in [life](# " एते सामादयो न केवलं राज्यव्यवहारविषयाः अपि तु सर्वलोकव्यवहारविषयाः । (१, ३४६ )").Manu ( VII, 109 ) gives the quartette only a political application, and declares that the wise ( ***panditāḥ*** ) regard the first and fourth expedients alone as praiseworthy ( ***praśamsanti*** ). The efforts for conciliation must be sincere ( [***tathyam sāma ca kartavyam***](# "महाकुलीना ऋजवो धर्मनित्या जितेन्द्रियाः। सामसाध्याः न चातथ्यं तेषु साम प्रयोजयेत् । तथ्यं साम च कर्तव्यम् । ( मत्स्यपुराण, वी. मि., पृ. २७९ ) ।") ). The Puâṇas, following Nīti- s'āstra, add three more ***upāyas***, viz, ***upekṣā*** ( ignoring ), māya (deceit ) and ***indrajāla*** ( terrorization ). The three practices are omitted by Lakṣmīdhara, who follows the higher ethics of sastra, condemning the use of deception and unfair methods. Mitramisra takes Daṇḍa to be two-fold and distinguishes between the application of force within and without the kingdom. This misconception of the real sense of Danda makes him go off at a tangent and bring in a resume of criminal law under the fourth ***upāya***

  The concept of the six ***guņas*** is also ancient. It is referred to in the kaccit chapter ( ch. 100 ) of the ***Ayodhyākāṇḍa***, in S'ri Rāma's interrogation of Bharata (sl. 69-70 ). Manu has a long passage, which Lakṣmīdhara has cited in full without comment. The six are-sandhi ( agreement for mutual co-operation in war ), vigraha ( hostility ), yāna ( marching troops against the enemy ), āsana ( armed and ready to intervenc ), ***dvaidhībhāva*** (explained later on by Manu as division of one's army into two) and āsraya ( subordinate alliance with a powerful ruler for help against an enemy ). As virtually all neighbours are regarded as potential enemies, if the frontiers of their kingdoms march with one's own, diplomatic activity must be constant to prevent an enemy stealing an advantage. In explaining them, Medhātithi would make them subserve internal development even more than furnish safeguards against foreign aggression." These are, he [says](# "Jha's trn., III, 371.")the six measures of policy; "and from among these, he shall

INTRODUCTION

have recourse to that one by means of which he feels that he would be enabled to erect fortifications, capture elephants, dig mines, carry on trade, cut down forests, raise embankments around fields in tracts not irrigated by rain, win the wealth of other people, and so forth." If this is the purport of the 'six means,' it has travelled very far from the aims stated by Kauṭilya. That the six were meant to cover all conceivable means of securing state ends, and that they were so interpreted, from time to time and from occasion to occasion, as to make this comprehensiveness possible, may be deduced from the above explanation as well as from the very different interpretations of the terms themselves. Thus, for ***dvaidhībħāva***, Manu himself supplies an illustration, viz., division of forces into two, one apparently marching against the enemy while the other remains behind to prevent a rear attack by the neighbour on the other side, who is also a potential foe. But, ***Medhātithi*** ( VII, 160 ) interprets the term as putting forward at one and the same time terms of peace and war i.e., an ultimatum ( VII, 167 ). He gives an alternative explanation of ***dvaidhībhāva***, in that sloka itself: ***dvaidhābhāva*** is resorted to by way of favouring divisions of the army, so as to give all divisions of the army equal opportunities of securing booty.

  Kāmandaka ( XI, 24-27 ) takes the term to mean double- dealing, and even double-crossing. Carrying on secret negotiations for peace with two foes simultaneously without an intention of keeping the pledge, joining one of the two foes against the other, or, if found out by both enemies, allying himself with a third power against both are his illustrations of ***dvaidhībhāva***. Carrying on negotiations for settlement, while arranging for a sudden attack, as Japan did before the attack on Pearl Harbour, will come within this category. It is evident that the original sense of this and other terms had long passed out of recollection, and that their citation in Rājadharma from Manu, without comment, might give the opportunity for interpreting them as suited to circumstances, and cloaking them under Dharma sanction. Whatever is stated in Manu and is intelligible without comment is to be taken as mandatory. The injunction to weigh one's strength against the foe's, from accurate information gained from his intelligence department, is sensible advice to a king. So is

THE RĀJADHARMA KĀṆḌA

the exhortation to persist in a course onee decided on, in spite of disappointments and set-backs ( inf. p. 114 ).

  The Rājamaṇḍala ( circle of kings ) is a third ancient concept, which is to be found in the epics and in the most ancient works on Arthasāstra. It was developed by discussion and several views of its component number are recorded by Kāmandaku ( VIII, 16-52 ). Among writers on polity, whose writings are now lost, Maya stood for a mandala of four kings, besides the ***vijigīṣu*** ( the king who wishes to embark on conquest ), Puloma for one of six, Usanas for one of twelve, Brhaspati for one of eighteen, Visālākṣa for one of fifty-four, and lastly Parãsara, for a group composed only the two foes and no others. The followers of Manu are said to stand for a circle of twelve kings, and as each king has five ***prakṛtis***, each of whom must count, ***viz., durga, rāṣtra, kosa, mantrī*** and bala, there are sixty ***prakṛtis*** and twelve kings, making seventy-two in all. This is the maṇḍala which Lakṣmīdhara has [accepted](# " As also Kāmandaką,"). The basic ideas of the theory are five. ( 1 ) Common frontiers cause constant friction and outbreak of hostilities, making immediate neighbours natural enemies. ( 2 ) Common enmity unites against a king his neighbours on opposite sides. ( 3 ) One whose boundaries march with those of two opposed kings, is forced into a neutral position (***madhyama***), as his interests are divergent from those of both combatants. ( 4 ) It is unwise for a king to advance against an enemy without taking care of his rear, for the protection of which he must leave behind adequate forces, unless he can embroil the neighbour immediately behind him (***pāṛṣṇigrāha***) with the king further on ( ***ākranda*** ). ( 5 ) It is rarely possible to secure alliances, other than natural, by treaties which will be observed. The emphasis on the ***prakṛtis*** implies that the weakness or disloyalty of any one ***prakṛti*** will cause harm to a belligerent and bring a corresponding gain to his enemy. The elaborate rules for the selection of ***prakṛtis*** and the devices for constantly watching their conduct suggest that attempts will be made to tamper with their loyalty, either before or after the commencement of hostilities. The prescription of individual consultation with the ***prakṛtis***, in place of cabinet discussions, and the repeated injunctions to the king to keep his own counsel till his actions show what he would

INTRODUCTION

be at, point to this possibility also. The smrtis contain warnings against ministers who may succumb to the enemy's blandishments, if they are dishonoured by their own master, and they prescribe measures to test fidelity ( ***anurāgapārā***[***gau*** ).](# " inf. p. 154.") Even those who stand nearest a king, such as the Queen, the Yuvarāja, the princes of the blood, the commander-in-chief, and the ministers, burning with suppressed anger, against the king, may prove amenable to the enemy's approaches. But, a king will be ill-advised if he tries to set some of his own men against others, as he will then be ruined even without an enemy to assail [him.](# "inf. p. 128.")The policy of "divide and rule" is rejected in Indian polity as fatal to the king who practises it in his own dominions. This is why both Manu and Yajñavalkya advise a king, who wishes to prosper, to act without guile in dealing with his relations and friends ***(*** ***snigdheṣu ajiḥmī, suḥṛtsu ajiḥmaḥ, p. 21 inf.)*** The "friend" is defined by Medhātithi in this context as a zealous and loyal servant or minister. Duplicity will not beget loyalty.

INDIAN THEORY OF THE STATE

  Lakṣmīdhara's treatise, like all post-Manu writings, regards monarchy as not only the normal form of government, but as almost the only approved form. The king is at the head of the state. The definition of his powers and privileges indicates what the state is competent to do and not to do. The king is the state and the state is the king. Not only all executive authority, but all executive responsibility, is concentrated in the king. Kingship is a necessary, but not a natural institution. The deterioration of the moral nature of man made a controlling authority necessary to prevent the strong devouring the weak. Dharma furnishes the pre-ordained means of overcoming the downward pull in human action. Organization in ***varṇa*** and ***āsrama***, and in varied functions, for each of which there is its peculiar moral norm (***guṇa-dharma***), arrests human degradation and helps man to overcome the disposition to evil-doing. It is the function of the king, i.e. the state, to maintain the norms, in order that society may not dissolve and that the individuals who compose

THE RĀJADHARMA KANDA

it may succeed in the aims of life ( ***puruṣārtha*** ). He discharges the function by the exercise of power ( ***daṇḍa*** ) to which every one submits, so long as it is exercised in accordance with Dharma. Every one is under Dharma, including the king and the state. No human being is competent to change the norms set by divine authority. The definition of human activity in accordance with them is the task of Dharmsastra. To see that conduct conforms to Dharma is the duty of the king, i.e., the state. Dharma is eternal. It is also immutable and cannot be modified by human agency or even by the gods. It is the sun of a moral universe.

  *Vis-a-vis* Dharma the king ( or the state ) is only a subordinate. Dharma is king over kings. The power to make laws, which will modify or repeal Dharma, is not vasted in any human authority. The king's edicts ( rājas'āsanam ) may elucidate what is ordained by Dharma, it may supplement it in ways that harmonize with its letter and spirit, but it cannot change it even to the smallest [extent](# "Rajadharma, pp. 132-137 for a discussion of the topic and references."). Whatever is specifically enjoined by Dharma is beyond human power to alter. The legislative capacity of the state is restricted to making rules, not laws, i.e. to sub-ordinate legislation, such as executives are now armed with, for social convenience. To miss any duty, however small, which is enjoined is dereliction, whosocver be the person committing the default. The outlines of Dharma are inflexible. The deter- mination of the extent to which there is freedom to act, within the lines laid by Dharma, is the task of jurisprudents and ***siṣṭhas***. In this sense the constitution of every ancient Indian state was ***rigid***.

  But within the limits laid down, there is scope for much individual freedom of action. A person may not change his ***varṇa***, but change of occupation was permissible in special circumstances. Inquisition into private activity was restricted  
to watching social conformity to norms, and police needs. He who fulfilled the duties of his station in life was free. Frontiers of states were not closed. The ascetic, the student, the trader and the pilgrim moved freely from one jurisdiction to another. Large movements of population, necessitated by famine, or op- pression, were possible, and some are known to history. One

INTRODUCTION

method of escaping tyranny that is suggested in the epics is getting beyond the territorial jurisdiction of the power that oppresses. The " freedom " struck foreign observers like Fa Hien ( c A.D. [400 )](# "Travels, trn., Giles, ch. XVI: ").

  The state was only one of many devices for maintaining the balance of the Universe. The king is not the sole upholder of the community. Spiritual authority has to co-operate with the secular. "The king and the Brahman uphold the universe." Society needs economic props; otherwise it crumbles. The Vaisya and the Śūdra are no less necessary for social stability than the Brāhmaṇa and Kṣatriya. This is symbolized in the rites of coronation. The ***varṇas*** are not successive layers, one super-imposed on another, but co-ordinate. In Dharma there is social classification by birth and function, but no stratification. Similarly, the state functions side by side with non-political groups based on kinship, common enterprise, occupation, voluntary organization and propinquity."

  The special customs or rules of such organizations have to be allowed and enforced by the [state.](# " Ancient Indian Polity, pp. 46, 63 and 99. Gautama, XI, 22; Ãpastamba, II, 154; Baudhāyana, I, 2-12 ; Vasiṣṭha, I, 17; and Manu, VII, 11, 18, VII, 203, and VIII, 41. 42, 46.") Even in the domain of personal law, in which the aim is obviously uniformity, the recognition of family custom (e.g. cousin marriage) is [enjoined.](# " See the discussion in P. V. Kane's Vyavahāramayukha (1926), pp.199-204.")

  Civil government being imposed on a society, whose constitution rests on sanctions which are transcendental, has to recognize the claims of spirituality side by side with political and economic activity. Scales of values are different from present day scales. Honour and deference are prized more than affluence, and status is determined by service. The basic assumptions of existence, among which the concept of this life being only a hyphen connecting two eternities is the chief, make it difficult to differentiate between "secular" and "spiritual." They give the acts of the state, as of individuals, an extension beyond one life. The taint of crime is removable by penance and by civil punishment. Rites of propitiation and expiation are brought within the obligatory duties of the state, in consequence

THE RĀJADHARMA KĀṆḌA

of these hypotheses. The stress laid on them is an index of the belief in their efficacy. The space devoted in the ***Rájadharmakāṇda*** to non-secular acts, which offends a modern sense of proportion, would have appeared to those to whom it was addressed, as only proper. They would have seen lopsidedness only if such topics were dealt with perfunctorily, or were omitted altogether.

  In theory, therefore, there was a sense in which the king was sovereign and absolute, and another sense in which he was not. Supreme legislative power, which is now regarded as the mark of sovereignty, the old Indian king did not have. A ruler who attempted to exercise such a power would have provoked more opposition than Akhnaton or Julian, when they ran counter to contemporary opinion and belief. But, in administering the kingdom in accordance with Dharma, there was no constituted authority which could challenge the king's action. As power went with responsibility, the sole responsibility of the ruler made for his independence of any rival authority. In that sense, the ancient Indian king was in theory absolute. It would have been also the political practice, if the checks provided by society had no power to restrain a self-willed king. But, such power largely accrued to society, which left it open to a ruler to defy Dharma only at his peril. Rājadharma cites instances of rulers, who were removed for tyranny, and Nītiśāstra is even more explicit. If the idea of his divine right went to an autocrat's head, it was corrected by the theory of the divinity innate also in the subject (prajā-[Viṣṇu )](# "Candes'vara's Rajanïtiratnä., p. 74 अद्यारम्भ न मे राज्यं राज्यं रक्षतु प्रजाः इति प्रजाविष्णुं साक्षिणं श्रावयेन्मुहुः ।"). Transgression of duty may be visited by condign punishment of the realm, imposed by supernatural powers, which in turn will stir up the people against the ruler. In any case, vicissitudes will be more readily attributed to an crring king, who is unpopular, than to a popular ruler.

  In practice, one will look for the checks provided against misuse of regal power in the institutions existing in society. How far could they resist absolutism?

  To take the first ***varṇa*** first : the Brāhmaṇas formed only a minute part of the population. They were unarmed. By

INTRODUCTION

inclination and training they could not oppose force to force.Unlike the priesthood in mediacval Europe they were not organized under a common head, did not form a guild, and were not habituated to collective action. Unlike the Church, in Europe, they had no financial backing. Individually and collectively they were poor. Their income was irregular, and did not come from tithes, or payments made regularly to temple priests. Their educational work was done without salary. They were dependant on the patronage of the king himself. They could not intermarry into the royal family and create an aristocracy which could challenge the king. They could not replace the king by one of themselves. Their habituation to non-economic motives would ordinarily deprive them of the ambition to grasp [power](# " Puşyamitra, though a Brāhmaņa, was also the first soldier in the kingdom."). They had no more power than the king to make laws or to alter them. But their learning and austere lives will lend their criticisms of regal action much force, while a fasting unto death undertaken by even a single high-minded Brahmana will create a grave situation for the king. It is to this form of protest, known as ***prayopavesa*** that Brāhmaṇas resorted at last when oppression became unbearablc. Kalhana, who was a contemporary of Lakşmīdhara, describes the application of this form of social pressure in Kaşmir, and its effectiveness, till it degenerated into a device of habitual revolutionaries. Even then, its popular appeal was so great that special officials were appointed in Kāşmīr to watch those who threatened to fast as a[protest.](# " Rajatarangini was completed in 1149 A.D. See Canto VII, passim for instances, and Canto VIII, 428 and 658.")

  The Kṣatriyas were also numerically a small section of the population. They formed the back-bone of the army. The king is warned that a realm in which a ***kṣtriya*** starves soon faces ruin. They bore arms. Their relations to the ruler were how- ever not feudal. The bulk of them were poor. The potentialities of trouble to an unpopular king were greater from this ***varṇa*** than from others.

  Not only the king, but the whole community depended on the Vaisya and Śūdra. Most of the taxes came from the Vaisyas. They were the persons who stood to suffer most from insecurity

THE RAJADIHARMA KAṆḌA

and invasion of personal and property rights. As Āryas the Vaisyas could not be enslaved, even in war. They were well organized, as were craftsmen also, in guilds, and were disciplined for common, concerted action. Each guild, and the community in cach city, had its accredited leaders. Their opposition, or non-cooperation will paralyse even an unbelieving king, whereas the non-cooperation of the Brahmana, who refuses to help him to placate the gods, will hardly move a ruler who is a sceptic.

    The ministers had no constitutional right to implement their advice, against a king, who will not accept it. But, the risk that the king will run from a disgruntled council, is indicated in the weightage given to ministers in the *Rājamaṇḍala*, in which, in Manu's classification they occupy sixty out of the seventy-two ***prakṛti-sthānas*. **

  An effective brake on the king existed in his own slender resources. His prerogative rights were few and poor. Even the right of the king to treasure-trove was limited to a portion, if the finder was not a Brāhmana. Rights to escheated property were also similarly circumscribed. A king may accept ceremonial presents, but not gifts coming under dāna. The description of Manu that "the king is lord of all" is complimentary exaggeration. His right to all the land in the kingdom is denied by ***[Mimāmsa.](# " Sabara-bhasya, VI, 7, 3; Colebrooke's Miscellaneous Essays (1871), I, pp. 320-321, Ancient Indian Economic Thought, pp. 179-181.")*** He is entitled only to one-sixth of the produce from land, and to certain other fixed ratios of income and to customs, excise and state monopolics. Agriculture and trade languish under misgovernment, and if they dry up the main sources of the king's income go. As against this, his commitments in expenditure are many and heavy. If he attempts to increase his income by such fiscal exactions as those that Śankaravarman of Kāsmīr practised (of which Kalhana gives a vivid [description)](# " Rajatarangini, V, 165-181.")the resulting popular discontent will encourage a neighbour to invade his territory. An empty treasury, a sullen army, an angry priesthood and an enraged people form a combination which will spell ruin to a kingdom, in which these prevail, even on the first impact of invasion. The fear of such intervention must have been more effective in restraining the vagaries of an autocrat than

INTRODUCTION

any constitutional machinery, empowered to call his actions into question.

  But, the best of all checks is to bring up a king in a manner that will make it unlikely that he will prove blind to the dictates of Dharma and to the promptings of self-interest, which is best safeguarded by scrupulous attention to the beliefs even more than to the real interests of the people. The traditions of conciliar government and of careful recruitment of the ministry and the official hierarchy will effect a great deal, especially when the king is habituated to such methods of administration. But even more effective will be his education in all branches of Dharma, viewed comprehensively as Rājadharma, and the provision of a digest in which Dharma will be expounded in a manner which will make it clear to the people no less than to the ruler, and in which emphasis will be laid just on those features which a king should not miss if he should rise to the level of the ideal ruler, whose every act will reflect the inspiration of the divinity immanent in kingship. This is the task which has been essayed by Lakṣmīdhara.
