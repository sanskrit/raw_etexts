THE POEM AND THE AUTHOR.

 The little volume now offered to the public contains two of the three S'atakas of Bhartṛhari, one of the celebrated poets of ancient India. Of the History of the poem or of its author very little is known that is authentic. The only circumstances in the life of Bhartrhari that we know have been handed down by traditions and the various accounts that these give can hardly be reconciled. Bhartrhari is traditionally represented as belonging to the Royal house of Ujjain; and though he was entitled to the crown, he is said to have abdicated it in favour of his younger brother Vikrama, the founder of the Samvat Era, as he was disgusted with wordly life on account of the discovery of his wife's infidelity and retired to the forest wishing to lead an ascetic's life. Be that as it may. One fact appears to be incontrovertibly true from the general tenor of the Satakas that Bhartrhari must have met with sore disappointment in life, and his faith in the virtue of women was perhaps shaken by certain bitter experiences in his own life or of those he had around. We give below the different accounts of him as found in different works. (1) In one Ms. the name of Bhartrhari's wife, mentioned in connection with the above tradition, is given as Anangasenâ. (2) The ***Arváchînakosha*** mentions Virasens, a Gandharva, as the father of Bhartrhari. Four children were born, viz. Bhar., Vikramaditya, Subhatavirya and Mainâvatî (the mother of the well-known Gopichanda). (3) Bhartrhari's mother was Sus'ili, the only daughter of the king of Jambudvipa. This king had no son and so he gave the

\*This tradition seems to have given rise to Niti S'ataka al. 2 which has hardly any connection in the place where it stands, and may possibly be an interpolation.

 kingdom to Bhartrhari who transferred the seat of government to Ujjain, placed Vikramaditya on the throne and appointed Subhatavírya his commander-in-chief (4) The name of Bh.'s wife was Padmâkshi and she was the daughter of Simhasena, king of Magadha. (5) Mr. Sheshagiri Shastri gives a rather curious tradition. He says:—"King Vikramaditya is said to have been the son of a Brahmana named Chandragupta who married four wives, one of the Brâhmana caste, another of the Kshatriya, the third of Vais'ya, the fourth of the S'údra caste. They were called Brahmani, Bhanumatí, Bhagyavati and Sindhumati. Each of the four bore him a son. Vara- ruchi was born of the first wife, Vikramárka of the Second,. Bhatti of the third, and Bhartrhari of the fourth. Vikramarka. became king, and Bhatti served him in the capacity of Prime Minister."

 It need not said how far such traditions are capable of furnishing us materials for a trustworthy account of the poet.All that can be gathered from the above-mentioned traditions is that our post was of royal descent and that, being disgusted with the world, he renounced it, and retired to the forest as an anchorite and further that he was a man of poetic talents, & great scholar and a Yogi. Besides the S'atakas another work called the Vákyapadiya goes by the name of Bhartrhari. The poet Bhatti, author of the Bhatti Kavya, is also by tradition identified with Bhartrhari.\*

**THE AUTHORSHIP OF THE S'ATAKAS.**

 Bhartrhari is, by a general consensues of opinion, regarded as the author of the three S'atakas. To a superficial reader they appear to be a collection of verses without any collecting link. And this circumstance, viz., that the verses have no common bond of unity, has given rise to a theory that the S'atakas are not an original work but a mere compilation from the works of former authors. An additional circumstance, that some of the

———————————————————————————————————————————————————

 verses in these *S'atakas* are found in works by other authors. which are not mere compilations, has lent colouring to this assumption. Another theory is that the author of the *S\`atakas*****was not Bhartrhari but that some poet composed them in his name. This theory has neither a wide currency nor has it any stronghold on the minds of scholars. With regard to the former it is sufficient to remember that only a small number of the verses in the *S'atakas* have been attributed to other writers, that these in almost all cases are persons of less note and that they cannot be said to have preceded Bhartṛhari in chronological order. The number of verses which can at all be challenged as not being Bhartrhari's will not exceed fifty in the two *S'atakas*; and even of this number very few can be definitely ascribed to one writer or another. With the exception of Kalidasa with whom Bhartrhari has one verse incommon (sl. 70 *Niti S'ataka*) all others from whom Bhartrhari can be suspected of having borrowed" are persons less noted than he, and removed by several centuries from the period at which we think our post can be placed. The S'atakas, therefore, must be regarded as an original work. Had they been a mere compilation Bh, would have designated his col- lection by some such name as Subhashita-manjúshá or the like. Besides the verses are not altogether isolated. There are connecting links which divide them into different groups. To a careful reader they will appear to be the outpourings of a mind strongly disgusted with the world or powerfully affected by its incidents; and the poet must have penned his thoughts down as his mind was held in sway by different emotions at different times. We must, however, believe that the nature of work and its very want of a common thread as in a continuons narrative afforded facilities to unscrupulous persons to pass off either their own or other verses as Bhartyhari's, and that numerous interpolations must have, from time to time, be made, since the number of verses in each *S'ataka*****has considerably increased, so much that the three *S'atakas*



 now contain nearly 400 [verses](#%C2%A0%20%C2%A0It%20cannot%20be%20said%20whether%20it%20was%20with%20regard%20to%20this%20circumstance%20that%20Colebrooke%20spoke%20of%20the%20S'atakas%20as%20'either%20three%20or%20four%C2%A0S'atakas%20or%20centuries%20of%20couplets. " It cannot be said whether it was with regard to this circumstance that Colebrooke spoke of the S'atakas as 'either three or fourS'atakas or centuries of couplets.") between them. The growth, however, has been so much mixed with the original that it has now become an almost hopeless task to resort to the process of [elimination.](#%20An%20attempt%20(though%20not%20final)%20has%20been%20made%20in%20this%20edition%20to%20detach%20such%20verses%20from%20the%20original.)

THE DATE OF THE S'ATAKAS.

 The poet himself furnishes no evidence as to his date, nor does he give any information about himself in his work. We must, therefore, judge at what period in Sanskrit literature we are to place the poet, first, from tradition, and secondly from internal and external evidence, Tradition makes Bhartrhari, as has already been said, the brother of Vikramaditya, the epoch-maker. And antiquarians do not seem to be opposed to this view. Vikrama's era, the Samvat, begins 56 years before Christ.

We shall show further on, from evidence collected by Mr. K. B. Pathak, and which seems to be very conclusive, that the author of the Vakyapadiya was a Buddhist.

This followed the Upanishad period and was coeval with the Pauranic and Buddhistic periods. The greatest names of the Vedantie period are those of Kumarila Bhatta, and the still more famous Shankaracharya. Kumarila is supposed to have flourished about 700 A. D., and Shankaracharya half a century later (though there are grounds to believe that the flourished long before this). The Vedantic age thus extended beyond the eighth century but its beginning cannot be traced with any degree of accuracy.")

 The internal evidence as to the date of the *S'atakas* is of very vague and uncertain nature. The S'atakas are interspersed with Vedântic phraseology, but this in itself is hardly sufficient to determine their period. The doctrines of the Vedantins were being discussed and formed for a number of centuries, and it is therefore difficult to hazard a conjecture as to a particular period in the history of Sanskrit letters having produced the poems. The Puranas are also referred to in the work; and as Prof. Wilson has tried to show that none of the Puranas date back more than a thousand years, some scholars have tried to place the *Satakas* at so laté a period as the eleventh or twelfth [century](#The%20Paurapic%C2%A0age%20is%20also%20the%20subject%20of%20as%20much%20controversy%20any%20other%20period%20in%20Sanskrit%20literature.%20The%20greatest%20name%20connected%20with%20this%20period%20is%20that%20of%20Vyåss,%20the%20outhor%20of%20the%20eighteen%20Puranas%20Vyisa's%20name%20is%20also%20connected%20with%20the%20Vedic%20period;%20for%20he%20is%20said%20to%20have%20arranged%20the%20Vedas%20as%20we%20now%20find%20them.%20Vylsa%20may%20therefore%20be%20regarded%20as%20the%20link%20between%20the%20Vedio%20and%20the%20Paorápic%20periods,%20and%20to%20have%20lived%20towards%20the%20close%20of%20the%20Vedio%20age%20and%20marked%20the%20commencement%20of%20the%20Pauranio%20age.%20He%20is%20therefore%20certainly%20a%20good%20deal%20older%20than%20the%20Obrietian%20Era, "The Paurapicage is also the subject of as much controversy any other period in Sanskrit literature.

 doubted whether the reasoning of Prof. Wilson is conclusive. enough; and whatever view might be held as to the interpolations which have been made in some of the Purâņas, yet in general it may be said that they or some of them at least have existed prior to the first century A. D. so that the mere mention of the Purânas in a work cannot prove any thing as to its being a modern production,

 Let us now see if *external evidence* will assist us in establishing the date of Bhartrhari. His commentators, it seems, never troubled themselves with this question, They like others before and after them appear to have followed the maxim,"gold is gold, why enquire how old it is?" Nor is there any specific mention of the author of the *S'atakas* in any of the old writers which will throw any the least light on his age.  
 There is, however, one passage in a Persian work, the *Kali-la-u-Dimnah* which bears a close resemblance to one occurring in the *Pancha Tantra,* where again it is borrowed from Bhartṛ- hari. The Persian work was a translation of the *Pancha Tantra*not directly from the original Sanskrit and was written for one of the kings of Persia between 531 and 579 A. D. The*Pancha Tantra,* must, therefore, be an older work, in existence in the year 500 A. D. at the latest. The *Pancha Tantra* is not in all its parts an original work, but draws largely upon the literature then existing Among other works it is indebted to the *S'atakas,* and one stanza from the *Niti S'ataka* has been borrowed by the [Pancha Tantra](#%20%C2%A0%20Niti%20S'ataka,%20SL,%2094.%20Sharangadhara,%20however,%20quotes%20this%20verse%2088%20of%20some%20other%20poet%20after%20quoting%20a%20number%20from%20Bhartrhari. "  Niti S'ataka, SL, 94. Sharangadhara, however, quotes this verse 88 of some other poet after quoting a number from Bhartrhari.") and from thence by the*Kalila-u-Dimnah.* The author of the S'ata kas therefore must have lived some time before 500 A. D. that is we cannot place him later than the latter half of the fifth century.  
 Bhartphari nowhere mentions contemporary persons or incidents nor is he referred to by any writer as a contemporary



 Thus it will be seen that there is nothing that goes against the date furnished by the tradition.

THE [IDENTITY](#This%20is%20taken%20here%20with%20minor%20changes,%20which%20do%20not%20affect%20the%20argument%20at%20all,%20from%20my%20Introduction%20to%20the%20Bhatti%20Kavya%20Cantos%20I-V. "This is taken here with minor changes, which do not affect the argument at all, from my Introduction to the Bhatti Kavya Cantos I-V.") OF BHARTṚHARI AND BHATTI.

 Bhartrhari has been identified with Bhatti, the author of the celebrated *Bhatti Kavya.* As regards Bhartṛhari himself there is a controversy as to whether the Bhartrhari of the *S'atakas* and his namesake, author of the *Vâkyapadiya,* are one and the same. So the controversy expends itself thus—Was Bhatti another name for the author of the *S'atakas,* or for the auhtor of the *Vâkyapadîya,* or were the three one and the eame or quite different individuals? That the three were no-one is conclusively proved from some evidence collected together by Prof. K. B. Pathak. Mr. Páthak has proved from contemporary and other unquestionable evidence that the author of the *Vakyapadîya* was a Buddhist. Neither Bhartṛhari, the author of the *S'atakas,* nor Bhatti, was a Buddhist. The *S'atakas* are not only not imbued with any of the characteristicthat ought to mark a Buddhistic work for the inculcation of moral principles (for which the *S'atakas* are intended), but even the alleged traces of Buddhism in them are so faint that one can confidently assert that the work is not the production of Buddhistie genius. Nor was Bhatti a follower of Buddha. He'glorifies in his epio, the *Bhatti kavya,* a hero whom Hinduism has idolised. A Buddhist would have chosen for his hero a co-religionist rather than a Hindu divinity. So the author of the *Vákyapadiya* was a distinet individual from either of the authors of the *Satakas* or the *Bhattikavya*, So the question to be determined now is— was Bhatti the same as the author of the *S'atakas*? And we think not. In the accounts of the lives of these two individuals there is too great difference to admit of the one being identified with the other. If we ignore the tradition that the two were one



 and the same individual, we find very little that is common to the life of the two. Bhartrhari was a *Kshatriya,* Bhaṭṭi a*Brahmana;* the former is connected with Central India and the latter seems from a passage in the *Bhatti Kavya* to have belonged to the court of Valabhi. From internal evidence offered by the *S'atakas* and the *Bhatti Kavya* we might say that they could not have been the productions of the same pen. The latter is, as is well known, a grammatical poet and the author shows a wonderful command in handling his words, and even from a grammatical point of view the poem can be said to be a perfect piece of composition. Of the *S'atakas* we cannot say the same. They confront us here and there with an uncouth form of word, and a clumsy [construction](#%20For%20instances%20Boe.%20100%20N.%20S.%206%20F.%208.%20Mis.%20&c. " For instances Boe. 100 N. S. 6 F. 8. Mis. &c.").This in itself is sufficient to awaken our suspicion, and reject all theories of identity. In their religion too they seem to be two different persons. Bhartrhari, though a professed unitarian as regards. Siva and Vishnu, now and then betrays his predilections towards the former [deity](#See%20SL.%20&c.%20F.%20S.%2069,%2065,%2085,%20&c. "See SL. &c. F. S. 69, 65, 85, &c."),while Bhatti is a devout worshipper of the latter. Another circumstance which leads to the same conclusion, is, as remarked by Mr. Govind Sankara S'astri Bápat (in his preface to his edition of the Bhatti Kávya, N. S. Press Series), that in ancient works, distinction is made of the quotations from the works of these two poets. In the absence of equally trustworthy evidence or convincing argument, the above circumstances are sufficient to dispel all ideas of the identity of these two poets.

*THE TWO BHARTRHARIS.*

 Colebrooke seems to have made a distinction between the two Bhartrharis; for when speaking of *Bhattikávya* he says that its author was Bhartrhari and cautions his readers at the same time that this Bhartrhari was not the brother of Vikrama and author of the *S'atakas.* Evidently he must have been referring to the author of the Fályapadiya whom he identifies



 with Bhatti. We have already stated on Mr. Páthak's authority that the author of the *Vakyapadiya* was a Buddhist; and now we shall proceed to summarise Mr. Páthak's evidence in brief.

 The Chinese traveller I–tsing who paid a visit to India towards the close of the 7th century states that the *grammarian*Bhartrhari died forty years before his visit. The author of of the *Vákyapadiya*, the Chinese pilgrim says, was a Buddhist who "believed deeply in the three jewels, and meditated on the two-fold voidness." Vâchaspatimiśra, a writer of the 11th century speaks of the author of the *Vakyapadîya,* as a*Báshya,*which means *Vedabá*

h

*ya,* and this word was applied to the Buddhists. This confirms the statement of I-tsing that the grammarian Bhartṛhari was a Buddhist. Kumárila indulges in a violent invective against the author of the*Vályapadîya,* which it would be difficult to understand under any other supposition than that he was a Buddhist. So the authors of the *S'atakas* and the *Vákyapadiya* must beregarded as different persons, and the only objection which Mr. Telang had to placing our poet so early as at the middle of the 1st century B. O. may be supposed to be laid at rest.

THE S'ATAKAS.

 As already remarked the Satakas are an original work. They are three in number, vis. Sringára, Niti and Vairigys, They must have been composed by the poet after he had renounced the world. Probably the Niti Sataka was written first, then followed the Śringára and lastly the Vairágya Śataka- We shall speak of the 1st and Srd later on. Here we shall say something about the 2nd. The Sri. Sa, which deals with erotic sentiment has naturally to do with women and the feelings and sentiments to which their youthful charms give rise"Here Bhartrhari," says Prof. Macdonell, in graceful and meditative verse, shows himself to be well acquainted with the charms of women and with the arts by which they

 captivate the hearts of men." In it the poet describes how men, how-so-ever strong-minded or learned they may be, fall victims to the shafts of Cupid or are caught into the snares of their wiles or amorous sports by women. The Śri. Sa., however, is written by the post with a view to create disgust for sensual pleasures in the hearts of men and as preparatory to the teachings of the Vairágya S'ataka,

VEDANTIC OR BUDDHISTIC.

 The Satakas are said by some to be Buddhistic. There might be some faint traces of Buddhist [terminology](#The%20suspicion%20that%20our%20poet%20was%20a%20Buddhist%20rests%20on%20the%20authority%20of%20a%20Chinese%20traveller,%20but%20he%20refers%20to%20the%20author%20of%20the%20Vakyapadiya%C2%A0and%20not%20to%20our%20poet.%20See%20Supra.%20The%20Buddhistic%20traces%20are%20very%20faint%20and%20can%20hardly%20be%20detected.%20See%20हिसाशुन्य%C2%A0S'l.%2098.%20V.%20S'.,%20स्वानुभूति%C2%A0N.%20S'.%201%20&c "The suspicion that our poet was a Buddhist rests on the authority of a Chinese traveller, but he refers to the author of the Vakyapadiyaand not to our poet.

On the contrary the extreme paucity of such passages as bear, in whatsover degree, indications of Buddhism, and the large preponderance of passages referring to the Yoga and the Vedánta philosophies ought to be considered as sufficient evidence to maintain that the Satakas are not Buddhistic but [Vedantic](#There%20is%20frequent%20reference%20to%20Vedântic%20doctrines%20and%20to%20their%20source,%20the%20Vedas,%20in%20the%20S'atakas;%20for%20the%20latter%20see%20N.%20S.%20Sl.%20a%2063,%2065,%2071,%20&c.%20and%20for%20the%20former%20V.%20S.%20कर्म%20निर्भुलयन्ति%C2%A0%20100,%20कर्मनिर्मूलक्षणः%2090,%20ब्रह्म%2070,%2071,%20Mis.%209%20परे%20ब्रम्हणि%20101%20&;%20निर्विकल्पे%C2%A0साधौ%C2%A0&c. "There is frequent reference to Vedântic doctrines and to their source, the Vedas, in the S'atakas; for the latter see N. S. Sl. a 63, 65, 71, &c. and for the former V. S. कर्म निर्भुलयन्ति 100, कर्मनिर्मूलक्षणः 90, ब्रह्म 70, 71, Mis. 9 परे ब्रम्हणि 101 &; निर्विकल्पेसाधौ&c."). On this point Mr. Telang declares that after reading and rereading the Satakas he failed to trace any thing in them which can be called peculiarly Buddhistic. And it is certainly absurd to expect that Buddhism, with all the wide influence it once commanded in India, would fail to leave its mark, faint though it be, on any thing connected with philosophy and morals.

THEIR FATALISTIO TENDENCY.

 Some might be led to think that Satakas inculcate, at least countenance, fatalism. In a land where the doctrine of



 transmigration prevailed from the earliest times it was but natural that the conception of fate should have exerted its influence on moral poetry. And there is no wonder that Bhartrhari's mind, like all Indian minds, leaned toward fatalism. But his fatalism, like that of other writers, is not a fatalism of inaction-one that will paralyse all effort on the part of man. Side by side with fatalistic verses in the Satakas there are a number of others which impress the necessity of industry Bhexhorts his readers to put forth strenuous exertions and to persevere in their work till it is accomplished.

THE TEACHINGS OF THE SATAKAS.

 It has been already stated that Bhartrhari was not a Buddhist. He speaks of the Vedas with the deepest respect, and makes frequent references to the chief Vedântin doctrines. He speaks of being absorbed in Brahma as the highest bliss. He refers to the method of attaining this blissful position as being the eradication of Karma, and the annihilation of infatuation by means of real knowledge. These are the ohief doctrines of Vedantism, and Bhartrhari therefore must be considered to be follower of the Vedanta system of philosophy. Here and there he refers to Yoga, to the ten incarnations, to the Ganges, and to the sacred regions of the Himalayas also. In the Nitišataka Bhartrhari inculeates certain principles intended to guide men in their daily life. First and foremost of these is Belf-[respect](#%20The%20students%20find%20out%20the%20references " The students find out the references")." He points out the value of independence and asks his readers not to lose self-respect in the midst of even overwhelming difficulties and trials in sloks couched in very impressive language. Another virtue to which the poet draws attention is Perseverance. Men of firm minds, says he, carry to a successful issue whatever they undertake. A third virtue which he holds up for our admiration and imitation is Benevolence or service of our fellow-men. This lofty virtue he inculcates in verses which are at once beautiful and instructive. Again Bh. inspires in our



 hearts admiration and love for the sublime virtue of moral courage. He assigns to character the highest place among human virtaes as carrying with it a number of blessings. In the Vairágya Sataka the poet inculcates the principle of renunciation. He tells us to undermine desire, in verges which hold out the greed of worldly men to ridicule and the arrogance of the rich to contempt. He exhorts his readers to turn from worldly pleasures which give not lasting happiness but often disappoint, and to seek mental calm in the solitude of the forest. There, with all desires gone, his mindresting on God who is the only controller of the universe, and happy like a king an ascetic can attain final beatitude and get happiness which alone is permanent by being absorbed in the great Almighty. The poet often draws a glowing picture of the perfect happiness which men who have renounced the world enjoy.

LITERARY ESTIMATE OF THE ŚATAKAS.

Mr. Dutt [says](#History%20of%20Civilisation%20in%20ancient%20India,%20vol.%20II,%20p.%20294. "History of Civilisation in ancient India, vol. II, p. 294.") —"The reader will appreciate the opinion of Prof Lassen that it is the terse and epigramatic character of Bhartrhari's short poems which makes them conspicuous among the productions of the Indian muse; and the perfect art with which they are composed makes them worthy of being ranked among the master-pieces of Indian genius." The style is on the whole simple, but sometimes the meaning is obscure owing to an attempt at brevity at the sacrifice of perspicuity. Some of the shorter verses are written in a particularly graceful and forcible style which had endeared them to the general reader and assigned them a place on the tip of every tongue conversant with Sanskrt. The longer metres are on the whole free from long and parplexing compounds. In some cases there is one line, generally the last, which contains rather a long compound. This however Serves to give the style greater dignity which a tame ending could not do. True, there is not melody in the lines, but their artless and simple diction corresponds well with the subject, which, in both the *S'atakas,*embodied in this little volume, is moral and religious



 instruction. The Slokas in both the Śatakas are embellished with figures of speech which are natural and of the simpler sort. To impress a prinsiple on the mind of the reader, Bhartrhari generally puts forth a wealth illustration, often drawn from nature, which is but seldom equalled; and his delineation of character is so varied, and so striking and his observation of natural phenomena so close that we must believe that he was a minute observer of the world. This minute observation, it may be presumed, has enabled him to discharge his self–imposed task of a didactic post with so much success, as is attested by the high popularity which he enjoys, and the unique position which he nolds in the history of Sanskrt literature.

PREFACE.

TO

THE SECOND EDITION. (1902)

 In the preparation of this Second Edition of the Niti and Vairâgya Śatakas sufficient care has been taken to revise the Notes and Translation as critically and minutely as was possible. Much valuable help was derived from Mr. K. M. Joglekar's Edition of the *S'atakas* for which I feel greatly thankful to him.

 Third Edition-1910,M. R. KA'LE.

FOURTH EDITION,

 In revising the text of the *Śatakas* for this edition I had the advantage of consulting two more Mas. and the Nir. Ed. with the com. of R'amachandrabudhendra. By the light of these the slokas in the two Śatakas have been rearranged under different heads. Such an arrangement of the slokesmight have been the work of later editors or writers as some think, but it has at least this advantage—vis. all that the post whishes to say on a particular theme is brought together instead of being scattered pell-mell here and there and can thus be better understood. The Sans.com, has been amplified some useful matter being added. The notes and translation also have been carefully revised.

TRANSLATION  
OF  
NÎTIS'ATAKA.

![](../books_images/U-IMG-1699161415Screenshot2023-11-05104603333333333..png)

 1. Salutation to that peaceful Majesty whose form is pure knowledge, infinite and unconditioned by space, time, &c., and the principal means of knowing which is self-perception.

 2. She of whom I think ceaselessly is indifferent to me: she yearns after another man, and he is attached to a third person; while some other woman pines away for me: fie on that woman, on him, and on the God of Love, as well as on this woman and on me.

 3. An ignorant man can be pleased easily; a wise man can be pursuaded the more easily; but, the God Brahmá himself will not be able to win over a man puffied up with a gain of knowledge.

 4. One might forcibly take out a jewel from the midst of the jaws of a shark; one might cross even the sea, agitated on account of a succession of waves rising high; one might place on one's head even an infuriated serpent as if it were a flower, but one cannot please the heart of a perverse fool (or the perverse mind of a fool).

 5. Sedulously pressing sand, one may get oil even from it; a person parched with thirst may drink water even in a mirage; roaming (here and there), a person may, perchance, find the horn of a hare; but no one will be able to propitiate a confirmed blockhead.

 6. He who wishes to lead wicked men to the path of the good, with wise words that sprinkle nectar (as it were), tries to bind an elephant with a tender lotus-stalk,



 or attempts to cut a diamond with the edge of a *S'irisha*flower, or desires to impart sweetness to the salt (waters of) the ocean with one drop of honey.

 7. The Creator has created a certain and effective disguise for ignorance which can be readily commanded, viz. silence, which, especially in an assembly of learned men, becomes to ignorant folks a befitting ornament.

 8. When I knew a little, I was blinded by pride, às an elephant is by rut; and my mind was elated with the thought "I am an omniscient being". When (however), by keeping company with the wise, I learnt bit by bit, the fever of pride entirely disappeared at the thought that I was a fool.

 9. When munching with unparalleled relish and delight a human bone, fleshless, stinking, covered with a swarm of worms, clammed with saliva and nauseating, a cur is not abashed to behold even Indra standing near: a mean wretch does not mind the worthlessness of his belongings.

 10. The Ganges falls from heaven on the head of S'iva; from the head of the Lord of beings to the mountain Himalaya; from the lofty, mountain to the plain (lit. the earth): and from thence into the ocean. Thus going down and down the Ganges here has been reduced to a low posi- tion: or there is no cause for wonder; in a hundred ways. ruin overtakes those that have lost their discernment.

 11. It is possible to counteract (the working of) fire with water, and the heat of the sun with an umbrella; to control a lordly elephant with a sharp goad, and an infuriated bull and an ass with a cudgel; to cure illness by taking medicine, and to countermine the (effect of) poison by the use of spells. Every thing has an antidote prescrihed for it in the *S'astras,* but for a fool there is none.



 12. A person, unacquainted with poetics, music and the arts, is, in fact, a beast without the horns and the tail; and it is the highest piece of good luck for beasts that he lives without eating grass.

 13. Those who do not possess learning, or practise penance or give gifts, or have knowledge, character, virtue or religious merit, roam in the mortal world as beasts in a human form, a mere burden to the earth.

  14. Better would it be to wander in company with foresters through the inaccessible regions of mountains than to live in the company of fools even in the halls of the Lord of gods.

  15. That renowned learned men whose speech is charming owing to the use of words refined by tho *S'âstras* and whose knowledge is worth being imparted to disciples. live in poverty in the dominions of a king, bespeakes the stupidity (want of appreciation) of the king. Even without wealth learned men are kings. The jewels are not to blame but the wicked lapidaries by whom they are appraised much below their worth.

 16. The secret treasure of knowledge is not destroyed even at the end of the world, does not fall into the hands of a thief, ever yeilds some (indescribable) happiness, and when given to those that solicit it, increases plentifully. Cast away your pride, ye king, towards those who have this treasure. Who can rival them?

 17. Do not despise wise men who have obtained the highest good; wealth, worthless as grass, stands not in their way; a lotus-fibre cannot present any obstacle to elephants whose temples have been darkened with a stream of fresh rut.

 18. (If he is) highly incensed, the Creator can deprive the swan only of the luxury of residing in a bed of lotus–



 plants; but he cannot rob the bird of his universal reputation for skill in separating milk from water.

 19. Bracelets do not beautify a person, nor do necklaces resplendent like the moon, nor bathing, nor anointing(with rubbed sandal &c.), nor (wearing) flowers, nor bedecked hair. Speech alone beautifies a person when it is possessed in a refined form. (Other) ornaments wear away continuously; the ornament of speech is the (only). one which lasts for over.

 20. Learning is verily the highest (mark of or, additional) beanty for man; it is a treasure concealed and well protected; it places within his reach enjoyment, honour and happiness; it is an object of reverence even to those who are worthy of reservence; while journeying in strange lands it is a friend; and it is the highest diety;. learning is honoured by kings, but not wealth; one destitute of learning is a beast.

 21. If men have forgiveness, why should they require an armour; no (other) enemies (are required to ruin) them. if they are hot-tempered; if there are kins-people, where is the necessity of fire? (i. e. they will do the destructive work of fire); if there is a friend, what use is there of medicines of sovereign virtue? What need is there of serpents if wicked men (exist)? Of what account is wealth if there is blameless learning? What is the use of ornaments. if (one has) (a proper sense of) shame? If there is sweet. poesy, of what good is kingdom?

 22. The stability of the world solely depends on those men who are expert in the following arts:—courtesy to words one's relations, kindness towards strangers, cunning towards the wicked, affection for virtuous men, policy towards princes, humility towards the learned, bravery in



 dealing with one's enemies, patience with the elders, and shrewdness towards women.  
 23. Good company removes the dulness of intellect, infuses truth into speech, bestows great honour, removes sin, purifies the heart, and spreads fame in all directions; say what it does not secure for men.  
 24. Victorious are the blessed poets-in-chief, conversant with all sentiments, whose bodies in the form of fame enojoy immunity from old age and death.  

 25. A well–behaved son, a chaste and loving wife, a master ready to bestow favours, an affectionate friend, honest servants, the mind free from the least trouble, a lovely form, abiding prosperity, and a face effulgent with learning; all these can be obtained by a mortal if Hari, who gratifies desires and pleases the world is propitiated.  

 26. Refraining from destroying life, self-restraint as regards appropriating the wealth of others, truthful speech, charity at the right time and according to means, not talking about the young wives of others, impeding the stream of greed, humility towards elders, compassion for all creatures—this is the way to happiness common in all the scriptures, that never fails in its operation (or vitiates no other ordinance).

 27. For fear of obstacles, nothing is begun at all by persons who are low–spirited; ordinary people begin and stop when thwarted by difficulties; but the best of (*i. e.*resolute) men, though repeatedly repelled by adverse circumstances, do not give up what they have (once) undertaken.  

 28. A course of conduct pleasing and upright (at once), not stooping to a sinful act even when life is in danger,



 never to supplicate the wicked nor to beg of a friend who has very little wealth, living nobly in adversity, and following in the footsteps of the great,—by whom has this vow, as difficult (to perform) as walking on the edge of a sword, been taught to the good

 29. Though grown weak on account of hunger (starvation), emaciated by old age, almost unnerved and reduced to a pitiable state, with all energy lost and life dying out of him, will the lion, foremost among those who are great in self–respect, ever eat withered grass when his desire is (habitually) fixed solely on making a morsel of the broken. temples of a rutting elephant ?

 30. On securing even a little bone, fleshless and dirty, with small remnants of fat and muscless (still left), a dog is satisfied although it does not satisfy his hunger. (But) a lion kills an elephant, despising a jackal that has even fallen into his clutches. Every one, though overtaken by difficulty, desires a fruit according to the state of his mind (or in born disposition)

 31. A dog wags his tail, falls at the feet of his master (lit. feeder), and falling on the ground exhibits his mouth and maw; but the lordly elephant looks grave and eats after (when coaxed with) hundreds of flattering words.

 32. In this revolving world who is not born and who is not dead (or, what dead person, indeed, is not born. again)? He (alone is truly ) born by whose birth the family is raised to eminence.

 33, High–minded people have a two-fold course of action like a bunch of flowers, *viz.* to stand at the head (in the case of flowers—*on* the heads,) of all men, or to wither away in a forest.



 34. There are even others—Brhaspati chief among them, five or six in number, that are honourable (enough); but Ràhu, delighting in (showing) his peculiar prowess (or, showing his prowess against a distinguished adversary), does not act inimically towards them. On the new and full moon days the demon-chief, whose head is the only remnant part of his body, mark, friend, eclipses only two, the luminous sun and the bright moon.

 35. S'es'a supports the row of the worlds on his shelflike hood; he is ever held on his back by the great Tortoise; even him, the ocean consigns with little concern to the abyss (of its water); oh! unbounded is the magnificence of the actions of the great I

 36. Better would it have been (for Maináka) to have his wings lopped off with the strokes of the thunderbolthurled by the proud Indra, strokes which were unbearable on account of the flames of fire proceeding thickly from the thunderbolt; but alas, for the son of the snowy mountain a plunge into the waters of the ocean was not proper, when his father (Himálaya) was beside himself with pain.

 37. Since even the insentient sun-jewel emits burning heat when touched by the *Padas* (feet-the rays) of the sun, how can a man of mettle then brook an insult offered by others?

 38. A lion, though young, attacks elephants whose rampart-like temples are soiled with rut; this is the nature. of the valiant; age, indeed, is not the cause of valour.

 39. Let caste go to the nether world, and let the aggregate of virtues sink lower still; let goodness of character fall from a precipice, and nobility be burnt down with fire; let the thunderbolt strike at once bravery which is no friend (to



 us); wealth alone be ours, without which all these virtues are like (of as little worth as) a piece of straw.

 40. There are the limbs, all the same; the action the same; the same unimpaired intellect; and speech also the same; and yet the same man, destitute of the warmth of wealth, becomes instantaneously a changed being; this is strange.

 41. The man who possesses wealth is (considered) nobleborn; he is learned, well-informed, and an appreciator of merits; he alone is an orator and a handsome man; (in short) all qualifications cling to wealth.

 42. On account of evil counsel is ruined a king; an anchorite by attachment to worldly pleasures; a son by indulgence; a Bráhmaṇa by not studying the Vedas; a family by a misbehaved son; character by association with the wicked; modesty by wine; husbandry by want of attention; affection by resorting to travel; friendship by want of courtesy; prosperity by bad management; and wealth by misdirected charity'( or careless expenditure).

 43. Charity, enjoyment, and destruction are the three courses by which wealth passes away. He who neither gives nor enjoys has the third course (left for his wealth).

 44. A jewel polished on the grindstone, à victorious warrior wounded with weapons, an elephant emaciated on account of rutting, a river with its waters (lit. sandy bed) shrunken in winter, the moon with an only digit remaining, a young woman become languid through amorous sports, and persons whose wealth has been bestowed on supplicants—all these look graceful by their slenderness.

 45. When poor, a man longs for a handful of rice; when afterwards he is full (of wealth) he regards the whole earth



 as straw. Hence we must say that for want of fixity as regards the smallness or largeness of the objects of desire. the position of the wealthy magnifies or lessens things (i.e. their value ).

 46. O king, if you wish to milk this cow-like earth, then first nourish (enrich) the nation as they do the calf? when the nation (the people) is being constantly enriched, the earth, like the desire-granting creeper, yields a variety of fruits.

 47. Now truthful, now false; at one time harsh, at another speaking sweetly; now cruel and merciful afterwards; now parsimonious, but anon liberal; ever spending wealth and ever gaining large sums of money—thus the policy of kings, like a harlot, assumes a diversity of forms.

 48. What is the use of these men becoming the king's servants (lit. resorting to the king) who do not possess the six qualities, viz. the power to command, fame, the protection of Brahmanas, charity, the enjoyment of pleasures and the protection of friends.

 49. Whatever amount of wealth, large or small, might have been allotted to (lit. written on the forehead of) a man, he certainly obtains even in the country called Maru; on the mountain Meru he will not be able to get more. Have patience then, and do not adopt a servile course of conduct towards the wealthy for nothing. See that a jar draws (lit. takes up) the same quantity of water from a well as well as from the sea.

 50. O magnanimous cloud, who does not know that you alone are the supporter of the *Châtakas*? Why do you then wait for our plaintive appeal?

 51. Oh friend *Chataka*, listen (to me) with an attentive mind for a moment; there are many clouds in the sky, but



 they are not all of them such (that a supplication should be addressed to them); some of them moisten the earth with showers, (whereas) others roar for nothing; do not utter a piteous cry before every one that you happen to see.

 52. Cruelty, unprovoked opposition, lust of another's wealth and wife, and envy of good men and relations these are natural with the wicked.

 53. Though adorned with learning a wicked man should be avoided. Is not a serpent dangerous (although it is) bedecked with a jewel?

 54. Dulness is attributed to a modest man; hypocrisy to one who has a liking for religious observances; roguery to one who leads a life of sanctity; cruelty to a warrior; want of discrimination to one devoted to meditation; meanness to one who speaks agreeably; arrogance to a spirited man; garrulity to an orator; and imbecility to a steady man. What virtue is there then that is not stigmatised by the wicked?

 55. If avarice forms part of a man's character, why should he need other bad qualities; if there be wickedness, why want sins; if truthfulness, religious austerities; if there is purity of heart why should he go on a pilgrimage? If he has goodness of heart why should he want relatives? If he has reputation, ornaments are superfluous. If he possesses learning, what need he care for wealth (v. 1. the people )? If he has a bad name why should he need death?

 56. The moon, pale by day (i. e. day-light), a beautiful woman past youth, a lake without lotuses, the unlettered mouth of a man with a fair exterior, a king solely given to hoarding wealth, a virtuous man ever plunged in misery, and a wicked man having access to a king's court—these are the seven barbs in my heart.



 57. No one is, indeed, a favourite of kings whose anger is extremely fierce; the fire burns even the sacrificer offering an oblation, when touched.

 58. The duty of service is most difficult to be understood; it is beyond the ken of even sages: (for a servant is called), dump if he is silent ! (if he is) ready with his answer, he is talkative or garrulous; if he stands near, he is impudent; and then if he keeps at a distance, he is timid; if he bears patiently, he is a coward; if he cannot brook (harsh words, insults, &c.) he is generally considered unmannerly.

 59. Who can live happily when within the range of a wicked man who hates merit, who has by chance attained greatness, and has forgotten his former mode of obtaining a living by base deeds, and who free from all restraint, has whitewashed all other wicked people.

 60. The friendship of wicked men and of good men differs like the shadow in the first and the second half of the day (respectively)—extensive at the beginning, but gradually contracting (in the first part, while in the latter) at first scant, but attaining growth afterwards.

 61. The deer, the fish, and the virtuous, living on grass, water and contentment respectively (find) in this world unprovoked enemies (in):the hunter, the fisherman, and the wicked.

 62. A bow to those men in whom reside the following sterling qualities:—desire for the company of the virtuous, satisfaction at the merits of others, humility towards elders, attachment to learning, love for one's own wife, fear of calumny, devotion to the Trident–holder (Siva),. strength to restrain the self, and freedom from the contact of wicked men..



 63. Fortitude in adversity, forgiveness in prosperity, cleverness of speech in an assembly, valour in war, a liking (earnest desire) for fame, and untiring application to the study of the Vedas—all these are natural with the magnanimous.

 64. Who taught this course of conduct, difficult like lying on the edge of a sword-blade, to the good, viz. charity well concealed, quick reception to him who comes to their house, silence after doing good, not announcing in public their kindness (to others), freedom from arrogance in prosperity, and speaking of others in terms free from disrespectfulness.

 65. Laudable charity for the hand, submission at the feet of elders for the head, true words for the mouth, incomparable valour for victorious arms, a quiescent state for the heart, Vedic knowledge (acquired by the ears) for the ears; of high-souled person these are the ornaments. even though they have no wealth.

 66. In prosperity the mind of magnanimous men becomes tender like a lotus, while in adversity it becomes hard as a solid rock.

 67. Not the least trace of water is to be found when it falls (lit. stands) upon heated iron; the same, lying on a lotus–leaf, shines assuming the form of pearls; it is transformed into a pearl when it falls into the cavity of the shells in the sea while (the sun is) in conjunction with the constellation

Svali

.In general, the lowest, the mediocre, and the highest degree of excellence is imparted (to a thing) by association..



 68. He is a son who pleases his father with good actions; that is a wife who desires the good alone of her husband; that is a friend who acts the same way in adversity as in happy times. The meritorious (alone) secure these three things in this world.

 69. Rising by bending low (i. e. by their humility), evidencing their own merits by extolling those of others, gaining their ends by projecting extensive schemes for (the good of) others, and censuring calumniators, whose tongues (lit. mouths) are noisy with harsh syllables of accusation, with their patience alone—virtuous men of such extraordinary behaviour and highly esteemed in the world—who will not adore them?

 70. Trees become bent (i.e. humble) with the harvest. of fruits; with newly–formed waters the clouds hang very low; good men with (the acquisition of) wealth become meek; this is the nature of benevolent persons.

 71. The ear is graced by Vedic knowledge alone, and not by an ear-ring; the hand by charity, not by a bracelet; the body of beneficent people by kindness towards others, and not by sandal-paint. 

 72. Wise people thus describe the characteristics of a true friend;—he (i. e. a good friend) dissuades (you) from sin, urges (you) to good action, keeps (your) secrets, publishes (your) merits, does not forsake you (when you are). in distress, and helps (you, lit. gives you) in time of need.

 73. The sun causes the group of sun-lotuses to expand without a solicitation; the moon, though unasked, causes the moon-lotuses to bloom; and the cloud yields water without being solicited; good people direct their efforts-towards the good of others of their own accord.



 74. Those are the noblest persons who, giving up self-interest, bring about the good of others; those that under-take a business for the sake of others, not inconsistent. with their own good, are men of the middle order; those that stand in the way of the good of others for their own benefit are demons in a human form; but we know not what to call them (lit. who they are) that oppose the good of others without any advantage to themselves. 

 75. Milk, at first, imparted all (its) qualities to its constituent water; on seeing the distress of milk (i. e. when it was heated) water sacrificed itself in the fire (i. e. became evaporated); seeing the distress of its friend (i.e. water), it (viz, milk) became very eager to throw itself into the fire (lit. to go to the fire, i. e. began to boil over); but it settled down when united with that water—such is the friendship of the good.

 76. In one part sleeps Kes'ava; in another is the host of his foes; in a third the chain of mountains seeking shelter; in another part yet is Vádava (submarine) fire with all the world-destroying fires. Oh, how extensive, deep and enduring is the expanse of the sea!

 77, Cutdown (check) desire, have recourse to patience, give up pride, fix not (your) attachment on sinful deeds, speak the truth, follow the footsteps of the good, serve the learned, reverence those that deserve respect, conciliate (your) enemies, do not parade your good qualities, pre–serve fame and sympathise with those in ditress; this is the characteristic of the good.

 78. Very few good men are there who, full of the nectar of holiness in thought, word and action and pleasing the three worlds with numerous acts of beneficence, rejoice (lit.



 bloom) at heart in ever magnifying the minute good. qualities of others.

 79. What is to be done with the mountain of gold or the mountain of silver, the trees growing (lit. resting) upon which remain the same as they are; we honour the mountain Malaya alone, by resorting to which even the*Kanhöla*, the *Neem* and the *Kutaja* become sandal trees.

 80. With (the acquisition of) valuable jewels the gods were not satisfied; and at the dread poison they were not terrified; they did not suspend the labours until they obtain nectar. Resolute persons do not swerve from a policy once determined upon.

 81. Sometimes lying on the ground and sometimes on a couch, sometimes subsisting on vegetables and sometimes tasting rice prepared from the *S'ali * variety, sometimes wearing a wallet and at others superfine garments, a highsouled man, pursuing (his cherished) object, does not care. for ease or hardship.

 82. Good-naturedness (kind behaviour) is the ornament of greatness; silence of valour, restraint over the sense of learning, humility of (Vedic) knowledge, spending in the right direction (or, bestowal on worthy recipient) of wealth, freedom from anger of austerities; for- giveness of a man in power, and freedom from hypocrisy of religious observances; while good character, which is the root of all these, is the highest ornament of all.

 83. Let men versed in policy praise or blame; let the goddess of wealth enter (their house) or go away (from it) as she likes; let death come even to-day or in another age; persons of mental calibre do not swerve from the path of justice.



 84. The virtue of courage of a heroic person cannot be obliterated though he be worried; though pointed down-wards the flame of fire does not point to the ground.

 85. That courageous man conquers the triple world whose mind the arrow-like side-glances of women do not hurt, the heat-of-fire-like anger does not burn and the numerous sensual objects do not draw (towards them). with their captivating snares.

 86. A ball, though struck on the ground with a blow from the hand, does rebound upwards; generally the misfortunes of the virtuous are not everlasting (are temporary).

 87. Better if this body falls from the lofty peak of ahigh mountain against some rugged surface and is shattered to pieces in the midst of rough rocks; better is the hand thrust into the fangs of a huge serpent of deadly bite, better failing into the fire; but not the wrecking of one'scharacter.

 88. The fire acts like water, the ocean becomes like a streamlet, Mera like a small stone, the lion like a deer, the serpent like a wreath of flowers and poisonous juice like a shower of nectar, to him in whose person becomes mani-fest good character which is prized most by all men.

 89. A tree, though cut down, grows again; the moon, though waned, waxes again; thus reflecting good men are not troubled in this world, when plunged in misery.

 90. Indra was worsted in battle by his enemies; though possessed of greatness and prowess–even he who had Brhas-pati for his adviser, the thunderbolt for his weapon, the gods for his soldiers, and the heaven for his citadel; he verily enjoyed the favour of Hari (Vishnu), and had Air–avata for his elephant; it is clear, then, that it is better to submit to fate; oh, fie I valour is useless.



 91. A mouse, gnawing a hole into a basket, at night, fell into the mouth of a serpent that, with its body pent up in a basket and its limbs weakened by starvation, had grown despondent. Filled with its meat the serpent quickly glided away through the same opening (lit. the same passage viz. the hole made by the mouse); see, my men, it is destiny alone that is the cause of the rise and fall of men.

 92. The fruit which men get depends on action (done in a former life), and the inducement to action is in consonance with it (action done in a previous life ); still a wise man should be doing a thing only after mature consideration.

 93. A bald man, scorched on the head by the rays of the sun and wishing for a shady place, went to (rest under) a palm tree; even there, a big fruit falling (from the tree) broke his pate with a crash. Verily misfortunes do, indeed, go there where a luckless man goes.

 94. When I see the sun and the moon oppressed by the planet (Rahu), the captivity of the elephant and the snake and the poverty of men of intellect, I come to think—Oh, destiny is all powerful !

 95. In the first place, the Creator creates an excellent man, the ornament of earth and the mine of all good qualities; but if he makes him short-lived, then alast woe to the indiscretion of Vidhil

 96. Though he is the repository of nectar; and the lord of herbs, though he is followed by S'atabhishak (the constellation of that name—a hundred physicians) and is the crest-ornament of S'iva's head, consumption does not leave the Moon: or by whom can the ordinance of cruel Fate be transgressed?

 97. That, which is fixed as a man's portion in this world by all-powerful Destiny, will go to him; patronage of the  
 N. T. 2



 great (lit. great patronage) is not at all the cause (of the aquisition). Although the cloud, the gratifier of the desires of all beings, showers daily, only two or three minute drops of water fall into the mouth the *Chataka.* 

 98. When on the branch of the *karira* tree there is not a single leaf, it is not the fault of the spring. If the owl cannot see by day what blame is due to the sun? Showers of rain do not fall into the mouth of the *châtaha;* but why blame. the clund for that? Who is able to wipe off what has once been written on the forehead by fate?

 99. We shall bow to the gods, but then, even they are subject to the accursed fate; (in that case) fate ought to receive our homage; but even fate dispenses but the fruits consistent with each action. The fruit being dependent on action what (have we to do) with the gods and what with fate! Bow to those *Karmans* then, which even fate cannot control.

 100. A bow to that *Karman* by whom Brahmá was confined in the interior of the pot–like primordial egg (there to evalve his creation) like a potter; by whom Vishnu was hurled into the very troublesome intricacy of the ten incarnations; by whom S'iva has been compelled to wander for alms skull in hand; and in obedience to whom the sun ever roams in the sky.

 101. A handsome form avails not; neither does descentnor character; not even learning, nor service assiduously rendered. Good luck, the result of (lit. stored by) past religious performances fructifies for man seasonably, as do trees.

 102. Meritorious deeds done in a former life protect a man in a forest, on a battlefield, in the midst of foes, or water or fire, in the vast ocean, or on a mountain-top, whether he be asleep or careless or in a perilous condition.



 103. O good man, to obtain your cherished desire, adore that goddess—Good conduct–that changes wicked men into good, fools into wise men, enemies into friends, the invisible into the visible and deadly poison into nectar, in an instant. Fix not your hopes on numerous other qualities with persistent application.

 104. When good luck is favourable to one (lit. closely linked), a splendid mansion, sportive women and prosperity brilliant with the white umbrella—all these things are enjoyed for a long time; but when unfavourable (lit. when its thread is snapped) behold! all these vanish in all directions like a wreath of pearls, the thread of which is broken. in the sport of amorous quarrels.

 105. A wise man, bent on doing, a thing, good or bad, should first carefully consider its consequence. The issue of actions done in hot haste becomes, till death, like a dart, poignant to the art.

 106 The luckless man that does not practise penance on coming into this Land of *Karman,* cooks (as it were) with sandal-wood, &c. for fuel, in a utensil made of the*Vaidurya gem,* the oil-cake of sesamum; or ploughs the earth with a golden ploughshare for the sake of the root of the *Arka* tree, or makes a hedge round a crop of*Kodravas* of camphor-trees having cut them down.

 107. That which is not to take place, never takes place, nor is a thing fated to take place averted, in this world, owing to the force of destiny, thongh:a man may dive into water, ascend to the top of the mountain Meru, conquer enemies in battle, learn trade, agriculture and all other arts and sciences, (or) pass like a bird with great effort through the infinite sky.



 108. To a man possessing immense merit (laid by) in a former life, a dreary forest becomes a capital city, all men act in a friendly way towards him and the whole earth becomes full of precious deposits and gems.

————————

MISCELLANEOUS.

 1. Sloth is a dreadful enemy abiding in the body of man; there is not friend like industriousness by resorting to which a man is never ruined.

  2. What is an advantage gained? The company of the virtuous. What is misery? The company of those that are not learned. What is loss? Wasting an opportunity. What is perfection? Being devoted to one's religious principles. Who is a brave man? One that has restrained his senses.= What woman is most beloved? One that is devoted. What is wealth? Learning. What is happiness? Not going on a journey. What is kingdom? The power to command.

 3. High-souled persons have, like the *Málati * flower, two fates(in store for them) either to be at the head of all. men, or to fade away in a forest.

 4. The earth is here and there adorned by persons who are poor in unpalatable speech, rich in pleasing words,. content with connubial happiness and desisting from. calumniating others.

 5. As by the sun of profusely glittering splendpur, so by a warrior, though single-handed, the entire surface of the earth is covered (overpowered) with his ***pa'das*** (feet i. e.. power; rays-in the of the sun).

 6. Spirited men, devoted to the performance of the vow of truthfulness, sacrifice their lives willingly but not.



 their vow which is the source of modesty and numerous other good qualities, which keeps the heart exceedingly. pure and is binding like a mother of exceedingly pure heart and attached to one.

 7. Like unto the face reflected in a mirror the heart of woman cannot be caught (comprehended); their feeling, intricate like the faint mountain-track, cannot be gauged; their heart has been described by the wise as fickle like water on a lotus-leaf; a woman growing with faults is, evidently, like a creeper growing with its poisonous shoots.

 8. Leave aside the question whether a man, wounded while facing the enemy attain victory or heaven; the applause of both the armies is, indeed, intensely gratifying to the ear.

 9. In all this collection of exceedingly wonderful things, whether of this nature, or of such extent, either Varáha or Ráhu, pre-eminently stand out as an object of wonder: (the former) in that he alone bore up the earth when it was sunk in water; the latter, the head-remuant, in that he swallows his enemy (the sun), and afterwards throws him out.

 10. The earth is bounded by the ocean; that store of waters is a hundred *yojanas * in extent; the sun, evertravelling measures the expanse of the sky;—thus in most cases, things are confined within well-defined bounds; but victorious is the intellectual brilliancy of the good (wise) that is unlimited !

 11. (Let me have) one god—Kes'ava or S'iva; one friend, the king or an ascetic; one abode—in the city or in a wilderness; and one (thing more) a charming wife, or a cave.

 12. This earth, though supported dy the Tortoise, the (seven) principal mountains, the (eight) principal elephants and by the serpent king, shakes nevertheless. The under–



 taking of pure-minded persons (alone) shakes not (remains firm) even at the time of the final dissollution (of the world).

 13. Does not the Tortoise feel pain in his body on account of his burden, that he does not throw off the earth, or does not the lord of the day feel fatigue, in that he never remains motionless? (Yes they do). But a worthy man, when going to give up his undertaking, feels shame inwardly; for carrying to their completion things (once) undertaken is the hereditary vow of the good.

 14. Who, in the world, does not become submissive when his mouth is filled with a morsel?—a *Mrdanga* gives out a sweet sound when its face is coated (with dongh).

 15, Thousands of mean fellows there are, who are busy only in maintaining themselves. He alone stands at the head of the good, who considers the interest of others as his own. The Vâdava fire drinks the sea to fill its insatiable maw, but the cloud to alleviate the heat caused by the summer to the world.

 16. Verily a statesman, who brings in new wealth from afar, avoiding dispute (or, war, lit. the sound of bows) al together, becomes engrossed in pleasing the assembly of the wise and takes his steps slowly and solwly agreeably to the heart (wishes) of the subjects, is never free from the burden of anxiety, like a poet who brings outcharming (lit. fresh) meaning (from words which are) far apart (in sense), leaves at a distance unsuitable words again, becomes deeply engaged in pleasing the assembly of the wise, and arranges words with care agreeably so popular taste.

 17. Good men should be waited upon, though they may not give good advice (in a special way). For what come from them as random discourses serve as rules for guidance.



 18. Though falling, a noble man generally falls like a ball (i. e. to rise again); but a mean fellow falls like a lump of clay (never to rise again).

 19. If ever by chance the world became destitute of lotuses, would the swan then, like a cock, scratch a dunghill?

 20. That elephants whose temples are split open by (the line of) rut stand lazy through drowsiness, at the door, as also steeds decked with gold ornaments neigh proudly, and that one is awakened from sleep by the sound of lutes, clarionets, drums, conches, and tabors:—all that, like (the accompaniments) of the lord of heaven, is the manifestation of the power of religious merit.

 21. Redness in lotuses, beneficence in good men, and ruthlessness in the wicked—these three are by nature established respectively in the three.

 22. True speech is the highest ornament for man; modesty for a woman and slenderness of the middle; (with the reading गजा०—for a woman with the stately gait of an elephant slenderness &c.); and for the twice born, learning and in addition patience. Good character is an ornament fof all men.

 23. Beloved one, wicked fate, having, like a skilful potter, per force rolled our mind into a ball of clay, as it were, whirls it round and round by placing it on the wheel of anxiety which revolves being driven by a series or strokes from the rod in the form of adversity; we know not what fate will do!

 24. If you desire to see the courage of magnanimous persons give way in times of difficulty, desist from this wicked pursuit, all trouble in which must be fruitless—



 O you block-head these are not the * Kula*-mountains nor the oceans either which transgress their usual bounds at the time of the universal destruction—but insignificant on that account.

 25. The goddess of victory likes the chest of warriors. lacerated with the nail-like-long sword, just as an accomplished and grown up handsome woman longs for the chest of brave men scratched by her nails long and piercing like a sword.

OF  
VAIRA´GYAS´ATAKA.  
![](../books_images/U-IMG-1699624470Screenshot2023-11-10192333144444444444.png)

 1. Hara, the powerful lamp of knowledge, shines. bright in the house of the heart of ascetics; the lamp, which is resplendent with the flickering flame of light. from the beautiful digit of the moon, worn as crestornament, which barnt, with ease, the moth in the shope of the bustling Káma (the god of love), which sheds its quivering light at the top of the wick of supreme happiness. and which completely destroys the mass of darkness of unbounded infatuation existing (i. e, in the heart).

 2. Learned men (who can appreciate good speech) are overpowered by jealousy; rich men are blinded by arrogance; and by ignorance are smitten the rest of the people. (Hence) good speech is absorbed in the body (finds no vent for want of encouragement).

 3. I dug up the earth expecting to find a treasure; smelted the ores found in mountains; crossed the lord of rivers (the ocean), assiduously propitiated king; passed several nights in the cemetery solely intent upon securing the efficacy of incantations; (but after all) I have not obtained even a broken cowrie. Leave me now, thou, Greed.

 4. I wandered over the country ragged with numerous impassable tracts but did not gain any thing; giving up the proper pride for race and lineage I served (but) to no purpose; banishing all sense of self-respect, I dined in strange houses, fearing like a crow (of being driven away at any moment); but thou waxest still, oh Greed—delighting in wicked deeds—and art not satisfied.



 5. Intent upon propitiating them, I endured with great. difficulty the taunting words of wicked men; checking in my tears I even laughed with a vacant mind; I steadied my heart, and even bowed to the wicked. Disappointed Greed, in what other way wilt thou make me dance ?

 6. For the sake of this life (lit. these vital airs) that is compared to water on a lotus leaf, what, indeed, have we, destitute of discernment, not done?—since in the presence of the rich whose minds are blinded by the pride of wealth, we, shameless that we are, have committed the sin of even mentioning (singing the praises of) our own virtues.

 7. We forbore but not through forgiveness; we relinquished domestic happiness—but not willingly; we endured the pain caused by inclement cold, wind and sun—but did not (thereby) practise auterities; day and night did we think of wealth—but not, with restrained vital airs, of the feet of S'iva. We did the various actions which ascetics perform; but as to the several fruits (obtained by them) we have been deceived.

 8. We have not enjoyed pleasures, but we have been preyed upon (by the destructive influence of time); we have not undergone austerities, but we have been harassed (by worldly cares); time has not lapsed, but the lease of our life; our greed has not decayed but we have.

 9. Wrinkles have made an inroad on the face; the head is marked (with gray hair) all the limbs become. feeble; greed alone keeps its vigour-fresh.

 10. The desire for enjoyments is dead: the pride of youth is quiet: humbled co-eval friends, valued as life itself, have sped quick to heaven; (I have) to stand up slowly supported on a staff; and the eyes are obstructed by powerful blindness: oh the impudence of the body! It is still afraid of being overtaken by death.



 11, Desire is, indeed, a river, with the objects of desire for its water, agitated by waves in the form of hankerings, having for sharks the passions, and for birds the misgivings. (of the heart), destroying the tree of fortitude, difficult to cross on acconnt of eddies in the form of infatuation, very deep and having anxiety for its steep (lit. high) banks; the great ascetics of pure heart, who have crossed it (the river), enjoy felicity.

 12. I no not expect the course of life in this world to turn out happy; the result of meritorious deeds inspires me with fear as I contemplate it; for, enjoyments, long experienced in return for accumulated stores of merit, assume mighty proportions to make the enjoyer miserable, as it were.

 13. Even after remaining with one for a long time pleasures must needs vanish. What more is there in pleasures tearing themselves off from one, that one does not of one's own accord relinquish them? When vanishing of their own accord, they end in keen anguish for the mind; but when relinquished by one of one's own will, they produce infinite happiness proceeding from tranquillity.

 14. Those, who, by the knowledge of Brahman, have. acquired discrimination and possess a refined intellect, do what is hard to do, in that they renounce riches even such as contribute to pleasures, being absolutely unselfish: (these) were neither obtained before, nor are they now; nor is there any certainty (lit. firm belief,) as to their attainment; and still we are not able to renounce them, although their possession (lit. desire) is only a matter of imagination.

 15. Of the blessed persons who dwell in the caves of mountains and contemplate the Supreme Light, birds drink the tears of delight, fearlessly resting on their laps: our life on the other hand, is being wasted, (as) we enjoy the



 delight of sports in the pleasure gardens adjoining the walls of mansions reared up by our imagination.

 16. Alas! the mind does not give up (its longing) for carnal pleasures even when one has to eat food obtained by begging, and that too unsubstantial and once (only in a day); when one has the earth for a conch, and only one's self for an attendant, and when one's raiment is a wallet of a hundred threadbare rags (stitched together).

 17. The breasts which are fleshy protuberances are compared to golden jars; the mouth which is the receptacle of phlegm is likened to the moon; the hips \* \* \*(are described as) rivalling the head of an elephant-king. Mark how the despicable form (of a woman) has been heightened (cried up) by a certain class of poets.

 18. Among passionate persons stands conspicuous S'iva alone, who took for himself half the body of; his beloved, (and yet) to whom there is none superior among passion–renouncing men, as one who has given up his attachment to women; the rest of the people, smitten with the poison of the cobra-like and irresistible shafts of love, and therefore maddened, are able neither to enjoy nor to reject pleasures, which are rendered (mere) objects of mockery by the God of Love.

 19. Let a moth fall upon the flame of a lamp not knowing its power; let the fish through ignorance bite the baited flesh; but even we that know better do not give up sensual objects which are complicated with a net of difficulties. Alas! how mysterious is the influence of infatuation!

 20. The removal of pain man wrongly considers as happiness itself—when the mouth is parched with thirst, he drinks sweet and fragrant water; when oppressed with hunger, he swallows rice mixed with vegetable and other



 condiments: and when the fire of love is kindled he clasps. his wife closely.

 21. A man, infatuated on account of ignorance, enters. on a worldly career which is like a prison, believing the world to be constant, on seeing the towering mansion, the sons esteemed by the good, the boundless wealth, the lovely wife, and the prime of life: but the blessed man renounces all this knowing it to be perishable in a moment.



22. If a man did not see his wife distressed and wearing a care-worn appearance, with hungry and noisy children. ever tugging at her thread-bare raiment with piteous looks, what man, who respects himself, would, for the sake ofhis accursed stomach, say—"Give me"—the syllables being broken and absorbed in the gurgling throat for fear of the supplication being rejected.

 23. The insatiable boiler of the stomach, which is clever in dissolving (lit. cutting) the knot of high pride which is dearly prized, which is like the bright moonshine in causing the lotus-like higher virtues to fade, and which is like an axe in cleaving asunder the luxuriant creeper modesty, causes humiliation.

 24. Blessed is the man of self-respect, who, living in a holy city or in a trackless forest, rather goes, when hungry, from one door to another—the vicinity of which has been darkened by the smoke arising from the fire into which oblations have been offered by Brahmaṇas reciting the Vedic*mantras* with the proper accents-in order to fill the cavity of his stomach, with a broken pot covered with a piece of white cloth; but not so the man who daily humiliates himself in (the presence of) his kinsmen, of equal rank with him.

 25. Are the Himalayan retreats, which are cool on account of the spray of the waves of the Ganges, and the



 charming slabs of which are occupied by Vidyàdharas, no more, that men are fond of a morsel from others (doled out) with an insult?

 26. Have bulbous roots disappeared entirely from the valleys, or the rivulets from mountains, or have branches. bearing delicious fruit and yielding bark-cloth disappeared from trees, that the faces of wicked men devoid of courtesy are looked at in eager expectancy?—faces, the creeper-like eyebrows of which are made to dance by the breeze of pride at having obtained with difficulty a small sum of money?

 27. Arise, dear friend, let us go to the forest, where even the name of big folks is not heard, whose minds mean fellows that they are, are everdistracted by inconsiderateness and whose speech is marred by the effect of the disease of wealth—there maintain yourself now on sacred fruits and roots making the earth your couch and covered with fresh end painful barks of trees-a way of living which is covetable.

 28. There are the fruits of trees obtainable at will in every forest without difficulty; at intervals there is the cool and sweet water of sacred rivers; a bed made of the tender leaves of creepers is soft to the touch; (although these are available) mean persons do yet suffer pain at the gates of the rich.

 29. Seated on a stony couch in the cavern of a mountain, may I, in the intervals of contemplation, recall, with an inward smile, those days which seem to be longer to one. experiencing the misery of (having to address) supplications to the wealthy and which (days) appear to be shorter (to one) whose mind is tossed about by the allurement of sensual objects.

 30. The joys of those who always rejoice in contentment have not been interrupted, nor is the thirst of those others



 quenched, that have their minds agitated by covetousness for wealth. This being the case for whose sake was that Meru made by Brahman a peerless repository of wealth? I like not it, the glory of whose gold is for itself alone.

 31. The great ascetics say that the cult of S'iva is atreasure of inexhaustible happiness which cannot be refused to any one—a cult in which there is (i. e. which enjoius,) maintenance ou charity, in which there is no degradation, which yields unparalleled happiness, which always removes fear, does away with the haughty pride resulting from wicked jealousy, and counteracts the current of miseries, which is easily accessible every day at all places, is preferred by the good, and is holy.

 32. Enjoyment (of pleasures) is accompanied with fear of disease, noble birth is liable to a fall, wealth is exposed to danger from the king, diguity to misfortune, an army to fear from the enemy, beauty to danger from oldage, knowledge of *Satras* to controversy, merits to danger from the wicked, and body to the fear of death; all objects are thus beset with danger; asceticism alone is invulnerable on earth.

 33. Birth is attended with death; vivacious youth with oldage; contentment with cupility; the felicity of renunciation stands in the danger of being disturted by the sportive movements of youtuful women, and virtues by malicious people; wood-lands are infested by serpents; kings are surrounded by wicked people; even prosperity is affected by:inconstancy; or, what is there that is not smitten by something else ?

 34. The health of man is undermined by hundreds of mental and physical infirmities; to where there is wealth. misfortunes come througing as if through gates throw open to them; Death hastily asserts his supremacy over every



 helpless creature that is born; what thing is there then, that despotic Fate has made immune from danger?

 35. Enjoyments are transient like high surging waves, life is liable to pass away in a moment; youthful happiness lasts for a few days only; love for the cherished is fickle; knowing, therefore, that the entire worldly existence is destitute of any good, ye wise men, givers of advice, make the attempt with a mind skilful in (or, intent on) doing good to the people.

 36. Sensual objects are as ephemeral as the lightning shining in the midst of the cloudy canopy; life is frail like the water collected in the row of clouds scattered by the wind; momentary is the youthful happiness of mortals; taking this into consideration, O wise men, fix your mind at once on contemplation of the Supreme Spirit, which it is easy to do when one is a perfect master of (lit. by being perfect in) patience and concentration.

 37. Life is fickle like a swelling wave; the splendour of youth remains only for a certain number of days; wealth is, like thought, momentary; pleasures are like the flashes. of lightning in autumn; even the embrace of the beloved, encircling the neck, lasts not for a long time; so have your attention concentrated upon Brahman, that you should cross the ocean of worldlydangers.

 38. With their bodies cramped, men have to remain with difficulty in the womb in the midst of impurities; in youth the enjoyment of pleasures is difficult on account. of the distraction arising from the pain of separation fromone's beloved; surely old age too is unwelcome, (for at that period the refractoriness of women is conspicuous; say oh men, if there is even the least happiness in worldly life?

 39. Old age stands threatening like a tigress; like enemies diseases smite the body; life runs away like water



 from a broken jar; and yet, oh wonder, man acts in a way de trimental to his interest (does not try to secure *Moksha*).

 40. The enjoyments are multifarious and of a transient nature; and by them is constituted this worldly life; what for should you then wander; oh people? Refrain from your actions (pursnit). If our word is to be believed, concentrate your mind, pure on account of the snapping of the bonds of desires, within its cell which can be within reach when passion is rooted out.

 41. That indescribable pleasure alone is the highest and ever abiding (lit. keeping its flavour ever fresh) being in the enjoyment of which one considers straw (of little importance) the hosts of gods such as Brahmá, Indra and others and on tasting which high states (prosperity) such as the sovereignty of the three worlds &c. lose all charm. O good man, fix not, therefore, your affection on any other enjoyment which is [evanascent](#%C2%A0त्रैलोक्याः—v.l.%C2%A0Having%20attained%20that%20knowledge%20of%20Brahman.%20compared%20with%20which%20the%20very%20sovereignty%20of%20the%20three%20worlds%20becomes%20unpalatable,%20do%20not%20fix%20your%20attachment%20on%20pleasures%20consisting%20of%20food,%20clothes%20and%20honour%20(position). "त्रैलोक्याः—v.l.Having attained that knowledge of Brahman. compared with which the very sovereignty of the three worlds becomes unpalatable, do not fix your attachment on pleasures consisting of food, clothes and honour (position).")."

 42. That delightful city, that great king, and the circle of feudatory kings, and that assembly of eminent scholars. at his side, the ladies (of the court) with their faces like the disc of the moon, and that group of haughty princes, those bards, and those stories—a bow to Death through whose (destructive) power all these things have become things of the past (lit. things to be remembered),

 43. In a certain house (also square of the dice board) where there were many, there (now) stands only one; even there where there was one many followed, and there is not one left at last; thus revolving day and night as if they were two dice, and Godof Death plays (at dice ) with his



 wife Káli making mortals their dice-pieces and the earth. the board.

 44. With the setting and rising of the sun life becomes shorter and shorter day by day; the lapse of time is not felt in business which weighs down a man with the great weight of work; the feeling of disgust is not awakened on beholding the aggregate of birth, old age, miseryand death; the world has been maddened by drinking the intoxicating wine of delusion.

 45. Believing that the night is the same and again the same day, ignorant people run busily in the same manner resolutely (or secretly) setting about their diverse vocations. Oh, how do we not, through infatuation, feel ashamed (though) disgraced by transactions in which there is a repetition of the enjoyment of pleasures, and by this worldly life of such nature ।

 46. For the annihilation of wordly existence we did not contemplate the feet of the Lord, according to the prescribed rules; nor did we accumulate religious merit which is capable of throwing open the doors of heaven; nor did we embrace even in a dream, the pair of the stout (full grown) breasts and thighs of a beautiful woman. We have been (serviceable) simply as axes in cutting down. the forests in form of our mother's prime of life.

 47. We did not in this world acquire learning capable of silencing a host of controversialists, and befitting modest. persons; we did not lead our fame to heaven by shattering with the point of our sword the temples of elephants, we did not, at moon-rise, sip the nectar of the tender-foliage-like lower lip of our beloved; alas! like a lamp in a tenautless. house, our youth has, indeed, passed away uselessly.

 48. We did not acquire untainted knowledge; nor did we amass wealth; we did not even serve our parents with a



 devoted mind; nor did we embrace young women with long sparkling eyes even in a dream; like crows we have passed this period (of our life) craving a morsel from others.

 49. Those from whom we were born have long since passed away; those too, with whom we grew up, have been consigned to the region of memory; now here we are, with our fall approaching nearer and nearer day by day, reduced to the same state as that of trees (growing) on the bank of a sandy river.

 50. The life of men is limited to a hundred years; half of it passes away in the night; of the remaining half one-half made up of its first and last fourths is occupied by youth and oldage; the remainder is passed in servitude &c., accompanied by disease and grief for the separation (of relations). Whence can there be any happiness for mortals. in wordly life which is even more unsteady than a wave?

 51. Like an actor, a man for a time plays the child, and then for an instant the youth delighting in pleasures; for a moment he plays the part of poverty, at another he is full of prosperity; and at the close of life he retires behind. the curtain of Yama's seat, his limbs wasted by old age, and his body graced by wrinkles.

 52. You are a king; we too are exalted by the pride we take in the wisdom acquired from the preceptor whom we served; you are known for your greatness, (even) our fame the poets spread in all directions; thus, O mortifier (of men) the difference between us is not very great; if you turn away your face from us, we too are utterly indifferent (to you).

 53. You are the lord of riches in full, we too of words in all their senses; you are brave, our skill in the act of subduing the feverish prile of a controversialist is inexhaustible, those who are filled with wealth serve you; even me serve



 those that have a longing to listen to me that the taint of their hearts may be removed; if you have no respect for me, the less have I for you; O king, here am I off.

 54. Here we are satisfied with barks, and you with silk garments; the satisfaction is equal in this case and the distinction is without difference. Let him be (called) poorwhose greed is boundless; the heart being content who is rich and who is poor.

 55. Fruits for meal, sweet water for drink, the (bare) surface of the earth for a bed, and barks for raimnent, are all good (preferable) enough; but I cannot tolerate (lit. sanction) the impudence of wicked men, all those senses. have been maddened by the fresh (acquisition of) wealth as if by drinking wine.

 56. We live on alms, cover ourselves with the directions serving as garments, and lie down on the surface of the earth: what have we to do with big folks?

 57. Of what value, indeed, are we in royal place since we are neither actors, nor flatterers, nor singers; nor have we our hearts set on hating others; nor are we (beautiful) women bent down with the burden of the breasts?

 58. The world was formerly created by certain large–hearted blessed persons; by some it was sustained, and by others it was conquered and given away as if it were grass; other noble persons even now rule the fourteen worlds. What morbid infatuation is it on the part of men when they have acquired rulership over a few towns?

 59. What honour is it to kings to obtain (the rulership of) the earth, which was not left unenjoyed even for a moment by hundreds of kings; but the lords of a part of its (earth's) part, and of even a small part of that part—fools that they are—rejoice when on the contrary they ought to grieve ! !



 60. The clod of earth is encircled by the watery edge. Even when taken as a whole, it is indeed very small; and it is apportioned by a number of kings and enjoyed after hundreds of battles. Abject and exceedingly poor, they therefore, give or would give nothing. Fie upon those mean fellows who wish to get even from them a piece of coin.

 61. He (lit. that singularly fortunate person) alone was born whose white skull was, by the enemy of the God of Love, held prominently on his head as an ornament; (and yet) what height of morbid presumption is there on the part of men when a few persons solicitous of saving their own lives bow to them.

 62. Alas! (my) heart, why dost thou enter the dense. mass of misery (suffer much distress) in order to please the hearts of others by daily propitiation when with the powers of the *Chintamani * spontaneously rising in thee, thou art inwardly satisfied, what object of thine foregonedesire will not satisfy?

 63. Why do you wander for nothing, oh mind? Rest yourself somewhere. A thing that naturally (lit. of itself) takes a particular course does take it; it changes. not. Without, therefore, remembering what is past, or speculating about what is to come, do you in this world experience fruits, the coming and going of which cannot be determined beforehand.

 64. Now he pleased, O heart; cease from these trouble some abyss of sensual objects; resort to the path of final beatitude which is capable of removing, in a moment, all misery; assume a peaceful attitude, give up your course unsteady like a

wave

and never again be attached to transient worldly happiness.

 65. O my mind sweep off infatuation, acquire that devotion to the moon-crested god (which grants the highest



 77. In this world in which life extends over a few winkings of the eye, we do not know what to do, whether we should taste nectarious juice of diverse kinds of poetry, or drink the streams of philosophy; whether we should modestly lead a householder's life in company with a wife ennobled by virtues; or whether we should dwell on the banks of the heavenly river, practising penance.

 78. These kings whose minds are as unteady as a horse are difficult to be propitiated: while we have a high ambition and our heart is set on a lofty position, old age despoils the body and death robs (one) of the dearly loved existence: (under these circumstances), O friend, there is nothing advantageons to a wise man in this world. except penance.

 79. Pride heing on the decline, fortune being dissipated, the mendicant having gone without gaining his object, the relations having diminished in number, attendants. having gone away, and youth having gradually died out, only one thing (lit. only this) is proper for the wise viz. a habitation somewhere in a brake in a cavern of the mountain, the rocks of which are purified by the waters. of the Ganges.

 80. Delightful are the moon-beams, the forest spot. verdant with grass, the happiness arising from the company of the good and of friends is gratifying; the narratives in poetic works are pleasing; charming is the beloved shining with the tears deposited on it by anger; everything is charming; but nothing (is charming) when the mind is distracted. (See notes).

 81. Is there not a delightful mansion for habitation; is not music &c. pleasing to the ear (lit. fit to be heard); is not the happiness of the company of one as dear as) life itself to (a man's) great gratification? But wise men have resorted



 to a forest considering all this as unstable as the shadow of a small lamp flickering in the wind (caused by the wings) of a moth madly falling upon it.

 82. O friend while searching this triple world as far as wordly life prevails, noue such has come within the range of our sight or hearing as can easily become (lit. possesses the facility of becoming) the post for fastening, by means of self-restraint, the elephant of the mind intoxicated by the deep-seated and secret attachment for the female elephant in the form of the sensual objects.

 83. Though reflecting for a long time, I do not know of what great penance this is the result.—viz. this rambling at will, this meal free from humiliation, the company of the noble, this learning having for its fruit (the observance. of) the one vow of controlling the senses, and the mind moving (but) slowly towards external objects.

 84. Desires have already been absorbed (by reasons of non-fulfilment) in the heart; youth has passed away; and alas! in the absence of appreciaters of merit, skill (lit. qualifications) in the (different) limbs has proved fruitless; relentless and powerful death, the all-destroyer, comes suddenly; what is to be done (lit. proper)? Ah I have it; except bearing (resorting to) the two feet of the destroyer of cupid (S'iva) there is no other recourse.

 85. Between Mahesvara, the Lord of the worlds and Janárdana, the Pervading Spirit of the universe, I have no conception of any difference; still I am strongly drawn. to the new-moon-crested God.

 86. On nights with all sounds hushed up, sitting at ease somewhere on the sandy bank of the heavenly river, the surface of which (bank) is whitened by the brilliant flood of moonlight, and grown despondent on account of the wearisomeness (lit. magnitude or expansiveness) of wordly existence, when shall we, loudly uttering the



 the words "Siva, S'iva" have our eyes flooded with copious tears proceeding from supreme bliss !

 87. Having given away everything with a heart full of tender compassion, and remembering the courses of destiny having adverse ends in this wordly existence, (when) shall we pass, in a sacred forest, the nights lit with the rays of the full autumnal moon, the feet of Hara being the sole refuge of our mind !

 88. When shall I wearing a small strip of cloth, and residing in Váránasi (Benares) on the bank of the river. of gods pass my days like a moment crying out "Have mercy, oh Lord, of Gauri, Destroyer of the Three Cities, oh S'ambhu, oh Three-eyed God," having placed on my head my folded palms!

 89. Having bathed in the waters of the Ganges, and worshipped Thee, O Lord, with fruits and flowers undefiled, and having fixed my attention, sitting on a stony couch in the gorge of a mountain, on Thee, the object of contemplation, when shall I, O Enemy of Smara, be free by Thy grace, from the pain of serving a master having hands and feet just like myself, delightfully carrying out the words of the preceptor, living on fruits (only) and selfcomplacent.

 90. O Sambhu, when shall I, living all alone, free from desire and peaceful, and having for my pot my hand (only) and for my garments the quarters, be able to root out*Karma*?

 91. A certain path (i. e. of *Moksha*), easily attainable by the favour of Siva, opens up for the Yogins, who use the hand as a pot, who are contented with alms which are intrinsically pure, who sit anywhere, who ever look upon the world as almost like grass and who have all acquired, even without casting off the body, the knowledge of the uninterrupted and supreme delight (of Brahman).



 92. Happily lives the ascetic (with his) strip of cloth extremely thread bare and torn in a hundred pieces, and a wallet to match, (with his) freedom from care and meal consisting of alms got with ease, (with his) bed in a forest. or a cemetery, (with his) equal regard for friends and foes, with his extremely serene contemplation in a secluded place, and glad that all his errors arising from arrogance have been corrected.

 93. The mere (insignificant) group of worlds is nothing for the temptation of one who has restrained his mind. ever agitation produced in the sen by the motions of a S'afari (a female fish )?

 94. O mother, Lakshmi, repair to some one else: do not yearn for me. We are not hankerers after pleasures. What are you to those (i. e. to us) who are free from desires ? We now wish to live on barley-flour obtained by begging (and placed) in a hollowed vessel of *palása* leaves, stitched together at the moment.

 95. Like a king possessed of by no menus small wealth an ascetic, with ashes profusely besmeared (to his body) and peaceful, sleeps quietly, delighted in the company of the woman viz. indifference (to worldly attachments), the earth( being to him) a delightful bed, his creeper-like arm a spacious pillow, the sky his canopy, the favourable. breeze (or, the breeze, always at his service) his fan, and the moon a brilliant lamp.

 96. There is (rarely found) an ascetic, living on alms, free from attachment (though) in the midst of the people, his movements ever under his control, attached to the path which is free from giving and taking, wearing a wallet made of old threadbare clothes thrown away in the streets, not caring for honour, not proud, and wishing solely for the enjoyment of tranquil pleasure.



 97. Is he a Chándal (pariah) or a Bráhmana (twiceborn), is he a S'adra or an ascetic, or is he some great saint, whose intellect is acute enough to understand philosophical truths: ascetics, although thus spoken of by people, garrulous on account of the doubts rising within them quietly (or, self-deNighted) go their way neither offended nor please at heart.

 98. The creator ordained the air to serve the serpents as food—not involving the sin of destroying life, and assessi ble without any effort; animals living on land be made to eat grass; (but) to men, whose talents are capable of bearing them over the ocean of life, he has assigned such a living that while in pursuit of it all their good qualities are invariably brought to an end (exhausted).

 99. Can those blessed days be (in store) for me, when I, having fixed myself in the *Padmasana* posture on a slab in the Himálayas on the bank of the Ganges, and having gone to the sleep of concentration while in the act. of constantly contemplating Brahman, the old stags (growing) fearless will rub their bodies against mine?

 100. Those blessed ones–whose hand is (to them) a clean pot, and alms acquired by wandering (an) inexhaustible. (supply of) food, to whom the extensive ten quarters are as a spotless garment, and the earth as a spacious bed, whose development is in accepting renunciation, who are contented with themselves, and who have got rid of a number of opportunities of humiliation—root out *Karma.*

 101. O mother, earth; O father, wind; O friend, light; O water, my good relation, and O brother, sky; here do I fold, for the last time, my palms in salutation to you; by means of poor knowledge resulting from the preponderance of merit accumulated by virtue of association with you, all the trammels of infatuation having been removed, I now merge in the Supreme Brahman.



MISCELLANEOUS.

 1. The sun is covered by day with the same strip of*Ambara* (sky; cloth) with which the moon is covered at night: oh the misery of these ! 

 2. When self-restraint developed by discrimination becomes manifest, and when the strong-hold desire has upon man is relaxed, there appears that perfection (the last stage of contemplation) wherein even the lord of gods, becomes an object of pity, wretched (as he is under the influence of desire) on account of the strong distraction caused by the enjoyment of greatness worn out of age.

 3. Learning formerly served to remove the pain (of existence) of those who possessed self-restraint. In course of time it came to be used for securing sensual happiness to sensualists. Seeing that the rulers of the earth are now averse to learning, alas! it is even going down and down every day. 

 4. The time (that was) happy on account of the enjoyment of lovely women is passed; and having, for long, wandered along this avenne of the world we are exhausted; now (stationed) on the bank of the Ganges (lit. the river of heaven) we send forth (lit. extend) with deep sight (the cries of invocation) with the words—S'iva, S'iva, Siva.

 5. Mahadeva is the god, and the stream of the gods. (the Ganges) alone is the stream (for me); caves are (my) abode, and even the quarters (my) raiment; the Destroyer is (to me) as a friend; and my vow—such conduct (as is) free from meanness; or why say more (on this subject), let me be wedded to the *Vata* tree alone (lead a life of seclusion and piety).

 6. How very blessed, indeed, are some persons who with their shackles of worldly ties snapped and not looking out for the irregular course of serpentine



 sensualism, pass, in the farthest corner of a forest, the night, delightful on account of the expanse of the sky being brightened up by the winter moonshine, solely intent on storing up merit.

 7. Our view (at first) was that you were we and we were you (i. e. you and we were the same, and had no diverging interests ); what has happened now by which you are you and we are we (i. e. you and we have had diverging interests)

 8. What is one has a threadbare wallet or a spotless white silken cloth? What if one has only one's wife or is surrounded by a splendid army of horses and elephants? What if delicious food is eaten, or coarse food towards the close of the day? What if there is not the light (of the knowledge of Brahman) manifested inside (i. e. in the heart) or what if there is the glorification in which the fear of worldly existence is destroyed?

 9. When there was ignorance (in us) produced by the influence of the darkness of passion, even the whole world was then looked upon (by us) as consisting of women only; now having applied the collyrium of better judgment, our sight has been restored to its normal state and regards the whole world as Brahman.  

 10. Knowledge in the case of the good does away with conceit, vanity and the like; in the case of others (lit. some) it is the cause of haughtiness and vanity. A secluded place. in the case of self-restraining persons leads to salvation; in the case of love-sick persons it is a further incitement to love.

 11. I consider those men to be supremely rich, who have never joined their palms overhead in token of submission, to whom a slab on some mountain is as a couch and a cave in mountain as a home, to whom the barks of trees are as raiment and the deer as friends, whose subsistence.



 is by the sweet fruits of trees, who find an agreeable beverage in spring water, and to whom learning is as a pleasure-giving consort.

 12. When there is the river of the three worlds, the lustre of whose waist garment touches the head of S'iva, and which with good fruits and with the barks of the trees lining its bank furnishes a splendid living, what wise man is there, who, with the intense pain from the fever of poverty, would face harrowing miseries, if he had no commiseration for his ill-placed family?

 13. Alas! why do wise men live elsewhere, rejecting Kasi where the most rigorous penance (a life of entire abstinence) is (like) varied dinners given in gardens, where a strip of cloth to cover (the body) is decent raiment, where the glory is an unlimited wandering for alms, and where approaching death is like a blessing.

 14. Oh heart, leave those at whose gate (are heard) such replies as "this is not the time for you (to see the master)," "(he is) now in private," "the master is asleep"and "If you were to see him after waiting he would get angry"; and do you go to the temple of the Lord, the ruler of the world, which gives unbounded happiness, which is free from harshness, and where the cruel words of gatekeepers are not heard.

 15. May my days pass in some sacred forest, while muttering the words "Siva, Siva, S'iva" with an eye regarding equally a serpent or a wreath, a powerful enemy or a friend, a gem or a clodof earth, a bed of flowers or a stone, a blade of grass or a group of damsels.

 16. Every thing gives happiness (lit. all directions are full of happiness) to a man who is poor, self-restrained, peaceful, of an equilibrating mini, and ever coutent at heart.



 17. Time never returns; it passes nselessly, a fact which was never considered (by you); (you) accommodated (yourself) to the various conditions, which are adverse on account of the concurrence of a hundred difficulties; or what shall we say? What harm have you not done your- self? Every now and then you have been repeatedly doing the same.

 18. "Arise, my friend, and bear for a moment the heavy burden of my poverty. I am now tired, and shall long enjoy the happiness you enjoyed from death."Thus addressed by a poor man who hai hurri

edto the cemetery, the corpse remained silent, knowing that death was better, far better, than destitution.

 19. These (i. e. women) laugh and cry as suits their purpose; make (others) confide in them, but themselves confide not; therefore a man, possessed of nobility of birth and character, should abandon women as one does jars in a cemetery.

 20. To brutes alone would be dear those fawn-eyed. (women) in whose case faults (demerits) are a recommendation (*lit*. merits) for, their hardness of the breasts, unsteadiness of the eyes, and falsehool on the tongue *(lit*. mouth) are praised; crookedness of hair, dulness of the face, and plumpness of the hips, commended; and timidity of the heart and deceitful tricks towards their beloved (husbands). always mentioned (with approbation).

 21. In some places there is music of the lute, in otherscries of alas! alas!; in some places there is the conversation of learned men, in others the brawls of men intoxicated with drink; in some places there are charming ladies, in others (men or) women with leprous bodies; I do not know whether worldly life is full of sweets or bitters.



 22. Deformed in limbs and lisping in speech, here are you that have been made the buffoon of a farce, while flattering; what part (I do not know) will prolonged life. make you play, such as you are, with your ears bordered with grey hair.

 23. Wealth is evanescent; life is unsteady; and youth in life is fickle; in wordly existence, which is fleeting, merit alone is unchangeable.

 24. That Tortoise alone was born who offered to bearou his back (lit. offered his back for) the heavy burden of the world; the birth of Dhruva (alone) is to be praised, regulated by whom the planetary system revolves; other creatures in the world are, like the insects in an *udumbara* fruit, which possess wings to no purpose, as it were born and dead (simul-  
taneously), since they are not able in any way to do good to others (and since) (both) the present world and the next have become unavailable to them.

 25. Possessed of abuses as you are, you may pour abuses; ay, you may; fot want of them, we are unable to give you abuses; it is known all the world over, that what there is can be given; no one ever gives to another the horn of a hare.

 26. Alms are not unattainable to me in my path line! by rich gardens; the earth is full of fruits, and the skins of deer and the barks of trees (serve as) raiment; with joys or with sorrows, there is in fact the same result. Who willthen give up the three-eyed God, and bow to the men blinded by pride for a particle of wealth?

 27. With a sword we did not cut asander elephants. we did not harass our enemies; \*\*\*\*\* we did not sip the noisy water of the streamlets of the Himalayas; we passed. our time like crows desirous of obtaining a morsel from others.

 \[Extra S1. in the foot-notes—By you Bali was not liberated from the nether world; death was not done away



 with; the dark spot on the Moon was not wiped away, nor were diseases rooted out; nor was S'esha's burden lightened (by you) for a moment by supporting the Earth. O heart, you suffer torment day and night by the false pride of being good.\]

 28. My mind desires to go to S'amkara, its scruples in the investigation of scriptural meaning being completely set at rest, its delight in poetry full of various sentiments being turned away, and all the different wild doubts (lit. expanse of doubts) being totally dispelled.

 29. What if (you have) excellent rice, or a coarse meal at the close of the day? What if (you have) a strip of cloth or a long white garment? What if (you have) one wife or a number of them endowed with a hundred qualities? And what if you wander all alone, or are surrounded by hundreds of elephants and horses?

 30 Charity is a cow that yields all desires; a wallet. protects from cold; (my) devotion to S'iva is firm; what then is the use of riches?

 31. An ascetic, though he has abandoned all desires, lies down on the ground like a king, having the Earth for his couch, his creeper-like arm for a pillow, the sky for canopy and the Moon for his lamp, experiencing pleasure in his union with the woman called Renunciation, and fanned from all sides by the attendant maids—the quarters, with their chowries—the winds.

 32. Tell me, O deer, where you performed penance and of what name, that (by virtue of it) you have never to see the face of the rich or to tell lying flatteries; you do not hear their haughty words, nor run to them with some expectation, but you eat tender grass when it is time (to eat) and lie down at ease when sleep comes (to your eyes).

 33. O brate, how many times and what preparationsof yours, desirous of drinking of the water of the ocean of



 mirage in the form of wealth, have not been baffled? (Very often they have been). Yet your hope is not dispelled; your heart must certainly be formed of adamantine stone, since it has not yet been broken into a hundred pieces.

 34. What is it that lovely-eyed (women) do not do? Having entered the affectionate heart of men they fascinate them, madden them, mock them, despise them, gladden them and cause grief to them.

 35. A lion, strong and living on the flesh of elephants and hogs, ruts, it is said, once in a year. The dove, eating only hard pebbles, ruts daily. Say what the cause here is.

 36. Residence in a sacred forest, and, O joy, association with the deer, sacred maintenance on fruits, stones for couches on the bank of every river—such are the materials for those that like devotion to God. To those whose minds are fixed on renunciation alone, whether (they live in) a house or a forest, it is all the same.

 37. We are quite content with those delicious syllables. (utterances) sweeter than honey or clarified butter which the Divine speech (the Upanishads) sends forth from its ambrosial and immortal body; as long as there is, under our arm, a quantity of barley–meal procured by begging for our maintenance, so long we do not wish to live on wealth acquired by servitude.

 38. A dog, lean, blind of an eye, lame, crop-eared and tail–less (through disease), suffering from abscesses, clammed with pus, and with his body covered with hundreds of worms, exhausted through starvation, decayed with age, and having the brim of an earthen jar placed round its neck, follows a bitch. **** *Madana* scruples not to smite even one that has already been smitten.

 39. Desist, O wise men, from associating with women—from the momentary happiness. Be attached to Mercy, Friendship and Reason. Neither the fully-developed orbs of breasts covered with a wreath, nor the



 round hips having a tinkling girdle round them set with diamonds, can be your salvation in hell.

 40. Why are those suggestive glances, O young women, darted from your sportively half-closed (eyes)? Desist, Oh, desist; vain is this effort (of yours). Now changed beings are we; youth is gone; our yearning (is only) for the farthest part of a forest; infatuation has subsided, and we look upon the meshes of the world. as straw.

 41. This young woman constantly darts towards me her eye that steals the beauty of the blue lotus-leaf, What is designed by her? Our infatnation is gone; the feverish flame produced by the' striking of the flowery arrows of the God of love has been blown out; and yet the poor girl persists !

 42. Why do you, O God of love, trouble your hand with the twangings of your bow? Why do you, O Cuckoo, chatter ineffectually with your soft and sweet notes ? O young woman, enongh of your glances, affectionate, artful, charming, sweet and unsteady; our heart has tasted the nectar-like contemplation of the Moon-crested God.

 48. If you do not want to be engulfed in the ocean of worldly existence, then leave at a distance this river in the form of a woman, having about (the banks) cruel monsters in the shape of cruel thoughts, encircled by the waves of the three furrows on the belly, having a pair of*chakravaka* birds on their wing in the form of two high and plump breasts, and decked with a lotus in the shape of the face.

 44. By the five senses, clever in ministering to their own advantage, which have marred supreme bliss, have I been duped, being revolved (among their objects) thus—Here is melodious music, here a dance, these are sweet flavoured viands, here is a spreading perfume, and here the touch of breasts.

 SI. 1. The poet begins with a salutation to Brahman, the *Supreme Ens*, which is one of the three modes prescribed for the opening of a poem by Sanskrt writers on Poetics, viz. आशीर्मनमस्क्रिया वस्तुनिर्देशो वापि [तन्तुखम्](#Dandin,%20Kavyadars'a.%201. "Dandin, Kavyadars'a. 1.")—A blessing (to be conferred on the readers), a salutation (to the favourite Deity) and an indication of the subject matter are the three prescribed forms of introduction to a poem. It is also usual with Sanskrt writers to have what is technically called. *Mangalácharaña.* This is done either directly by an appeal to the favourite deity itself or to some of its attributes, or by the use of some such word as अथand the like. The efficacy of this *Mangala* is emphasised by all kinds of writers; see Patañ. quoted in the com.

 The Vedantic character of the s'1. the student will easily mark. दिक्काल—space and time, अवच्छिन्न is lit. what is cut off from all sides, is contained in another, is measured: अनवच्छिन्न means what is unmeasured; hence undefined, unconditioned. आदिrefers to qualities (*gunas*) such as , धर्म, अधर्म, &c., as well as to कार्य (effects) &c. न विद्यते अन्तः यस्य तदनन्तं Infinite. चिन्मात्रमूर्ति—चिन्मात्र pure intelligence or knowledge.A Karm. of the मयूरव्यंसकादि class मूर्तिः–whose form is pure intelligence, दिक्का ०ये—A *Tripada* Karm. This is the best way of taking the Comp. The attributes of Bramha, here expressed, are summed up in the *mahbuakya—*'सत्यं ज्ञानमनन्त ब्रह्म'? of the Taittiriya Upanishad. Another way is to analyse. the Comp. as a Bah. with मूर्तिas the second member, with all that precedes as its attributive member, itself being a Comp. of three adjectives. मूर्ति is derived from मूर्च्छ्1. P. to settle into a solid form x क्तिन्and literally means what is visible to the senses.henee secondarily what is perceptible



 by the mind. The Dat. sing, of *nou*. adjs. ending inइis optionaly formed like that of *mas*. nouns; so–मूर्तयेor र्तिने.see Gr. §69. Pán. VII.I. 74.

 स्वानुभूति &c.–स्वानुभूति-self-perception, manifestation of Brahma in contemplation. एकmeans 'principal, chief,' rather than 'sole;' of the couplet. एकोल्पार्थे प्रधाने च &c. quoted in Gr. § 154; also Amars 'एकेमुखयन्यकेवलाः'। मान—मीयतेऽनेनेति मानम्from मा+ल्युट् (अन्), a measure; hence the means of arriving at correct knowledge. In this sense the word प्रमाण is more common. The *pramánas,* according to the Vedantins, areप्रत्यक्षानुमानागमाः प्रमाणानि to which the Naiyayikas add उपमानBrahma is specially regarded as प्रत्यक्षप्रमाणगम्य‘capable of being realised by perception, although there are other means. of knowing it such as आगम्&c. Another reading here isस्वानुभूत्येकसारायwhich Mr. Telang interpretes in two ways:–(1) to him who is the sole essence of self-knowledge, or (2) to him whose sole (or principal) essence is self-knowledge, preferring the former, as that, he thinks, gives the अद्वैतview of the Vedánta.

 शान्ताय &c.—The Dat. by नमःस्वस्तिस्वाहास्वधालंवषड्योगाच 'Pán. II. 3. 16. शान्तं is one of the attributes of Brahma; *cf.*the Sruti
‘निष्कलं निष्क्रियं शान्तं निरवद्यं निरंञ्जनम्।' तेजसे—refers to Brahma and not to the third element. Brahma is often called परं ज्योतिः in the Upanishads Comp. एष संप्रसादः..........परं ज्योतिरुपसम्पद्य &c. Chhándogya, also the S'ruti तद्देवाज्योतिषां ज्योतिः (उपासते). For the ides comp. Panchadasi, quoted in the com.

 "For the idea may be compared Geography

Nyssen's description.of the divine nature quoted by the late Mr. Mansel in his philosophy of the conditioned (p. 16):— It is neither in place nor in time, but before these and above these in an unspeakable manner, contemplated itself by itself through faith alone, neither measured by ages, nor moving alone with times."

 S'I. 2. The present S'loka is said by; the Commentators (whose remarks are perhaps based on a tradition which is almost universal) to refer to a family intrigue the incidental



 discovery of which filled Bhartṛhari with disgust for worldly life. It is this:–Once upon a time, a [Bráhmaņa](#According%20to%20another%20version%20king%20Vikrama%20obtained%20the%20fruit%20from%20a%20Yogin,%20he%20gave%20it%20to%20a%20Bråhmana,%20he%20to%20Bhartrhari%20and%20so%20on. "According to another version king Vikrama obtained the fruit from a Yogin, he gave it to a Bråhmana, he to Bhartrhari and so on."), who had come by a fruit which conferred immortality on any one who ate, it, gave it to Bhartrhari, as the worthiest person to receive it, being the protector of many people. Bhartrhari gave it to his wife who gave it to her paramour, who in his turn gave it to a sweet-heart of his, who again presented it to Bhartṛhari. The s'loka, however, is quite out of place here as it has no connection with any things that follow. If it be supposed that it is the expression of the abhorrence of the intrigues and sins of the world felt by some one disgusted with it, then the most natural place for it would be the*Vairágyas'ataka.* Many manuscripts, however,agree in giving it here.

 चिन्तयामि—Think with affectionate regard or love. मयि अविरक्ता. Words implying love, attachment (or disattachment) &c, govern the Loc. of the person or thing for whom or which the feeling is shown. Mr. Telang considers the Loc. to be वैषयिक being equivalent to मद्विषयकानुरागवती अन्यसक्तः—अन्यस्यां सक्तः attached or devoted to. अन्या become अन्य i e assumes by the Várt. सर्वनाम्नः वृत्तिमात्रे(in Samasa and the other Vṛttis) पुंवद्भावः See Malli, on अनन्यभाजं पतिमाप्नुहीति &c. Kum. III. 63.

 कृते—For, for the sake of (*Indec*) is often compounded as here. *Cf. काव्यं यशसेर्थकृते*&c. Káv. P. I. when not compounded it governs the Gen.; अमीषां प्राणानांकृते Vair. S'at. 36.परिशुष्यति—pines for, feels ardent love for. This reading is evidently preferable (as Mr. Telang also thinks) to परितुष्यति which may be best rendered as "delighted with all I do."

 धिक्—is used with the Acc मदन—from मद् (माद्यत्यनेन) + अन Lit. the intoxicating god.च इमाम् —The hiatus here is allowed by the rule संहितैकपदे &c. Sid. Kau.; see com.—*Sandhi* is absolutely necessary in a grammatical form, in the case of a



 preposition and a root, as also in compounds; but in composition it depends on the will of the writer. Rhetoricians, however, consider it a fault called 'विसंधिदोष'See Kåv. P. VII.  
 SI. 3. अज्ञ—जानातीति ज्ञः (ज्ञा+ कृ) न ज्ञः अज्ञः। सुखं सुखतर used as adverbs विशेषं जानातीति विशेषज्ञः। ज्ञानलव०—लव m. is derived from to out, to divide; a particle. दुर्विदग्ध–विदग्ध properly means what is well burnt, polished and burnished; hence refined with culture, learned; दुष्टं यथा विदग्धः दुर्विदग्ध badly learned or wise, vain, arrogant (with little learning; ज्ञानलवेन दुर्विदग्धः) दुर्विदग्धो दुश्चतुरः अर्धज्वलित इत्यर्थः।Rámarshi. *Cf.*Little knowledge is a dangerous thing. ब्रह्म–derived fr. वृह् 1. 6. P. to grow+ मनिन,theऋ being changed to र् before it by Uņ. IV. 145. रञ्जयति—रञ्ज् Cau, means to colour, to impart one's hue to; hence to win over, to gratify or propitiate. The Can, form is रञ्जयति when the meaning is to sport with or hunt deer; see Kir. VI, 24. Some read the line as ब्रह्मापि तं नरं&c. but this violates the laws of metre (as it makes 17 *mátrás* in Påda instead of 15 or 18 ) and is therefore inadmissible.

 ŚI. 4. प्रसह्य—Indec.. with great force. from. मणिfrom मण् sound + इ (न्). मकर०–मंविषं किरतीति (क+अचू) a crocodile, s shark. वक्त्र—वक्स्यनेनेति from वच् + ट्रन् करणे. द्रष्ट्रा–also der with ष्ट्रन् from दंश्to bite.०—अङ्कुर *V.l.—*from अङ्क्a to mark, stamp+उरच्means pointed, sharp दंष्ट्राङ्कुरात्—from the tips or points (i. e. when held fast between the points) of the jaws; sing. for pl. *Cf.*दर्भाङ्कुरS'âk. and दीपाङ्कुरःVair. S'at. 63.प्रचलद०—ruffled or agitated with a series of rolling billows. उर्मि
m. f. from ऋ+ मि, अर्तेरुञ्चs Uṇ. IV. 44.  
 भुजङ्गः—भुजः (bent, curved कुटिलीभवन) सन् गच्छतीति भुज् + मुम्+खच् मुम् (the nasal) inserted by 'णरुर्द्विषदजन्तस्य मुम्' Pán. VI. 3. 67—Before the aff. खश्and the words अरुम्, द्विषत् and such as end in अtake the aug. म् when used prepositionally with verbs. पुष्पवत्—पुष्पेण तुल्यम् like a flower तेन तुल्यं क्रिया चेद्वतिः Pán. V. I. 15. वत् is attached to a noun in the sense of तेन तुल्यं 'equally with that' when the equality refers



 to an act. प्रतिनिविष्ट—obstination, holding contrary opinions, perverse, *Cf.*निविशतेVair. S'at. Mis. s'l. 19.

 SI. 5. सिकतासु—The word सिकताis always used in the plural. यत्नतः–यत् + नङ् (भावे). तम्here stands for the Instr मृगतृष्णा एवं मृगतृष्णिका by adding के स्वार्थेmirage. It is a phenomenon observed in sandy tracts or deserts when the floating vapour or air is heated by the tropical sun and presents the appearance of water. It is so called because it attracts and deceives the deer and other animals. सिकता–सुतैलं excellent oil &c मृगतृष्णिका–सुसलिलं sweet water–may also be regarded as compound words. This way of taking the expression is perhaps better as it adds to the force of the argument, and avoids प्र

क्रमभङ्ग. It does not, however, look natural. सलिल—सलति गच्छतीति, सल्+इलच्. *Cf* the *Subhashita* एष बन्ध्यासुतो याति खपुष्पकृतशेखरः। मृगतृष्णाम्भसि स्नातः शशशृङ्गधनुर्धरः॥wherein all the things generally spoken as absolute impossibilities are brought together. Some discover in this s'l. the fault *yatibhanga* or wrong

Cresura; see com.

 S'I. 6. व्याल—A wild elephant. Some take it to mean 's serpent' but without property, as it considerably impairs the force of the argument. Besides, a serpent is not known to be tied down while an elephant always is; cf. sl. 17. रोद्धुम्—To tie down. For the inf. see Apte's G. § 176 and note. वालमृणाल०—मृणालis m. n. तन्तु is from तन्+ तुन् समुज्जृम्भते—has a metaphorical meaning here; strives, makes efforts. वज्जमणि—a diamond. प्रान्तः—

मकटोन्तः—extreme edge. शिरीष is known to be the softent flower. This shows the extreme folly of the act. सन्नह्यते—prepares, makes himself ready for. It properly means to put on an armour and thus to equip one's self for battle; cfMah. Bhár. युद्धाय सन्नह्यते It is Atm. in this sense. पथि—The root नीgoverns two objects and the Acc. would have been more idiomatio. But as पथिis not the principal object but only secondary, it depends upon the will of the speaker to put it in the Acc. or



 in its natural case. सुधास्यन्दिभिः—shedding nectar, mellifluous. The root is sometimes used transitively. Cf. हलाहलं खलु पिपासति कौतुकेन कालानलं परिचुचुम्बिषति प्रकामम्। व्यालाधिपं च यतते परिरब्धुमद्धा यो दुर्जनं दशयितुं कुरुते मनीषाम्। Bhẩm. Vil. I. 93; also 96, where the idea is somewhat differently expressed.

 The rhetorical fig. here is *Nidars'aná* (मालानिद०which is defined as–निदर्शना। 'अभवन्वस्तुसम्बन्ध उपमापरिकल्पकः॥' when an impossible connection of things implies a comparison it is निदर्शनं दृष्टान्तकरणम्(citing of an instance). We have here a*M'alanidars'aná* (a string of illustrations ) as the u*pamanas* or'things compared' to are many.

 S1.7. स्वायत्तम्—at one's command, within one's control. एकान्तगुणं—एकान्तः always leading to one result; hence, never failing in its effect. With this sense cf.'एकान्तविध्वंसिषुवद्धिधाना Rag. II. 57. गुण—efficacy, advantage. अपण्डिताः—पण्डा acuteintellect, learning; see com.; Nañ. Tat.

 S1. 8. किचिज्ज्ञ—Knowing a little *cf* ज्ञानलव० śl. 3.*supra.* Mr. Telang separates यदा अकिञ्चिज्ज्ञ to mark distinctly,. as he says, the contrast with the third line. But this hardly improves the sense. A man is likely to be puffed up with little knowledge, not with great knowledge. द्विप—द्वाभ्यां with two (i. e. the mouth and the trunk), पिबतीति—an elephant. किचित्किंचित्—When I knew something (of reality) every day. The repetition of किंचित् shows continuous increase of know- ledge, the continuity of action being one of the senses of

वीप्साor repetition. मद्—mark the double meaning of this word here, (1) rut. (2) vanity, arrogance.

 S1. 9. कृमि—Covered with, or full of a swarm of insects. विगन्धि— giving out a bad stench. This is grammatically. inaccurate विरुद्ध गन्धः अस्य givesविगन्धम् So to explain the form we must add इच्मत्वर्थे विरुद्ध गन्धः विगन्धः Karm. सोस्त्यस्य. But this is against the rule न कर्मधारयान्मत्वर्थीयः बहुव्रीहिश्वेत्तदर्थेप्रतिपत्तिकरः।No affix showing possession should be added to a Karm, if its sense can be conveyed by a Bab. So this way



 of defending the form is not very satisfactory. See, however, our note on तुल्यगन्धिषु Rag. IV. 45. जुगुप्सित—censured, condemned. निरुपम्— Avya.; रसप्रीत्या v. l. see com.; (eating it) with a relish the flavour of which is unparalled. न शङ्कते—has no fear or misgiving; does not think that he is doing something censurable or disgusting. परिग्रहफल्गुता—the worthlessness of one's belonging. The fig. here is अर्थान्तरन्यास—Def. सामान्यं वा विशेषो वा तदन्येन समर्थ्यते। यत्र सोर्थान्तरन्यासः साधर्म्येणितरेण Where a particular proposition is corroborate by a general proposition or a general proposition is supported by a particular instance either under a resemblance or contrast, that is *Arthántaranyása* or corroboration. There is also अप्रस्तुतप्रशंसा in the first three lines.  

 Ś1. 10.सार्वम्–शर्वस्येदं of Siva. Bhagirath, a king of the solar race, wishing to procure the salvation of his 60,000 ancestors that had been reduced to ashes by Kapila's curse, propitiated by his penance, Ganga, and induced her to come down to the earth. The river complied with his request but directed him to find out some one who would bear her force as she would fall down from heaven. Bhagiratha then propitiated S'iva who agreed to allow the river to fall on his head. Bhagirathi, accordingly, fell from heaven on Siva's head, thence descended to the peak of Himálaya, thence to the earth and thence to the nether world where her waters sanctified the offspring of Sagara. The whole story is given in RámaI.35-44. For पशुपति some read पतति शिरसः तत्क्षितिधरम् (his i.eSiva's mountain ) महीघ्र—महीं धरतीति धृक्+ क (अ) a mountain. अघोधः—The Ganges comes down to a lower and lower position. स्तोक—low, base.अथवा— or ra ther, what wonder if. far-Gangá, in her arrogance thought that she would bear down even S'iva and enter into the nether world with him; she was punished for this by Siva, See Rám. विनिपातः—Mark the *double entendre* on this word which means (i) great fall, and (ii) destruction, ruin. शतमुख-applies to



 the river in its literal sense; in the other case it means, in a hundred ways.' The fig. is *Arthántaranyása.*

 SI11. हुतभुक्—हुतं भुंक्ते (aff. किम्) fire. सूर्य—सरति आकाशे यद्वासुवति कर्मणि लोकं प्रेरयति (urges men to action) इति See Sid Kau on Pàn. III, 1. 114. नाग—न गच्छतीति अगः न नागः यद्वानगे भवः ।नागेषु इन्द्रः श्रेष्ठः यद्वा नागोयामिन्द्र इव upmita samása.

 निशित—p. p. of शो to sharpen; also शात मन्त्रप्रयोगः—मन्त्र is a spell, a charm. प्रयोग is its employment for practical purposes. विष—is m. and new. ओषधः—from ओषधी+अण्medicine.ओषः पाकः धीयते अस्यामिति औषधिः। विहित prescribed or laid down in the S'ástras. मुर्खस्य &c—i. e. for his folly.  
 SI. 12. साहित्य—The best way is to take the Comp. as consisting of threethings vi साहित्य (सहितस्य भावः व्यञ्) poetic compositions, सङ्गीत music and फला or arts. See com. जीवमानः—The verb जीव् is not Atm. and so the pre. p. ought to be जीवत्. But the form is defended by the following rule of Pán. ताच्छील्यवयोवचनशक्तिषु चानश्. The term आन (चानश् and not शानच्) is applied to a root when it implies habit, age or power; भोगं भुञ्जानः(habit), कवचं विभ्राणः(age, a young man),शत्रुन् निघ्नानः(power). जीवमानः may, therefore, mean 'accustomed to live'(ताच्छील्य); living. भागधेय–भाग एव भागधेयें Good luck. धेय is added to रूप, नाम and भाग स्वार्थे i. e.without any alteration of sense.  
 SI. 13. ज्ञानम्—may here refer to knowledge of the self, or higher knowledge. गुणः-—Such a courage, generosity of mind &c. धर्मः—discharge of duty or religious merit. भुवि सारभुता—a burden to the earth. मर्त्यलोके In this world of mortals—should be construed with चरन्ति.  
 मनुष्यरूपेण &c.—The fig. here is *Apahnuti*'प्रकृतं यन्निषिभ्यान्यत्स्थाप्यते सात्वपह्युतिः'where the real thing (the matter in hand, the उपमेय ) is denied and some thing unreal (the उपमान)is affirmed in its place, is *Apahnuti. of,*विद्याविहीनः पशुःŚl. 20.

 SI. 14. पर्वत–fr(पर्वन् a joint, a part). दुर्ग—the impassable place. भ्रान्तम् p. p. used as a noun; for a similar use of गतं



 (gait) तिरश्वीनमनुसारथेः Sis. I. 2. उभावलंचक्रतुरञ्चिताभ्यां तपोवनावृत्तिपथं गताभ्याम् Rag. II. 18. सुर—The derivation of this word is far fetched. सुष्टु राति इति सुरः he who grants what is desired, याद्वा समुद्रोत्थासुरा (nectar churned ont of the sea) अस्स्यस्य; अर्श-आदित्वात् अच्Pān. V. 2 127 ef. Râmâ. सुरापरिग्रहाद्देवाः सुरा इत्य भिविश्रुताः ।The word, however, is of later growth, the original word being असुर from which it was derived. See note on असुर Rag. II. 37.  
 SI.15. शास्त्रोपस्कृत—शास्त्रैः (such as grammar, rhetoric &o.) उपस्कृताः (refined, polished) ये शब्दाः तैः सुन्दरा agreeable, eharming गीः येषाम्। उपस्कृत–उपात्मप्रतियत्नवैकृतवाक्याध्याहारेषु च\। Pán. VI. 1. 139. उपात्कृञः सुट् स्यादेषु अर्थेषु द्योत्येषु–स् is inserted betweenउप and कृ when these senses are to be implied; चात्मागुक्तयोरर्थयोः—by च we ought to understand that स् is inserted to express the senses already given (i.eभूषणे समवाये च Pän V.I. 1. 137 138). प्रतियत्नोगुणाधानं adding & property or excellence; विकृतमेव वैकृतं विकारः; वाक्यस्य अध्याहारः आकाङ्क्षितैकदेशपूरणम् ।उपस्कृता कन्या अलंकृता इत्यर्थः। This sense will do in the present case; उपस्कृता ब्राह्मणाः समुदिताः (collected together) इत्यर्थः। एधो दकस्योपस्कुरुते गुणाधानं करोतीत्यर्थः। उपस्कृतं भुंक्त विकृतमित्यर्थैःउपस्कृतं ब्रूते। वा- क्याध्याहारेण ब्रूते।Sid Kau. This last sense will also do—whose speeches are embellished with quotations from the different*Sástras.*

 शिष्यप्रदेयागमाः–आगम properly means the Vedas, but here it means literary acquirements, knowledge of the different branches of learning क—a learned man साङ्गं—stupidity, insbility to appreciate the merits of. ईश्वरः–ईशितुं शीलमस्य; from ईश्+ वरच्'स्थेशभासपिसकसो वरच्' Pán. III. 2. 175. These roots take this aff. ताच्छील्ये; स्वावर, भास्वर, पेस्वर &o. ईश्वर means 'rich' here. *Cf-*'मा प्रयच्छेश्वरे धनम्' H. I. कुत्स्याः—from कुत्स10 A to censure, fit to be censured, fit to blame अर्पतः पासिताः-Valued lower than their real worth. The fig. in the first three lines is विरोधाभास in as much as the poets are spoken of as ईश्वर, though without wealth, which apparent Virodha or incongruity is removed by taking



 ईश्वर to mean rich in the store of knowledge. The fig. in the last line is दृष्टान्त.

 S1.16 गोचरम्—गावः चरन्ति यस्मिन् over which the eyes (गो=eye) move, hence visible to; it generally means 'within the scope of (गो meaning an *indriya*); it also means pasturage, where गोmeans a cow. The word is irregularly. formed by गोचरसंचर&c. Pân III. 3. 119. किमपि indescribable.. पुष्णाति—पुष् here means to bring about.' Cf. for this sense किमभिलषितं पुष्यति न ते Vair. S'at. 34. The word very often. occurs in S'âkuntala. कल्पान्तेषु—कल्पis a day of Brahmå equal in duration to the four *Yugas* (4,320,000 years) rolling on 1000 times, which also measures the duration of creation. Vidya is not destroyed like every other thing at the end of a*Kalpa* *Cf* for the ides विद्या कुलजवधूरिव जहाति नो जन्म जन्मापि।and Kum. I. 30; also न चोरहार्यंन च राजहायै न भ्रातृभाज्यं न च भारकारि। व्यये कृते वर्धत एवं नित्यं विद्याधनं सर्वधनप्रधानम्॥ Subha. तान् प्रति &o.–Give up your pride or sense of personal greatness towards them i. e. act with courtesy and humility towards them. तैः सह—स्पर्ध्is used with the Inst ef. 'अस्पर्धिष्ट च रामेण' Bk. XV. 65. The fig.s are व्यतिरेक and विरोधाभास (in the 2nd 1.).

 S1. 17. परमार्थ—the highest object to be aimed at the highest truth i. e. Knowledge about Brahma or the Surpreme Spirit. पण्डित—sees'1. 7. लघुलक्ष्मीः—Wealth that insignificant thing (like grass). The contrast is betweeen परमार्थand तृणमिव लघुलक्ष्मी. वारणम्—a hindrance.

 S1. 18. The idea expressed in the s'l. is this—A king, even though angry with a learned man, can at the most deprive him of his external comforts but do him no further injury—he cannot deprive him of his great inherent virtues अम्भोजिनी०—वनं a bed. नितराम् may mean 'wholly, entirely,' if taken with हन्ति or 'exceedingly, very much,' when taken with कुपित. दुग्धजलभेद—The power of separating milk from water is supposed to belong to all swans. *Cf.* सारं ततो ग्राह्यमपास्य फाल्गु हंसैर्यंथा क्षीरमिवाम्बुमध्यात्। Pan, Tan.I. नीरक्षीरविवेके हंसालस्यं त्वमेव तनुषे चेत्। विश्वस्मिन्नधुनान्यः



 कुलव्रतंपालयिष्यति कः॥ Bhām Vil. I. 12. वैदग्ध्य—विदग्धस्य भावःI See note on दुर्विदग्ध s'l. 3. The word is used here in the sense of 'natural skill or capaoity'. कृस्यवस्तुषु चातुर्ये वैदग्ध्यं परिकीर्त्यते।

 Śl. 19. केयुरः—an armlet.संस्कृताः—-polished or refined by oulture. Cf. Kali. 'संस्कारवत्येव गिरा मनीषी तथा स पुतश्व विभूषितश्वKum, I. 28, where Malli, renders the word संस्कारby व्यकरण–जन्या शुद्धिः।Here of course the word means more than that सतत—Lasting for ever.

 S1. 20. नाम—is used here प्राकाश्ये ‘as is well known'; or it may have the sense of ‘indeed, verily' as in मया नाम जितंor न नाम शरासनम्Vik. प्रच्छन्नगुप्त—The Comp. may be taken in two ways प्रच्छन्नं यथा तथा गुप्तंvery carefully protected, or प्रच्छन्नमत एव गुप्तं चcarefully concealed (from view and protected) *Cf.*हर्तुर्याति न गोचरं*supra* s'1. 16. भोगकरी—contributing to pleasures. from भोग+कृ+टः (अ) added हेती+हे see com., टis attached to कृ in these senses:–यशस्करी विद्या, श्राद्धकरः (ताच्छील्य), वचनकरः (आनुलोभ्य); Sid. Kau. गुरुणां गुरुः the preceptor of preceptora, or the greatest of the great. For the Gen. गुरुणां see Pån II. 3. 41. (यतश्च निर्धारणम्)and Apto's G. § 82.

Past. p. participles ending in त, when used in the sense of the present tense, are used with the Gen. राज्ञां मतः बुद्धः पुजितो वाThe Loc. may be explained. as विषयाधिकरणे, राजसु विषये पूजिता or the whole may be taken as a Comp. word meaning well (सु) respected (पुजिता) by kings (राजभिः). विद्याविहीन पशुः—Comp. s' 1s 12, 13.

 Fig.— As there are many *rupakas* in this s'I. the figure of speech is *Mälä-rupaka*. A रुपक is defined as तद्रूपकमभेदो यः उपमानोपमेययोः—the identity of the उपमान and उपमेय is *Rüpaka*



 i. e. when two things known to be quite different from each other are identified together to show their great resemblance to each other the fig is *Rüpaka.*

 SI. 21. क्षान्तिश्चेत्—cf. क्षमाशस्त्रं करे यस्य दुर्जनः किं करिष्यति। कवचेन is undoubtedly a better reading. The other reading वचनेन means 'why need conciliatory words' ie these sre super- fluous. क्रोधः—Anger itself is a great enemy as it causes much restlessness and worry to aman. ज्ञाति &c.—Because the*dáyādas* are a fire that internally consumes. हृदय becomes इत् after सु or दुर्when the sense is 'a friend or a foe'; (see com.); अन्यत्र सहृदयः दुर्हृदय।Sid Kau. अनवद्या—न अवद्या (न वद्या अवद्या) अनवद्या blameless, commendable and not अभिचारादिविद्या. Mark the difference of meaning between अवद्य and अनुद्य both formed by the aff. य; the former means what is not fit to be spoken, what deserves blame; the latter 'what onght not to be named;'asअवद्यं पापं अनुद्यं गुरुनाम See Kau on Pin III. 1. 101, (अवद्यपण्यवर्या गर्हापणितव्यानिशेधेषु) ब्रीडा—modesty. सुकविता—is used here in the sense of 'good power of composition, poetic genius *Cf.* लोमश्वेदगुणेन किं 81. 55, further on.

The *Rasasa* are more or less a necessary factor of every poetic composition. But according to Vis'vanátha they constitute the very essence of poetry (since he defines काव्य asवाक्यं रसात्मकं काव्यम्). रससिद्ध is also a *S'lishta* word. The side meaning is who are skilled in managing meroury (रस), which, when prepared in a particular way, is supposed to grant exemption from old age. यशःकाये—यशोरुपः कायः।काय irregularly derived from चि; चीयतेऽस्मिन्नस्थ्यादिकमिति, चीयते अन्नादिनति वा कायः। चि+घञ् चस्य कः।Pan III. 3. 41 जरा fr. ज+अङ् *Cf* कतिपयनिमेषवर्तिनि जन्मजरामरणविह्वले जगति। कल्पान्तकोटिबन्धुः स्फुरति कवीनां यशःप्रसरः॥Subha.

Mr. Joglekar takes this in the general sense of 'a noble-minded person',derīving it as शोभनं हृत् यस्य, 'as opposed to असन्तः But I am inclined to take it rather in its restricted sense of ‘a friend' who alone may be appealed to for help under any circumstances, and not every good person. The force of अपि is then properly brought out. The use of the sing. सुहृद् also shows that that is the intention of the poet. Otherwise he should have used the plural corresponding to सन्तः उच्चैः स्थेयम्— Acting nobly, keeping up one's dignity. *Cf*. S'is. IX. 5. पदमनुविधेयं&c.—Tread, follow, in the foot-steps (of the great). उद्दिष्ट—is here used for are advised, dictated. असिधारात्रतम्—Three meanings can be assigned to this:—(1)

The change of अग्रto अग्रेis irregular. केसरिन्—केसरः अस्यास्तीति; as applied to the pollen of flowers, both केसरand are correct; but as applied to the mane of a lion केसर is the only correct form. Hence केसरिन् is the only correct form and not केशरिन् whon meaning & lion (as written in some lexicons).

 S'I. 30 निर्मोस—The word माँस is curiously derived in Manu Sm. V. 55. मांस भक्षयिताऽमुत्र यस्य मांसमिहाद्मयहम्। एतन्मांसस्य मांसत्वं प्रवदन्ति मनीषिणः॥ अस्थिकं—small bone; क in such cases is used in a diminutive sense; it may also have a deprecatory sense here; कुत्सितमस्थि अस्थिकम् Thereading अस्थि गोः has no special propriety here. सिंहः—हिनस्तीति, & word of the पृषोदरादि class: सिंहो वर्णविपर्ययात्।Sid Kau. सत्वानुरूपं worthy of in keeping with, one's greatness or magnanimity of heart

Both the senses seem to be intended. पिण्डद—the giver of food. गजपुङ्गव—पुङ्गव at the end of a Comp. indicates excellence.

An *Anyôkti*(a kind of *Aprastutaprarsamsa).*

 SI. 32. परिवर्तीनि—Rotating, revolving:–an idea that fits in well with *Samsâra* which means ‘that in which the soul passes from one corporeal existence to another, मृतः को वा न जायते—who, indeed, being dead is not born again? This is the sense in which the late Mr. Telang seems to take this passage. But the condition of death must follow that of birth, so it is better to construe it as कः न मृतः को वा न जायते who is not born and who is not dead; birth and death are the necessary conditions through which every one must pass. *Cf.*Bg II. 27. quoted in the com. समुन्नति—elevation, eminence. a rise in status.

 SI. 33. द्वयी—द्वौअवयवौयस्याः; 'two fold' संख्याया अवयवे तयप्।द्वित्रिभ्यां तयस्यायज्वा। Pän V. 2. 42, 48. अय is optionally substituted for तय in the case of द्वि or त्रि; द्वितयं, द्वयं त्रितयं, त्रयम्. मनस्विन्—noble-minded, high souled. द्वे गती स्तःः &o. v. I. means:–There are two courses (of action) for &c. The former is preferable as it implies an amount of consideration and determination on the part of the *Manishin.*&c.—(1) at the head of all; (2) on the head &c. For the idea expressed here comp. नैसर्गिकी सुरभिणः कुसुमस्य सिद्धा मूर्घ्निस्थितिर्नं चरणैरवताडनानि ॥Uttar I विशीर्यत०—A high –minded man rather than occupy a low position retires from society and leads a secluded. life.

 विशेष—see com.; or विशेष्यत इति. विशेषःunusual, uncommon; or शिष्यते इति शेषः।complete, hence uncommon; विशेषः विक्रमः विशेष तत्र रुचिः यस्य bent on performing deeds of unusual valour. वैरायते A denom. from देर meaning वैरं करोति; derived with the aff. क्यङ्; see com. भास्वरौ—brilliant. भान्तः–v.l. revolving; कर्तरि क्तःby गत्यर्थाकर्मक &c. Pan III. 4. 72. पर्वन्—The time of new or full moon (opposition or conjunction). शार्षाव०—The allusion here is to the severance of the demon's head at the time when the nectar that was churned out of the ocean was served to the gods, and Ráhu attempted to drink it by joining their line. The sun and the moon informed Vishnu of the fraud, whereupon he severed the demon's head with his discus. But as the demon had tasted a little quantity of*Amyta* the head lived and is supposed to wreak its vengeance on the two luminaries. See Mat. Pu. Adh. II. 5. 13. 16. Bhâg. P. VIII. 9. 23–26. The fig. is अमस्तुतप्रशंसा as the action of Rahu which is not the matter in hand (अप्रस्तुत) implies the action of an inveterate wicked man which is the matter intended to be described.

 ŚI. 35. फणाफलक The flat surface of (extensive board formed by his hoods. Comp. Mat. Pu. OOLIX. 7. मध्येपृष्ठम्—on the back. Avy. Com. This is less common though by no means very rare: comp. Bv. I. 60; Nai, III. 40; Sis. III. 70.VII. 32 and 70 Bhatti. V. 4. पारे मध्ये षष्ट्या वा। Pan. II. 1. 18. The words पार and मध्य are optionally compounded with a noun in the Gen. case forming an Avy., the final अ of these being irregularly (निपातनात् एदन्तत्वं चानयोर्निपास्य़ते। Sid– Kan.) changed to ए; optionally there may be Gen, Tat. *e. g.*Sid.  
 N. N. 2



 गङ्गापारात्, गङ्गामध्यात् When the last word has the sense of the Loc. the final may be changed to अम् as here, the sense being पृष्ठस्य मध्ये.See Gr.§ 274. क्रीडाधीन—क्रोडेproperly means the bosom (भुजान्तर see Amara. 11. 77.); hence a portion, a corner of the ocean's surface, क्रोडे अधि क्रोडाधीनं Loc. Tat. The Tad. aff. अ(ईन) is necessarily added to a Tat. ending in अधिby Pân. V. 4. 7. अनादरात् with but scanty regard. The ocean seems to take but little notice of the Tortoise with his immense body. For the story, see Mat. Pu. Chap. OOXLIX. 26, 26. अहह expresses here ‘wonder, astonishment,' (अद्भुते). निःसीमानः—न विद्यते सीमा यासां. The *fem*. of निःसीमन्is formed in three ways, so the other forms of the pl. are निःसीमन्and; निःसीमन्य see बहुराजन् Gr. § 329. The fig. in the first three lines is Máladipaka, and in the fourth *arthántaranyasa* (confirming the general proposition about the magnanimity of the actions of the great by the particular instance of the sea).

 SI. 36. मघवन्—Indra. The word bere may beमघवन् or मघवत्; मह्यते पूज्यते इति मघवा or—वान्. The former is derived by 'श्वन्नक्षन्'—Up. I. 159. the latter by 'मघवा बहुलम्' Pân. VI. 4. 128. तुषाराद्रेः सुनुः—Maináka, son of Himálays and Menâ. *Cf.*असुत सा नागवधूपभोग्यं मैनाकमम्भोनिधिबद्धसख्यम्। क्रुद्धेपि पक्षाच्छदि वृत्रशत्राववेदनाज्ञं कुलिशक्षतानाम्Kum. I. 20. Allusion–Formerly the mountains had wings with which they flew about and grew very troublesome. To stop the evil Indra lopped off their wings with his thunderbolt when hundreds of them flew to the

seefor protection. Only Maináka escaped the fate which overtook others. For this legend, see Rámå. Sun. K, Adh. I. 115–119. For the physical explanation, see Notes on Rag. I, 68. Mark the use of the word उचितhere. In the construction of वरम् न च or न पुनः, such a word is not usual, its signification being implied in the construction itself. Mr. Telang's notes.

 ŚI. 37. यत्–तत्— since then; in as much as पादैःस्पृष्टः (1) touched with the rays; (2) with feet. तेजस्वी—of pre-eminent valour. विन् showing excess (भुमन्) (अस्मायामेधाम्नजो विनिःPân. V.

I*which nearly means the same thing. It properly means 'change, agitation;'hence what causes such agitation, offence, injury. Fig. Drštânta.

 ŚI. 38. मदमलिन—मदेन मलिने कपोलभित्तांयेषां तेषु। प्रशस्तौ कपोलो कपोलभित्ती(wall-like), excellent cheeks; the excellence consisting in their breadth or massiveness मतल्लिकोद्धमिश्राः स्युःप्रकाण्ड 'स्थलभित्तयः'

Ganaratnamahodadhi quoted by Malli in his com.on Rag. V. 43. Or this may mean 'the temples and cheeks.'भित्ति properly means a wallfr. भिद्to separate: a wall lseparates two rooms; hence any thing that separates, distinguishes (used at the end of & Karm. Comp.). प्रकृति—'nature,' a permanent trait in one’e character; opp. to विकृति. Comp. sl. 52, last line. Fot the ides comp. Kālidása—तेजसां हि न वयः समीक्ष्यते Rag. XI. 1. and तेजसा सह जातानां वयः कुत्रोपयुज्यते।

 ŚI. 39. जातिर्यातु &c.—The ideaof the sl.is that all these qualities sink into utter insignificance when compared to money. If one has money these are nothing to him. Comp. śl. 41. रसातलं—one of the seven regions below the earth. These are अतल, वितल, सुतल, रसातल तलातल, महातल and पाताल. शील—Virtuous conduct, character. It is a word of constant occurrence in Bhar.; *cf* Slokas 13, 42, 82, 109, &, अभिजनः—nobility of birth. *Cf* Mal M&d. II. 13. Sak IV. 18. शौर्ये वैरिणि—Bravery is said here to be an enemy as it often proves an obstacle to earning money. A brave man can never stoop to such mean acts as it sometimes becomes necessary for a seeker of wealth to perform येनैकेन &c.—This explains why wealth is desired at the cost of जाति &c. and so the fig is Kāvyalinga.

 SI. 40. इन्द्रियाणि—इन्द्रिय is peculiarly derived by Pán (V 2 93.) इन्द्रियमिन्द्र- लिङ्गमिन्द्रदृष्टामिन्द्रसृष्टमिन्द्रजुष्टमिन्द्रदत्तमिति वा॥ इन्द्र is



 the soul, the lord of the body. It is thus explained by Vámanaइन्द्रस्य लिङ्गमिन्द्रियम्। इन्द्र आत्मा स चक्षुरादिना करणेनानुमीयते।नाकर्तृकंकरणमस्ति। इन्द्रेण दृष्टमात्मना दृष्टमित्यर्थः। इन्द्रेण सृष्टमात्मना सृष्टम्। तस्कृतेन शुभाशुभकर्मणोत्पन्नमिति कृत्वा। इन्द्रेण जुष्टमात्मना सेवितम्। तद्द्वरेण विज्ञानोत्पादनात् ॥ इन्द्रेण दत्तमात्मना विषयेभ्यो यथायथं ग्रहणाय ।Also. इन्द्रेणात्मना दुर्जयम् ।Bhattoji.

In the Vedantaमनस्, बुद्धि, अहंकार and चित्तare said to be the four internal organs. According to some these are the different faculties constitating the mind or अन्तःकरण Others add अन्तःकरण to the list making up aपञ्चक बुद्धिis evidently used here for the mind and not in the sense of the *Vedantins* अप्रतिहत—unrepulsed in full (un-impaired) vigour वचनम्–power or manner of speech अर्थोष्मन्—Comp.वित्तज उष्मा Pt. II. शौर्योष्मन् Mv. अन्य&c—becomes quite a changed man (inasmuch as he is differently treated by the world at large); see the next sI.

In doing this one is likely by habit to loss one's good disposition अनय—impudenos, impolitic conduct. अनवेक्षण—want of proper care or supervision. त्यागप्रमाद—carelessness or indiscretion (not exercising prudence and judgment) in expenditure, including charity, is evidently a better reading than.



 त्यागात् &c.where त्यागmeans 'liberality, giving away.' It also keeps up symmetry. Fig. तुल्ययोगिता, विनश्यति indicating the common attribute.

 SI. 43.गतिः—passage out; money goes out in these three ways. यो &c.—The language here is rather condensed. वित्तं must be supplied from the first line as the object of ददाति and वित्तस्य after तस्य which means 'his' answering to यः.

 SI. 44. शाणोल्लीढः—Out or

polished on a polishing stone हेतिनिहस—forcibly struck *i, e.* wounded with weapons. दलित *v.l*means ‘shattered, hewn, and is a stronger term than निहतः. मदक्षीणः—मदीन क्षीणः Inst. Tat; reduced by the flow of rut. Here क्षीणः has the same meaning as श्लक्ष्ण (thin, which is a mark of beauty). This is preferable to क्षीणमदःwhich is a Bah. and implies the cessation of the flow of rut, and therefore the poet uses the rather unusual Inst.Tat. आश्यान०—श्यानfrom श्यै to become dry or thick + त्त्कःshrunken. *Cf.* शनैः श्यानीभूताः सितजलघ- रच्छेदपुलिनाः।+ ++नमस्तः स्यन्दन्ते सरिन्ते इव दीर्घा दशादिशः॥Mud.

V. 16. quoted in the Com. also प्रणमन्त्यनपायमुत्थितं प्रतिपञ्चन्द्रमिव प्रजा नृपम्।Kir. II. 11. For the poetical account of the waning of the moon, supposed to be drunk in turns by the gods,

 Śl. 45. परिक्षीणः—Reduced in circumstances every way (परि): completely poverty-stricken. प्रसृतिproperly means the palm hollowed, hence by *Lakshaná* what is contained therein; also a measure equal to two *palas*. स्पृहयति—स्पृहgoverns the Dat. See Pân. I. 4. 56. सम्पूर्णःfull of, scil. wealth. opp. to परिक्षीणः Mark the force of the prepositions परिand सम् कलयति(a verb capable of a very large number of meanings according to context); here, thinks, considers.

 अतः—hence*; i. e*. because of the fact mentioned above. अनैकान्त्यं—The state of having no fixity uncertainty न एकान्तमने कान्तं तस्य भावः। The last two lines are somewhat puzzling and have been differently interpreted. For construction see com.. The meaning is that since there is variability with regard to the greatness or smallness of the same thing it must be concluded that it is the state of life of those possessed of wealth that causes the things so to appear.

 ŚI. 46. दुधुक्षसि—desiderative of दूह; although a द्विकर्मक root it is here used with one object. क्षितिधेनुम्—a Karm. and the Fig properly is रुपक. तेन— equivalent to तर्हि अद्य seems to have been used here in a wider sense:—now, at present. This verse gives a very sound advice to princes to secure the pros perity of their states. The last three lines contain an उपमाand the metaphor of the first has not been kept up. क्षितिtherefore should be taken as in the Com. *Cf.* Rag. I. 26. दुदोह गां&c.

 ŚI. 47. हिंस्रा—murderous, cruel, bloody. From हिंस्+र added ताच्छील्ये by 'नमिकम्पि &o.’ Pan. III. 2. 147. अर्थपरा-अर्थ एक परं यस्याः। with an eye solely to wealth; greedy. वदान्य—liberal,



 munificent. नित्यmay be taken either as *adj*. or *adv.* in the dissolution of the compounds, नित्यव्यया and प्रचुरनित्यधनागमा. The fig. is Upamâ.

 Śl. 48. आज्ञा—power to enforce command. Râmarshi considers the word ब्राह्मणानाम् to be an उपलक्षण *i.e.* as including all people. The Brahmanas are specially mentioned as most deserving help and protection, their priestly avocation making it impossible for them to defend themselves with arms &c. येषां एते &c. who have not gained these six qualities (special advantages). पार्थिवोपाश्रय—taking shelter with a king *i. e.*becoming royal servants or favourites. *Or* पार्थिव may be taken as Voc. singular; in this case तेषांmay refer to kings; what is the use of resorting to those kings who do not &c.

 ŚI. 49. मरुस्थले—मरु is the waterless tract now known as Marwar. म्रियन्तेऽस्मिन् भूतानि जलाभावात् इति मरुः, fr. मृ+उ Un. I. 7. मेरौ—on the mountain Meru, the store-house of wealth. According to the Puraņas the mountain Meru is formed of gold and jewels. It is the loftiest mountain on earth and the centre round which the whole.firmament revolves. कृपणां वृतिं ना कृथाः—do not act or behave in an abject manner. The last line shows that on the *capacity* of a man depends his fortune, and it should be rightly understood to counteract the effect of the first which is fatalistic. The fig. is Drstânta. See śl. 57.

 ŚI. 50.गोचर—moving within the range of the senses (गो);hence, known. See*supra* śl. 16. कार्पण्योक्तिः—words expressive of our pitiful condition, supplication.The fig. here isअप्रस्तुत—प्रशंसा. Some liberal person is addressed with these words which apparently refer to the cloud. अप्रस्तुतप्रशंसा is thus defined:—अप्रस्तुतप्रशंसा सा या सैव प्रस्तुताश्रया K.P.X.

 SI. 51. सावधानमनसा—with close or assiduous attention. एतादृशाः—suchreferring to चातकाधार in the above Śloka. Alhough the ślokas are not much connected with each other

stil



the poet allows the ellipsis to remain because it is so easy to supply it .केचित्.....केचित् some...others. यं यं पश्यसितस्य तस्य पुरतः—before every one that you see. The fig. is अप्रस्तुतप्रशंसा here.

 SI. 52. अकारणविग्रहः—causeless strife, unprovoked quarrel. इदम् refers to each of the foregoing nominatives.

 SI. 53. Every serpent of a particular species is supposed to have in its crest a jewel which shines by night. ‘The verse is attributed to Obánákya. See Kavyasangraha p. 293. and Sarangadhara p. 63.' Telang. The fig. is दृष्टांन्त by साधर्म्य. There is however a mixture of वस्तुप्रतिवस्तुभाव also.

 ŚI. 54. The language here is somewhat condensed. गुणः,दुर्जनैः and गण्यते have to be supplied with every clause. हीमति यः हीरुपः गुणः स जाड्ययमिति गण्यते &c. व्रतरुचि—one who likes to stick fast to religious observances. मुनि—ordinarily means मननशील(from मन+इन्the अbeing changed to उ by Un. IV. 123) one given to contemplation; hence here, a man of reserve, one who keeps silence.'वाचंयामो मुनिः' Amara. for the Vedântic meaning see Bg. II. 56. quoted in the com. मुखरता—मुखरस्य भावः.।fr. मुख+र. The possessive aff. र here implies censure. नामis used here सम्भाव्ये *i.e* to express possibility; or it mayhave the senseof'indeed.' अङ्कितः—branded.

 ŚI.55. लोभः—is regarded as the greatest of all evils being the origin of most of them. *Cf.* 'लोभः पापस्य कारणम्' Hit. I. 27. see com. अगुण—Here the नञ् shows विरोध or opposition. निजैः—If a man has सौजन्यhis courteous conduct will easily win over strangers and so there will be no lack of relatives to him wherever he may go. धनैः—The other reading जनैः does not yield a good sense. Bhartṛhari considers *Vidyá* as the best treasure. *Cf.* ŚI. 16, 20, 21, and 103. अपयशः—*Cƒ.* Bg. II. 34. quoted in the com. न भीतो मरणादस्मि केवलं दूषितं यशः। Mrch.

 ŚI. 56. दिवसं०—दिवसेन (Inst हेतौ) धूसरः rendered pale by (the overpowering light of) day; अनक्षरम्–अविद्यमानमक्षरं यत्र



 तत्। Nan. Bah. स्वाकृतेः–सुटु आकृतिर्यस्य तस्य।*Cf.* 'unlettered, illiterate'in English. Want of learning becomes a disgrace more marked in such a case.सततदुर्गतः—Here the word सततis to be emphasised. नृपाङ्गण–Both अङ्कनand अङ्कणare found used by classical writers, though the former is the correct form. The change of न to ण in अङ्कण is explained by referring it to the पृषोदरादि group. ०गतः खलः a wicked man gone to the courtyard of a king's palace. This may also be metaphorical—who has curried royal favour. This sl. is quoted in the K. P. as an instance of the fig. समुच्चय–अत्र शशिनि धुसरे शल्ये शल्यान्तराणीति शोभनाशोभनयोगः(of causes which are partly agreeable and partly otherwise). For definition seecom. Here the moon alone obscured by day is sufficient to become a

s'alya (sore affliction) and yet others are mentioned.

 ŚI. 57. होतारम्—Here the word is used in its general sense; any sacrificer (comp. याच होत्रीŚák I. 1.) and has nothing to do with the priest of that name at a great sacrifice.जुह्वान–This is not the pre. p. of the root as it is always Par.; but formed with the aff. चानश्;see noted on जीवमानः Śl. 12.पावकः—पुनातीति fire; पृ+ण्वुल (अक). The fig. is Drstánta which is thus defined—दृष्टान्ताः पुनरेतेषां (उपमानोपमेयसाधर्म्याणां सर्वेषां प्रतिबिम्बनम्। K.P. X.

 ŚI. 58. चाटुलः—चटुल एव चाटुलः। चटुल from चटु+ल (लच्)a possessive affix added to the words.of the सिध्मादिclass; see Pán. V. 2. 97; garrulous, officious. जल्पकः—The proper form isजल्पकः; if we add आक (पाकन्) by जल्पभिक्ष्—Pan. III. 2. 155.*Cf*. Amara 'स्याज्जल्पाकस्तु वाचालः'. But as the form stands, it must be explained as जल्पतीति जल्पः, कुत्सित जल्पः जल्पकः अप्रगल्भ–timid. For the meaning of प्रगल्भ*cf*.'पुंवत् प्रगल्भा प्रतिहाररक्षी'Rag. VI. 20.अभिजातः—noble-born, polite in behaviour,courteous.योगिनामपि—Yogins have superhuman power by their practice of contemplation and so they must know every thing. But this is unfathomable even to them. अगम्यः—difficult to obtain success in; difficult properly to carry out.



 The other reading वातुलः for चाटुलः avoids repetition, the meaning in that case being 'delirious'; but when we look to what the common parlance is in this connection, this reading does not seem to be preferable. 

 ŚI. 59. उद्भाº—of one that has brightened all wicked men,*i. e*. a scoundrel of the first rank, who has brought credit to the whole class. विशृङ्खल—unbridled; one licensed as it were to indulge in all sorts of wicked deeds. प्राग्जाता &c.—see com. It will be inappropriate to analyse as कर्मसु वृत्तिःsince it continues even now. With the reading विस्तृत for विस्मृतthe sense is 'whose indulgence in wicked conduct commenced before is now developed.'–Telang. In this case dissolve प्राग्जातापश्चात् विस्तृता निजाधमकर्मसु वृतिः यस्य।

 ŚI. 60. This verse very cleverly describes friendship as we find it in the world. Insincere friendship shows at its highest at the very beginning, but gradually vanishes and is compared to the shadow in the morning which is longest at sunrise and goes on contracting till noon. A good man's friendship, however, is hardly preceptible, like the mid-day shadow, at first, but goes on steadily increasing.

 गुर्वी—*Fem.*of गुरु; also गुरु; see notes on Sl. 20. दिनस्य—to be connected with पूर्वार्ध&c. by what is called एकादेशी अन्वय like देवदत्तस्य गुरुकुलम्;see note on परेषांSI. 20. The fig. is *Upamá*mixed with यथासंख्य

 Śl. 61. तृणः&c.–निष्कारण–those that are*causelessly*enemies; निष्कारणं वैरिणः।The fig. of speech here is यथासंख्यwhich is defined as यथासंख्यं क्रमेणैव क्रमिकाणां समन्वयः K. P. X. Here लुब्धक, धीवर and पिशुन are mentioned as the respective enemies of मृग, मीन and सज्जन.

 ŚI. 62. व्यसनं—close application, strong attachment..खलेसंसर्गमुक्तिः—There is एकदेशी अन्वय here, खले यः संसर्गः तस्मात् मुक्तिः।We have preferred the sing. to the plural as it keeps up



 the uniformity of construction with regard to the use of the sing. throughout.

 ŚI. 63.वाक्पटुता—cleverness in speech, command overlanguage,eloquence. व्यसनं श्रुतौ—From the way in which the study of the Vedas is frequently referred to in the *S'atakas* we may infer that Bhartrhari was not a Buddhist. *Cf*. ŚI, 66, 67; see Introduction.

 ŚI. 64. संभ्रम—means आदर; see com.; it also means haste which sense will also do here if we take विधि to mean आदरविधिas remarked by Mr. Telang—'It would mean the flutter of preparation to do due honour.' कथनं चाप्युपकृतेः *v. i*. will mean–proclaiming the good deeds of others in an assembly. निरभिभवº–अभिभवः(insult, contempt); सारः essence, gist; conversation about others without meaning the least offence; even the pith of which is free from disrespect to others. असिधाराव्रतम्—the vow of lying on the edge of a sword; also, explained otherwise as the practice of continence even in the company of a young wife. See note on ŚI. 28. This ŚI. is quoted in the Kuvalayâ nanda as an instance of समुच्चयालङ्कार,with some variations—प्रदानं प्रच्छन्नं गृहमुपगते संभ्रमविधिर्निरुत्सेको लक्ष्म्यामनभिभवगन्धाः परकथाः।प्रियं कृत्वा मौनं सदसि कथनं चाप्युपकृतेः श्रुतेत्यन्तासक्तिः पुरुषमभिजातं कथयति॥

 ŚI. 65. त्यागcharity. *Cf*. दानेन पाणिःsI.71. श्लाष्यः—some take this with त्यागas well as with the nominatives following it, with the necessary change of gender.विजयिº विजयते तच्छीलौविजयिनी ever victorious; तौच तौभुजौच &c. Some separateविजयिनौmaking it an *adj.* to वीर्यम्. हृदि—Loc. sing. of हृदय which optionally becomes हृद from the Acc,plural. हृत् also occurs as a word by itself, but its use is rare. 'स्वान्तं हृन्मानसं मनः'।Amara. श्रुतम्—Holy knowledge: or knowledge in general. *Cf.*श्रोत्रं श्रुतेनैव न कुण्डलेनsl. 71 *infra.* The fig. is विभावना since there is the mani- festation of the effect, मण्डन, although its cause ऐेश्वर्य has been denied; क्रियायाः \[हेतोः\] प्रतिषेधोपि फलव्यक्तिर्विभावना।K. P. X.



 ŚI. 66 महाशैल &c.–शिलानां संघातः शिलासंघातः।महांश्वासौशैलश्व महाशैलः तस्य शिलासंघातः like a dense (सं) line (घात) of rocks &c. The fig. here is Upamá

वत्the simile-expressing aff. being omitted in the compound उत्पलकोमलम्.For a similar ides, see śl. 63

 SI. 67. नमामि न श्रुयते—even its name is not heard *i. e.* no trace of it is left. ज्ञायते *V.I*. known *i. e.* through the medium of the ears, मुक्ताकारतया—by reason of its assuming the form of a pearl. स्वात्याम्—In Sváti *i. e.* while the sun is in conjunctionwith the constellation Sváti, It is supposed that at the time of the sun coming in conjunction with this constellation. the pearlshells burst open and the rain-drops that they receive into their cavity form pearls, see Brhatsamhita of Varahamihira XV. 13. *Cf.* पात्रविशेषे न्यस्तं गुणान्तरं ब्रजति शिल्पमाधातुः।जलमिवसमुद्रशुक्तौमुक्ताफलतां पयोदस्य॥ MaI. I. 6. सन्मौक्तिकम्—A good or faultless pearl. सत् is evidently preforable to तत्. जायते—Since this verb is repeated a strict rhetorician would detect in this कथितपंददोष(the fault of repeating a word with the same meaning). The reading—जुषां&o. is free from this fault. The figure is Arthantaranyâsa.

 ŚI. 68. Some take एवwithभर्तुः,but that is not good; the construction should be यद्भतुंर्हितमेवेच्छति तत्कलत्रम्–meaning ‘she that desires *the good only* of her husband deserves to be called'wife.'कलत्रम् Mark the gender of this word which is *new;*the gender of Sanskrt words in some cases is quite arbitrary as remarked by Pán.—लिङ्गमशिष्यं लोकाश्व्यात्वल्लिङ्गस्य।*Cf.* the word दार which is *mas*. and is always used in the plural.पुण्यकृतः—पुण्यं कृतवान् पुण्यकृत् .The aff. क्विप्(०–त्) is added to कृ after the words mentioned in the

sutra सुकर्मपापमन्त्रपुण्येषु कृतःPân. III. 2. 89.

 SI. 69. नम्रत्वेनोन्नमन्तः—rising to greatness by humility. ख्यापयन्तः—pres. p. of causal of ख्या. Their appreciation of other people's merits is in itself a sign of their possessing merits.वितत०—दुषयन्तः—rebuking. Contemptuous silence is the best



 treatment of a caluminstor. साश्चर्यचर्याः—आश्वर्यसहिता admirable,चर्या (चरितम्) येषां ते. The fig here is Viródhābháss.

 SI. 70. भूरिविलम्बिनः—hanging very low. This reading is preferable to भूमि० as the point here is नम्रत्व. अनुद्धताः—Not. haughty. समृद्धिाभिः—with the acquisition of wealth. This sl. occurs in the Sâk. Act. V. The figures in this s'l. according to Rághavabhatta are क्रियादीपक मालाप्रतिवस्तूपमा (विनयस्य साधारणधर्मस्य नम्रदूरविलम्ब्यनुद्धतशब्देनोक्तेः), अप्रस्तुतप्रशंसा and अर्थान्तरन्यास (स्वभाव इत्यादिस्तु हिशब्दानुपादानेऽर्थान्तरन्यासः).

 SI. 71. *Cf. s.l,*65*supra*. The fig. here is परिसंख्या as the*S'ástras* &c.are specially mentioned as imparting beauty to the ear &c. to the exclusion of the ear-ornaments &c. It is thusdefined—किंचित्पृष्टमपृष्टं वा कथितं यत्प्रकल्पते। तादृगन्यव्यपोहाय परिसंख्या तु सा स्मृता।K. P X.  
 SI. 72 पापात्—That from which a person is warded off is put in the Abl. case; see. com. हिताय योजयते—may mean (1) हितंसाधयितुं (हितकरे कर्मणि) मित्रं प्रवर्तयति urges(his friend) to apply himself to a work beneficial to him; or (2) आत्मानं योजयते—sets himself about the ab accomplishment of his friend's good. The Dat. is to be explained by 'क्रियार्थोपपदस्य च कर्मणि स्थानिनः'Pan. II.3.14. When an infinitive of purpose is not actually used in a sentence its object is put in the Dat.case; फलेभ्यो याति, फलान्याहर्तुं यातीत्यर्थः Sid. Kau.

 SI. 73. विकचीकरोति—cause to bloom, opens. A denom. verb derived from विकच with the aff च्वि (०). विकच—विगतःकचः (fold) अस्मात्; full blown or expanded. कैरव—awhite lotus.Like कुमुद it is a lotus blooming at moon-rise. चक्रवाल—a collection of; properly a

circle of, 'चक्रवालं तुं मण्डलम्'।Amara.नाम्यर्थितः to be taken with all the three—दिनकर, चन्द्र and जलधरअभिर्योगे—application, resolutely setting oneself about. Fig.*Arthántaranyása.*

 ŚI. 74.एते—Mr. Telang reads एके 'some'. ते एते, however, serves as a better correlative of ये and gives proper force to the main assertion. घंटकाः—who bring about, accomplish. उद्यमभृतः—



 उद्यमं बिभ्रतीति; सोद्ममा इत्यर्थः।स्वार्थाविराधेन—विरोधस्याभावःअविरोधः;स्वार्थेन अविरोधः, तेन*i. e.* without sacrificing their own good.स्वार्थाय—*i.e.* स्वार्थं साधयितुम्. See note on हिताय SI. 72.

   Śl. 75. पुरा—at first *i.e*. before it was placed on fire.ताप—(1) heat; (2) trouble. हि—अवधारणेMark!; or, surely, verily. उन्मनस्—

sager, तेन जलेन युक्तम्—reunited with the same water.

शाम्यति—becomes calm, settles down. The stanza draws a very nice moral lesson from a common occurrence in the kitchen. The milk on being well heated begins to boil over; but if water is added to it, it settles down. The fig.s are क्रियास्वरुपोत्प्रेक्षाsupported by अर्थान्तरन्यास.

 ŚI. 76. इतः—when repeated this has the sense of here there, in one place, in another

केशव or विष्णुis called जलशायी,'जलशायी विष्णुरुपो'Amara.and क्षीराब्धिनिवासी. कुलं—family, a host of (सजातीयैः कुलम्). तदीयद्विषाम्—Of Kesava's enemies, the demons. For the account of the Kalakeyas hiding themselves in the sea, see Mah, Bhar. Van. P. 101, 105. शरणार्थिनः&c.— chains of mountains seeking shelter (sail. from the wrath of Indra). See notes on s'l. 36. Comp. पक्षच्छिदा गोत्रभिदात्तगन्धाः शरण्यमेन शतशो महीध्राः। नृपा इवोपप्लविनः परेभ्यो धर्मोत्तरं मध्यमामाश्रयन्तो।According to the Hariv. Mainaka appears to be the only mountain that took refuge in the sea. The poets speak of more mountains as having taken refuge probably only to magnify the greatness of the sea. संवर्तकैः—with the fires that destroy the world at the end of the creation. The Commentator Rámarshi gives to this word the sense सकलजलचरजीवविशेष, in addition, but this is quite obscure. संवर्नis also a particular cloud though it is not intended here. For वडवानल see Matsya Puráṇa CLXXIV.49. et. sep. and Mis. sI.9 भर०—सहने इति सहं भरस्य सहं भर० able to bear a great load, mighty. This may be looked upon as an instance of

अप्रस्तुतप्रशंसा the अप्रस्तुत not being directly mentioned. 

 Sl. 77. In line 3 the Nirnayaságar Edition reads प्रख्यापयfor प्रच्छादय which will suit only with the reading प्रश्रयम् for स्वाद् गुणान्see com.; as it stands, however, it is entirely objection–



 able. Mr. Telang thinks the construction of the stanza to be similar to that of Sis. I, 5I, which is according to the Sútraसमुच्चयेऽन्यतरस्याम्. In such constructions all the verbs must be in the Imperative mood. Here मावमंस्थाःmust be considered as equivalent in sense to the Imperative mood. लक्षणम्—Mr. Telang adopts the reading चोटेतम्. But then what does एतद्refer to? Certainly to the actions indicated by छिन्धि &c.; so this amounts to एतत् चेष्टितं

सतांचेष्टितम्. लक्षणं is thereforebetter. Such acts are the sign of &c.

 Śl. 78. पुण्यपीयूषº—full of nectarions holiness or holy thought &c. पर्वतीकृत्य—magnifying to the size of a mountain, making much of. कियन्तः—some, few, rare. Mr. Telang compares with this the use of कश्चित्in Bhag. VII. 3.एतेन वाचाकर्मणा च सर्वेषामुपकारवन्त इत्यर्थः।Rámarshi.

 ŚI. 79. हेमगिरि—the mountain of gold, मेरु. रजताद्रि–Kailása, being white (on account of being covered with snow), is considered to be a mountain of silver. This cannot be Himálaya as some take it. *Cf*. Meg. I. 58. यत्र &c.—The trees on other mountains are the same that they are; they are not changed into sandal trees as they would be if they grew on the Malaya mountain. Malaya, a mountain in the south of India, famed for its sandal trees. मन्यामहे—we honour. *Cf*. अहमेव मतो महीपतेःRag. VIII. 8, and Mallinátha's com. thereon. The fig. is Viródhábhása.

 SI. 80. रत्नैर्महार्हैः—with the 13 valuable jewels (churned out of the ocean before obtaining the 14th—nectar). भीमविषेण &o.—did not take affright at the appearance of the dreadful poison.निश्चितार्यात्—The Abl. by the Várt. जुगुप्सा&c. see com. See Apte's G.§ 76. *Cf.* प्रारब्धमुत्तमजना न परित्याजन्ति। The fourteen jewels are mentioned in the following verse—लक्षीः कौस्तुभपारिजातकसुरा धन्वन्तरिश्चन्द्रमा गावः कामदुधाः सुरेश्वरगजोरम्भादिदेवाङ्गनाः।अश्वः

सप्तमुखो विषं हरिधनुः शंखोमृतं चाम्बुधे

रत्नानीह चतुर्दश प्रतिदिनं कुर्वन्तु

वो मङ्गलम्॥For the story, see Råmá. Bal. K. XLV. Bhâg. P. VII. 9-8. Nî. Sat. 27. The fig. here is Arthântaranyása.



  Śl. 81. क्वचित्–may better be taken as an adv. of time;at one time; at another, भूमीशायी is a better reading than भूमौ शायीas keeping up symmetry. शाल्योदन—Having a liking for Salt (a superior kind of paddy) only. कन्थाधारी—One wearing a wallet. मनस्वी—from मनस्+षिणिःhigh-souled, also wise विन्shows प्रशस्त्य .कार्यार्थी (कार्य अर्थयते इति) One that seeks to gain his object. This as well as कन्थधारी and शाकाहारी are formed by affixing इन् (णिनिः) by सुप्यजातौ णिनिस्ताच्छील्ये (इन् is added to a root in the sense of 'in the habit of' when it is preceded by a noun not denoting a class ). कार्यार्थीmay also be taken. as in the com.

 Śl. 82. उपशम्—Sabduing the passions, tranquillity. प्रभविद्—One possessing absolute power. This is the only concrete noun used in the s'loka for प्रभावस्य. निर्व्याजता—freedom from hypocrisy. सर्वेषाम्&c.—Some take this to mean 'of all persons,' in which sense अपिwould be superfluous. सर्वकारणम्cause of all i. e. of ऐश्वर्य. सुजनता&c. शील–virtuous or good conduct.

 ŚI. 83,नीति—The conduct of human affairs, rules of life. यदि वा—is equivalent here to अथवा. न्याय्यात्–see Sl. 28. *supra.* धीराः—धियं बुद्धिमीरयन्ति सर्वतः प्रवर्तयन्तीति। Rämarshi The wise.

 SI. 84. कदर्थितस्य p. p. of कदर्थय् denom fr. कदर्थ(कुत्सितोर्थः) of one who is despised, afflicted, worried: प्रमार्ष्टुम्—to wipe off completely, to obliterate. Mr. Telang rightly remarks that अधोमुखस्य कृतस्य is not a usual construction and that therefore the reading तनुनपातः—(see foot-note p. 34) is better. This however, is open to another objection; for it involves the दोष—अप्रयुक्तत्व, the word तनूनपात्—though given by the lexicographers for fire, being hardly, if ever, used by the poets. The fig is Drstânta.

 ŚI. 85. न लुनन्ति 'cut or wound', or pierce. कटाक्षविशिखाः—arrows in the form of glances. कृशानुः–कृश्यतिthat which reduces size; hence fire; कृश+आनु (क). Construe यस्य चित्तं कान्तान खनन्ति ०तापः न दहति and so on.



 ŚI. 86. साधु &c.—The word वृत्त has a double application here; as applied to the ball साधुवृत्त means (साधु यथा तथा वृत्ताः) well-rounded, perfectly spherical, is the other case it means 'of virtuous conduct, whose course of actions is well-regulated."*Cf.* 'वृत्ते स्थितस्याधिपतेः प्रजानाम्' Rag. V. 33. अस्थायिन्यः—not abiding, short-lived. The Figures are *Arthántaranyása* *and S'les'a.*

 SI. 88 तस्य जलायते—तस्य towards him; in his case. जलायते &c. are denominative verbs, formed by adding य in the sense of acts like that;' see com.; and are conjugated in the A'tmanepada. कुल्यायते—acts like a canal. i. e. assumes the narrownessof a canal. कुरङ्गायते—becomes tame like a deer. माल्यगुण—a wreath of flowers, a garland, पीयुषवर्षायते—produces the effects of a shower of nectar.

 SI. 89. उपचीयते—increases, waxes. The root चि with उपpass, means to grow in bulk, to thrive, as अपाच means todecrease in bulk. सन्तप्यन्ते—are not grieved, विप्लुताः—overpowered by difficulties. न ते विपदा—is a better reading being easier.

 ŚI. 90. नेता—guide, adviser. *Cf*. अमात्ये नेतरि सुलभमेतत्कुमारस्य
Mud. II. वृहस्पति—The spiritual adviser and counsellor of Indra. For derivation see sl. 34. अनुग्रहः किल हरेः,who, as is well-known (किल) enjoys the favour of Hari. ऐरावतः—इर आपः सन्त्यस्मिन् इरावान् तत्र भवः (अण्)lit. sprung from water. The name of Indra's elephant obtained at the churning of the milky ocean. ऐश्वर्यवल—may be taken as a Tat. or a Dwandwa. The latter is preferable. ऐश्वर्य—means here the accompaniments of royalty. भग्नः had to yield, was routed. दैवशरणन्*v. l*.—A poetical license. The poet's meaning is दैवं शरणं (रक्षिता) वरंand so the two words cannot be compounded.As it stands we may explainदैवं शरणं दैवशरणम्। धिक् धक् &c.—This may be taken in two  
 N. N. 3



 ways:—धिग्धिक् as an interjection andवृथा पौरुषं separately; or the whole together as meaning—'Fie upon vain valour.'

 SI. 91.

भग्नाशस्य—whose hopes (of escape) had baffled.

करण्ङ &c.—whose body was pressed in the basket.

म्लानेº—weakened (by hunger). पिशितं—from पिश् to shape+हत, (पिश्अवयवे; पिशेः किञ्च Un. III. 95 इति इतन्) raw flash. वृद्धौ क्षये—When a noun indicating 'cause,' is used, the effect is often put in the Loc. See Apte's Guide § 95.

 ŚI. 92. फलंi. e. the good or bad result of their actions, happiness or misery. कर्मायत्तं—*Cf. Ś1*. s. 99, 101, 102. Here there is a reference to the two of the three divisions of *Karman* vizसञ्चित, प्रारब्धand क्रियमाण. सुधिया सुविचार्यैव कुर्वता भाब्यम्= सुधिया सुविचार्यैव व्यवहारः कार्यः।The construction should be noted. When the potential pass. p. is used as predicate the noun or adjective coming after it (as कुर्वताhere) must agree with the agent (सुधिया here).

 SI. 93. खल्वाटः—a bald-headed man. सशब्दं—i. e. the fruit making a loud noise as it fell. ‛The fact of the tree being ताल (Palm) adds to the force of the lines as it gives little or no shade" Telang. The fig. is *Arthántaranyása.*

 Śl. 94. ग्रहपीडनम्—trouble from ग्रह—vis. Ráhu. मतिमतां here the aff मत्, expresses प्राशस्त्य or excellence. *Cf.* the last line with लिखितमपि ललाटे प्रोज्झितुंकःसमर्थः H. 'In the Kâvyasangraha this stanza is given as Vetâlabhatta's p. 39'. Mr.Telang'e note. The figures are *Arthantaranyasa* and *Kavyalinga.*

 ŚI. 95. सृजति the subject to this is विधिto be supplied from the context. तावत्—some Commentators, interpret this as प्रथमम्. It seems, however, to be used here अवधारणे'indeed', does create. पुरुषरत्नम्—The jewel of a man (पुरुष एवरत्नम्); the best of men. It may also be explained though not preferably as पुरुषः रत्नमिव (jewel-like) *Cf.* जतौ जातौ यदुत्कृष्टंतद्रत्नमिति कथ्यते। Malli on Rag. XVI.1. अलङ्करकम्—anornament (beautifier) of. Here ल्युट (अन्)is added

.

 to तथापि. तत्क्षणभङ्गि—स एव क्षणः तत्क्षणः the moment aman becomes a P*urusharatna;* तस्मिन् मज्यते इत्ये वंशीलम्।

 SI. 96. नायकोप्योष० ओषः (fr. उष् to burn) पाको घीयते अत्र इति औषधिः।A plant, & medicinal drug; also an herb which dies when its fruit becomes ripe. The moon is often called the Lord of herbs, probably because plants thrive under the influence of moon-light. *Cf*. Rg. X. 84,—'सोमेनादित्याबलिनः सोमेन पृथिवी मही।' where Säyans says–अमृतसेकेनौषध्यभिवृद्ध्या पृथिव्या बलवत्वम्। 'ततस्तस्मै ददो राज्यं ब्रह्मा ब्रह्मविदां वरः। बीजौषधीनां विप्राणामपां च जनमेजय'॥ Hv. XXV. See also Vay. P. XX VIII 12.16. Mat 'P. XXIII. 10–13. More probably, however, औषधीनाथ is *Soma,*the plant, the juice of which formed the well-known beverage of the ancient Rshis. By a curious misapplication of names the term *Soma* came to be an appellation of the moon and so all the epithets of Soma, the plant, were transferred to Soma, the moon. See notes on Rsg. II. 73, भिषक्–विभेत्यस्माद्रोगः & physivian. शतभिषक्–(1) & hundred physicians; (2) name of the 24th lunar mansion (the Satatárakas) containing one hundred Stars. अवतंस—an ear-ring or an ornament worn on the head. All these adjectives indicate that the moon had the means to counteract the effect of the disease. राजयक्ष्मा—consumption which attacked the moon; also consumption in general. So called because it is, as it were, the prince of diseases (यक्ष्मणां रोगाणां राजा). *Cf.* राजयक्ष्मेव रोगाणां समूहः स महीभृताम् Sis. II. 96, commenting on which Malli quotes from Vägbhatta—अनेकरोगानु० (seecom.)—शोषो रोगराडिति च स्मृतः॥ नक्षत्राणां द्विजानां च राज्ञोऽभूद्यदयं पुरा। यच्च राजा च यक्ष्मा च राजयक्ष्मा ततो मतः॥ The moon was cursed to be eternally consumptive by his father-in-law, Daksha, for paying sole attention to Rohini and neglecting his other daughters. At the intercession of his wives the sentence of enternal consumption was commuted to one of periodical consumption.

 SI. 97. प्रभुणा—प्रभवतीति प्रभुः, used in a literal senes, powerful having power to dispense प्रमाणीकृतं—प्राप्यत्वेन निर्णीतम्



 Râmarshi; marked or settled as one's measure *i. e.*portion destined to fall to one's share.उपनमेत्—Lit. go to, fall to one's lot. Comp. for this sense of नम् with उप, इदमुपनतमेवं रूपमक्लिष्टकान्तिŚak. V. 19. कस्यात्यन्तं सुखमुपनतं &c. Meg. Some read उपनयेत् supplying दैवं as the subject, but then the construction becomes clumsy. कारणम्—*i.e.* to obtain more. आशा—directions; there is also an indirect reference to the other meaning—'hopes, expectations'. वर्षति—Loc. of the pres. p of वृष्, which, though trans,is here used intransitively as its object जल is well-known. *Cf.*

&c.' Pan. III. 1. 114. चातकमुखे—The bird चातक is supposed to drink only a few drops of rain water when the sun is in

Sváti.

Various discrepant stories. are current about this bird with which every one is familiar. मेघः—मेहति सिञ्चतीति.  

 ŚI. 99. नमस्यामः—A denominative, य (क्यच्) is added to नमःin the sense of 'paying homage to'; नमस्यति देवान् । पूजयतीत्यर्थः। Sid. Kau. on Pan. III. 1. 19. ननु—here used to introduce anobjection—but, are they not &c. हतविधी–

accursed fat*e. Cf*. हत–हृदयं Sak. VI. 6.

हतविधिलसितानां

हि विचित्रो विपाकः। Śis. XI. 64. The word दग्ध is also similarly used. See Vai. Sat. śl. 22. The word हतकis more commonly used in this sense but at the end of a Comp.; न खलु विदितास्ते चाणक्यहतकेन । Mud. II. परिभूताः स्थरामहतकेन । Uttar. I. वशगाः—पशं गच्छन्तीति वशगाः।under the power of fate. The gods, Indra included, are finite beings, whose existence as separate deities terminates at the end of a *Kalpa*



 and whose sovereignty in heaven is not permanent.प्रतिनियत&c.—एकं केवलमेव फलमेकफलं कर्मण एकफलं कर्मैकफलं; प्रतिनियतं व्यवस्थितंpre-determined, fixed;

कर्मैकफलं ददाति इति. Even *Vidhi* has no arbitrary power to dispense fruits. It is entirely guided by men's actions in the distribution thereof. The poet here distinguishes between *Vidhi* and *karman*.—कर्मभ्यः—Every action must bear its fruit, good or bad. *Cf*. 'न हि कर्माणि क्षीयन्ते।'Mahabharata, and the well-known Smrti 'नाभुक्तं क्षीयते कर्म।'न येभ्यः प्रभवति—The Dat. by

'नमःस्वस्तिस्वाहास्वधालंवषड्योगाञ्च'।Pan. II. 3. 16. Here नप्रभवति is equivalent to नालम्। The Gen. may also be used with words like प्रभु &c.; 'प्रभ्वादियोगे षष्ठ्यपि साधुः।तेन प्रभुर्बुभूषुर्भुवनत्रयस्येति सिद्धम्।Sid. Kau. The Fig. here is *Sára*which is defined as उत्तरोत्तरमुत्कर्षो भवेत्सारः परावधिः।K. P. X. Sára or climax is that in which excellence rising successively ultimately reaches its culminating point.

 ŚI. 100. कुलालवत्—Like a potter. Here the

aff. वत् refers to the क्रिया *viz*. the work of forming things which Brahmå has to do like a potter fashioning his clay-things. ब्रह्माण्डभण्डोदरे— in the cavity of the immense vessel of the primordial egg, (bursting which Brahmâ came out and out of which the universe sprang); See Manu. I. 11—13 and Mat. P. II. 24. *et. seq*. उदरे—because the two shelves of the egg from the extreme boundaries of the universe within which every existing thing is situated. नियमित–restrained, chained down as it were. विष्णुः—The name is thus popularly derived–यस्माद्विश्वमिदं

सर्बंतस्य शक्त्यामहात्मनः। तस्मादेवोच्यते विष्णुर्विशधातोः प्रवेशनात्॥ वशावतार०–two constructions are possible:—(1) गहन may be taken as meaning a forest (

दशावतारा एव गहनं) and महासंकटे as a Bah. Comp. meaning

'bese with great difficulty.' (2) The other way is to take गहनan *adj.* *qualifying*

महासङ्कटे (a noun) meaning 'the great difficulty.' The latter way is preferable. Vishnu was cursed by Durvasas to undergo the penalty of being born on the earth ten times. The ten incarnations are given in the following couplet—मत्स्यःकूर्मो वराहश्व नरसिंहोथ वामनः। रामो



 रामश्व कृष्णश्च बुद्धः कल्की च ते दश॥ रुद्राः—

रोदयत्यसुरान् इति fr.–रुद्र + र Un. II. 22. The Srutis derive the word differently. *cf.*सोऽरोदीद्यदरोदीत्तद्रुद्रस्य रुद्रत्वम्' ।Also रुजः सर्वगता यस्मात्

हारयमिजगज्जयम्। रोदनं हन्मि यस्माञ्च रुद्रस्तस्मादहं प्रिये॥ Ska. P. कपालपाणि–पुटके—कपालसहितं पाणिपुटकं कपाल०; aMadhyamapadalopi Comp.कपाल—a human skull. The story of Rudra's begging with a skull in his hand is given in the Ska. P. सूर्यः—see sI. 98. According to Rámarshi the term सूर्य includes the stars and other heavenly bodies (श्रीसूर्य इत्युपलक्षणम्। चन्द्रादयो ग्रहा अपि भ्रमन्ति।). We extract the following from Mr. Telang's notes:—The santiment of this stanza again shocks the orthodoxy of the Commentator. One copy of the commentary has the following.

ब्रह्मविष्णुसूर्यादीनां प्राचीनकर्म वर्तते इति वक्तंनैवोचितम्। दृष्टान्तस्तावदेकदेशी वर्तते। तैर्यत्कार्यमङ्गीकृतं तत्कुर्वन्ति। दृष्टान्तस्तु लोक- व्यवहारार्थं लिखितः कर्मणि सहत्त्वस्थापनार्थम्॥ but the idea is not so uncommon a one as this indicates. Thus in the Yoga-Vâsishtha quoted in the commentary on the Ramayana p. 12 ( Bom. Ed.), we read तेनापिशापितो विष्णुः सर्वज्ञत्वंतवास्ति यत्। किंचित्कालं हि तत्त्यक्त्वा त्वमज्ञानीभविष्यसि॥ And this is given as the occasion of Vishnu's incarnations. Another account of them may be seen at Matsya Purána XLVII., 103. 4, where Bhrgu says to Vishnu: 'यस्मात्ते

जानतेधर्ममवन्ध्या स्त्री निषूदिता॥ तस्मात्त्वंसप्तकृत्वेह मानुषेषूपपत्स्यसि॥ ततस्तेना

भिशापेन नष्टे धर्मे पुनः पुनः॥ लोकस्य च हितार्थाय जायते

मानुषेविह॥'This stanza occurs in Kavyasangraha p. 6.

 Remarks:—The sI.is faulty in many ways as regards the construction and meaning of almost every line. The Tad. aff.बत् is used in such instances as

ब्राह्मणवदधीते (see Pan.V. I. 115). Here वत् has a distinct relation with अधीते *i.e.* the क्रिया. Now here कुलालवत् is to be taken with नियमित wherein the action is implied. Then the construction becomes ब्रह्मा येन कुलालवत्ब्रह्माण्डभाण्डोदरे नियमितः &c.Here

ºभाण्डोदरे goes well with Brahma but not with कुलाल as it is absurd to suppose aकुलाल to be confined in a pot. Again Rámarshi says ब्रह्माण्डभाण्डे नियमित *i. e*ब्रह्माण्डभाण्डानिविधातुं नियमितः—but then what is the meaning



 of गहन ? In the second line there is nothing objectionable but the construction is ambiguous, गहन being a noun as well as an adjective. In the third line the Comp. कपालपाणिपुटकेis to be understood as a Madhyamapadalopi. Then followsभिक्षाटनम्. Now what relation is there between कपालºand भिक्षाटनम् ? If any sense is to be given to the clause we must understandपुटके भिक्षा तदर्थमटनम् taking it as एकदेशी अन्वय. Perhaps the poet wrote ºपटुकःqualifying रुद्रः, के being a mistake for कोcommitted by some careless scribe. Again in the fourth line. the casual sense so prominently expressed by नियमित, क्षिप्तand कारितa altogether disappears भ्राम्यति being used. Thus there is the fault calledप्रक्रमभङ्ग

 Śl. 101. आकृति—stands for शोभनाकृति a graceful form. फलति—hears the desired fruit. सञ्चितानि—Fate is of three kinds; सञ्चित, प्रारब्ध and क्रियमाण. There is a reference here to the first kind. The fig. is Dīpaka the predicate expressing theधर्म being only once expressed. There is also *Upamá.*

 SI. 102. महार्णवे—अर्णोसि सन्त्यस्मिन्

इति अर्णवः fr. अर्णम् water+the *matub.* aff. व, the स्being irregularly dropped before it.विषमस्थितम्—in a critical or trying position. विषम is a generic term for difficulty. *Cf.* Bhatti. VI. 88 and Bg. II. 2. where the venerable Śankaracharya renders विषमे byसमयस्थाने पुराकृतानि पुण्यानि—This and the preceding sl. show that theauthor believed in a former birth,which Buddism does not recognise. See Introduction*. Cf* .अरक्षितं तिष्ठति दैवरक्षितम्। Pt. I.

सत्क्रिया

virtuous conduct. *Cf.'*शकुन्तला



 मूर्तिमती च सत्क्रिया' Sak. V. 15. “With the reading वक्रिकाम् which would seem to mean "crookedness" the meaning of the Stanza must be 'that which makes wicked men of good ones,' &c.. This is also the meaning according to Râmarshi with the reading चक्रिकाम्, which he interpretsto be either सरस्वती or लक्ष्मी,"वक्रेणं विनास्मिन्युगे फलं न भवति(commentaty.)" Mr. Telang.व्यसनैः—used adverbially here, meaning 'with persistent application(for the acquisition of merits)'. आस्था—an energetic effort.

The propriety of the words अनङ्ग° is not clear. Probably the idea is that pearls dropped down at such a time are not noticed; so Lakshmi vanishes imperceptibly.दिशः&c.—seecom.; दिशो दृश्यताम्—*v.I*. Lit. the state of being visible only at the end of quarters *i. e.* not within the reach of eyesight. The words may also be taken separately दिशोऽदृश्यताम्दिशः भ्रश्यददृश्यतां प्रयाति Ranning in all directions disappears. Mr. Telang proposes the reading दृशोऽदृश्यताम्º Fig. *Upamá,*

'The idea is somewhat similar to that of Bishop Butler who calls this a world for man's probation.'—Telang. Hindu writers refer by this to India (the land of Bharata भारतवर्ष) which is the fittest land for the performance of religious rites. It is laid down in Sruti (see Chhánd. Up.) that men repair to the world of the moon &c. to reap the benefits of their meritorious deeds; and when the fund of happiness laid in store there for them is exhausted they come down again to this world of mortals to perform *Karman. Cf*. is..कर्मभूमिभुतेऽस्मिन् भारते

V. 324. तपस्—is used here in a wider sense; as meaning the performance of one's religious duties of all sorts, necessary to elevate one to heaven. The ideaexpressed here is this:–Men, who waste the opportunity of securing heaven (or *Moksha*) by practising *tapas,* given to them by birth in this world, are as foolish as one who &c. The fig. is

 Śl. 107. The moral Mr, Telang draws from his verse is "A man may do the most difficult and dangerous things in order to do what is fated not to happen, or to avoid what is fated to happen. But he will fail." There is no reference in this verse, however, to “*avoiding* what is fated to happen." The verse says that although a man may live into the sea (for pearls or other gems), go to the golden mountain, Meru, conquer enemies in battle, or carry on trade and so forth, no wealth comes to



 him if it is fated not to come (यत्कर्मवशतोऽभाव्यं तन्न भवतीह); for how can that be counteracted which is destined to happen?मज्जतु &c.—*i.e.* for pearls &c. आहव आहूयन्ते अरयोत्र।सकलाः विद्याः—According to some the *vidyas* are three,

 ŚI. 5. पादाक्रान्तम्—(1) covered over with his rays; (2) trodden under the feet, subdued. Mr. Telang thinks that in the latter sense there would seem to be an allusion to the. Vâmana incarnation of Vishnu. स्फार—(from स्फार+रक्Un. 2. 33.) profuse, wide. तेजस—(1) valour; (2) lustre; light. The

figur...*Upamá*, and *Sles'a.*

 SI.6. लज्जा &c.—This is interpreted in three ways:—(1)लज्जा एवगुणः तस्यौध; (2) लज्जादयोयेगुणास्तेषां &c. and ( 3)



 लज्जया ये गुणाः &c.For taking आदिunderstood in (2) there is no authority. (2), though not quite unacceptable, does not seem to be intended. In (1) the word ओघhas hardly any propriety. It is, therefore, better to take it as लज्जा च गुणौघश्च modesty and many other qualities (as Mr. Telang does). अत्यन्तशुद्धहृदयाandअनुवर्तमाना may also be taken with both, प्रतिज्ञा and जननी and interpreted as (1) अत्यन्तं शुद्धं हृदयं यस्यां in which the heart, *i. e.*motive, is pure; (3)...हृदयं यस्याः whose heart is pure; अनु—(1) always going with one, binding: (2) devoted or attached to, lit. always following one. सुखप्तसूनपि—सुखंmay here be taken as a noun in the Acc. (comforts and even life), or as an *adverb,*meaning 'easily, willingly' (and this is preferable being more forcible); *cf*

त्यजन्त्यसुन्शर्म च मानिनो वरं त्यजन्ति न त्वेकमयाचितव्रतम्॥Nai. I. 56; for the former sense comp. स्नेहं दयां च सौख्यं च यदिवा जानकीमपि। आराधनाय लोकानां मुञ्चतो नास्ति में व्यथा ॥Uttar. I 12; for सत्त्यव्रतव्यसन see

slokas 62, 102. The aff. इन् is added for the metre, as a Bah would have expressed the same sense. See note on विगन्धि SI*supr*a. Fig. *Upamá.*

 Śl. 7. The word स्त्रीणां,in the second line, is to be construed with each of the first three lines. स्त्रीणां हृदयमग्राह्यम्—the heart of women cannot be comprehended (lit. seized); अग्राह्य has a twofold sense (1) not to be fathomed &c.; (2) not to be felt or touched by the hand. भाव—Real feeling, inward motive. ‘भावो–भिप्राय आशयः'Yâdava-kosha; see Malli. in his com. on Rag. II. 26. विषम्ः–crcoked or difficult to be perceived like the narrow mountain path. पुष्करपव्रतोयतरलं—acommon expression to denote nusteadiness. आशंसित—is used here for शंसित told, described. नाम—Mr. Telang takes this in the sense of—verily; it may perhaps be taken in the sense of प्रकाश्य—as is well-known.*Cf.* नलिनीदलगतसलिलं तरलं। तद्वज्जीवितमतिशयचपलम्—Mohamudgara.दोषैः समंवर्धिताः—growing with the faults; *i. e.* as the woman grows the faults develop in her. The fig. is *Upama.*

 ŚI. 8. अभिमुख &o–killed with his face towards (not turned away from) the enemy, or in the front line 'For the idea of



 the first line comp. Manus. VII.89. quoted in the com.; also Bg. II. 38. or the following stanza quoted by Madhusûdana Saraswati under Gita I. 31.—द्वाविमौपुरुषो लोके सूर्यमण्डलभेदिनौ।परिवाड्योगयुक्तश्च रणे चाभिमुखो हतः॥ तिष्ठतु तावत्—let that be apart, leave aside all consideration about.*Cf*. तिष्ठतु तावद्भवतो धीरताVik. साधुवादः–praise–साधु इति वादः वचनम्। श्रवणसुखः—श्रवणं सुखयतीति.Leaving aside all considerations of the attainment of heaven or victory, the applause of both the armies is not

aninsignificant gain for a man who falls *wounded* *in the front rank*in *a battle.*

 SI.9

. हयति—of this extent. एतस्मिन्–seems to mean–of thisnature. प्रभवति— stands at the top; appears pre-eminently in thefront. वराह—the third incarnation of Vishnu who lifted up the earth when the demon Hiranyáksha, brother of Hiranyakashipu, was carrying it with him into the depths of the ocean, and killed the demon. The reading दन्तसलिलैःis evidently a misprint occasioned by a copyist's blunder, and so it has been changed to दन्त सलिले. The former hardly gives any sense दन्तमुकुलैः *v.I.*will not do, as the tusks of such Varâha cannot, with any propriety, be compared to *Mukulas*. परः—the other *i. e.* Ráhu. For the allusion see note on शीर्षावशेषीकृतःŚI. 34. The greatness of Varâha consists in lifting up the earth on his tusk; and of Rahu in being generous enough to let go an enemy whom he has. in his clutches. The figures are *Kávyalinga* and *Yathasankhya.*

 ŚI. 10. उदन्वत्—the ocean, उदकानि सन्त्यत्र; from उदक+वत्;उदक is changed to उदन्by‘उदन्वानुदधौ च’।Pån. VIII. 2. 13.सदा पान्थः–ever moving along apath पान्थ is derived as पन्थानंनित्यं गच्छनीति; fr. पथिन् +अ (अणू, पन्थादेशः). The space of the sky, although it may appear extensive.is every day traversed by the sun. कलयति—comprehends, takes the measure of. भावाः—things. स्फुरत्—clear, well-defined.अवधिमुद्रा—boundary-marks.मुकुलिताः—encased, as the flower is in the bud; hence confined, delimited. प्रज्ञोन्मेष—opening, blooming of the intellect, hence its brilliancy. The fig. in this śl. is. *Vyatireka* which is defined



 asउपमानाद्यदन्यस्य व्यतिरेकः स एव सः। There is व्य० when the superiority over the उपमान (the standard of comparison) of what is different from it is mentioned, as that of सतां प्रज्ञोन्मेष overभू&c., here.

 ŚI. 11. The idea of the śl. is that one should make once for all a choice of the alternatives stated and act accordingly;भार्या—प्रियते इति भार्या fr. भृ + य (ण्यत्), भर्तु योग्या वा; he should have the one or the other and nothing between these.

The names are thus given by Amarasimha-ऐरावतः पुण्डरीको वामनःकुमुदोञ्जनः॥पुष्पदन्तः सार्वभौमः सुंप्रतीकश्च दिग्गजाः॥The Ramayans gives them differently, viz. Virupaksha for the East, Saumanasa for the West, Mahapadma for the South, and Bhadra for the North.

 प्रतिपन्न—what is undertaken. अमलमनसाम्—of those whose minds are pure, *i. e*. who never use equivocal language but state in unmistakable terms what they *would* do. It is not clear what the gist of the sl. is. The connection between strong-mindedness and *amalamanasatva* is not very clear. Pro bably the poet expresses here the same idea as he does in the last line of the next sloka.The fig is *Vyatireka.*

 SI. 13. कूर्मस्य—को जले ऊर्मिः वेगो अस्य। A tortoise. Here the second incarnation of Vishnu. Mr. Telang reads the third line asकिं त्वङ्गीº—न्नमनसा, suggesting that the line should be taken as a question and that for this it would be better to read किं चाङ्गीकृतम्, and further remarks—"The reading किंतु is more appropriate to what I think is the intended sense, but to obtain that न must be got rid of."But the third line makes a general statement and supports the figure in the line, while the questions in the first two lines refer to specific objects. निर्वाहः&c.—construe सतामेतद्धि गोत्रव्रतं (यत्) प्रतिपन्नवस्तुषु निर्वाहः।व्रत—



An observance that is binding. The s'loka occurs in Mud.II. The fig. is *Arthántaranyása.*

 SI. 14. पिण्ड—a ball of rice. *cf*. 'ननु पश्य आश्वासितः पिशाचोपिभोजनेन'।Vik. II. This metaphorically means 'when bribed.'मृदङ्ग—Tabors were originally made of earth. मुखलेपेन—refers to the practice of applying kneaded flour to a

The Dat. isतादर्थ्येby the Vart. तादर्थ्येचतुर्थी वाच्या। The cloud is mentioned here as the type of सत्.

 ŚI.16. In this sl. a minister and a poot are described as having a similar function to do by epithets which are *slishta.*दुरात्—(1) from afar; may also be metaphorical; (2) far apart*i.e*, by using words in a *slishta* or secondary (लाक्षणिक) sense; by presenting a striking picture to the mind far beyond the conception of ordinary men.अर्थ—(1) wealth or a political end; (2) the intended sense. अपशद्वं त्यक्त्वा—Avoiding wrangling; or offensive words; or take the whole as चापशद्वंthe twanging sound of the bow *i, e*, achieving lofty aims by a wise stroke of policy without having recourse to war.; (2) faulty or offensive expressions, wrong words. सप्तभा—(1) assemblies of good (or politically clever) people, political bodies; (2) assemblies of learned (able to appreciate) सदृश्य men पदम्—(1) step; (2) words. लोकचित—(1) by consulting public opinion; (2) by going along with the current of ideas and conforming to the



 tastes of his times. For a similar comparison between a minister and a poet, see Mud. IV. 2; Śis. XI.6.

 ŚI.18. कन्दुकपातेन—a curious phrase probably used for the metre; the regular one would be कन्दुकपातं पतति,in the manner of the fall of a ball *i. e*. to rise again.केन तुल्यं कन्दुकपातेन कन्दुकपावत् यथा कन्दुकः पतन्नुत्पतति।Rámarshi. *Cf*. प्रायेण साधुवृत्तानां &c.*supra* sl.

S6. आर्यः—An honourable man, a man of merit.मृत्पिण्ड–a lump of clay, which remains sticking to the ground and never rises up.

 ŚI. 20. मदभिन्न V. I.—In this case गण्ड must be taken in the sense of cheeks, and करट the frontal globes, निद्रालसाः—dull with the nightly sleep. वीणा &c.—For the idea expressed here, comp.

See Apte's Guide. § 25. The fig. is *Udâtta* which is described as उदात्तं वस्तुनः संपत्the description of the excellence of a thing.

 Sl. 21. परोपकारित्वम्— परस्य उपकरोतीनि परोपकारी तस्य भावः। त्रितयम्।See com. and Pán. V. 2. 42. quoted therein.

 SI. 22. गजाङ्गनाया *V.I*.—गजस्य इव अङ्गनं गमनं यस्याः; with the gait of an elephant; hence a beautiful woman. If the reading



 be कटे, गजाङ्गना would mean afemale elephant; protuberant temples being regarded as a mark of ugliness in her case. The reading लज्जाङ्गनायाः &c. is better; it also explains the force of च.शीलं &o.—*Cf*. सर्वेषामपि सर्वकारणमिदं शीलं परं भूषणम्।ŚI. 87, above.

 ŚI. 23. प्रियº–सख *v.I.*, for readings see next p., foot notes.विपद्दण्ड &c.—प्रपात is preferable to प्रताप which requires a straining.अत्र—In this case or in this world. Fig. *Upama*.The mind is here identified with clay, fate with a potter, anxiety with his wheel, and calamities with his rod. Fate whirls the minds of men by causing them anxiety and plunging them into misery.

 SI. 24. विरसः—painful, disagreenble on account of constant disappointment. आवास—an effort accompanied with bodily or mental trouble. अध्यवसाय—a resolute undertaking. दुरध्यवसायmeans here ‘a foolish attempt.'विपदि &c.—*Cf*.'दर्शितभयेपि धातारिधैर्यध्वंसो भवेन्न धीराणाम्'। कल्पापायें—कल्पेयः अपायः destruction of every thing तरिमन्सति। This corresponds to 'विपाद' in the case of the mahats. व्यपेतनिजक्रमाः—who depart from their usual course, viz. (1) remaining firm and supporting the earth: and (2) keeping within proper limits. Men truly great are notव्यपेतनिजक्रम in विपद् but the mountains and the oceans are. Thus the former are superior even to the latter. कुलशिखरिणः— see note on कुलपर्वत mis.sI.12. क्षुद्राः–*mean*, and not *'small'.*Mr. Telang says—"I, however, prefer कल्यापायेपि अव्यपेतनिजक्रमा एते कुल शिखरिणः क्षुद्रा न भवन्ति न देते जलराशयः. It may also do to take it as कल्पापायेपिकुलशिखरिणः व्यपेतनिजक्रमाः क्षुद्राश्व(भवन्ति) न यैते जलराशयः।" Rāmarshi's comment runs as follows:–एतेमहान्तः क्षुद्राः लघवः (

sc.) कुलशिखरिणः कुलपर्वताः न भवन्ति । अथवा एते जलराशयःसमुद्रा न। किंभूताः क्षुद्राः लघवः । पुनः किंलक्षणाः उभये कल्पापाये कल्पस्यअपायोन्तः तस्मिन् व्यपेतनिजक्रमाः व्यपेतः गतः निजक्रमो गुरुत्वगाम्भीर्यादिः येषां ते तथा. The ides of the stanza, as explained by us, is a common one. Comp. Kir. XI. 54, and still better because more closely alike is Viracbarita p.110 (Trith.) "न कम्पन्ते झञ्झामरूति किल वाति प्रतिदिशम्। समुन्मूच्छंसाराः कुलशिखरिणः किंचिदपि



 ते। न मर्यादां तेपि प्रतिजहति गाम्भीर्यगरिमस्फुरद्वर्ब्रह्माणोकलितमहिमानोम्बुनिधयः।" It will be seen, however, that Rámarshi's explanation is more to the point, as already explained by us above.*cf*. Bhāg. P. VIII. 24. Mr. Joglekar quotee–गिरयो गुरवस्तेभ्योऽप्युर्वी गुर्वी ततोति जगदण्डम्। तस्मादप्यतिगुरवः प्रलयेप्यचला महात्मानः॥Bhäm. Vil. I. The fig. is *Vyatireka;*see mis. SI.10.

 ŚI.25. स्पृहयति–स्पृह generally governs the Dative but when there is ardent longing or a strong desire, it governs the Acc.;प्रकर्षविवक्षायां तु परत्वात्कर्मसंज्ञा। पुष्पाणि स्पृहयति।Sid. Kau. भुजयोरन्तरम्–The space between the arms,*i.c*.the chest. करवालकररुह—applies to श्री and वनिता; (1) करवालः कररुह इव the nail-like sword. (2) आयताः करवाल इव कररुहाः long nails piercing like a sword. For the idea of the nail-marks inflicted by lovers on the bodies of their beloveds, comp. सद्यो बसन्तेन समागतानां नखक्षतानीव वनस्थलीनाम्॥ Kum..

 ŚI. 2. The poet herein gives three causes of the decadence of learning—first, learned men themselves do not encourage it being jealous of new aspirants for literary honours; secondly, wealthy men in their own self-sufficiency despise knowledge; and lastly, ignorant men do not encourage it because they cannot appreciate it. प्रभवः—the great, the richअबोधोपहताः—Lit. smitten by ignorance or want of understanding; incapable of appreciating merits. जीर्ण—p. p. ofजु, absorbed; see *infra*. sl. 84 and*cf*.

The meaning is—being an unwelcome guest at the house of strangers I was afraid they might at any moment drive me away just as people drive away a crow. Mr. Telang puts on this a different interpretation. He says.—"The fear, however, would rather seem to be the fear of being seen by others eating at the house of a stranger." There is no warrant, however, to take the word stranger to mean a *person of a* *different caste.*जृम्भसि—The Faras. is for the metre; it should be जृम्भसे जृम्भto gape, increase, grow strong. Råmarshi takes पापकर्मनिरता as a Bah. dissolving it as पापकर्मणि निरतः पुमान् यथा ( हेतुभूतया) साbut this is ungrammatical.

 ŚI. 5. उल्लपाः—taunting words. आराधन—humouring; pleasing. शुन्येन मनसा–with a vacant mind; though my mind was not *sympathetic*. Some construeas (खलानां) हसितमपि शुन्येनकार्याकार्यविचारशून्येन मनसा सोढं; but this is rather farfetched and is not so forcible. चित्तस्तम्भः कृतः—(my mind revolted against these things but) I controlled my temper. प्रतिहतधियां (तान् प्रतीत्यर्थः।) of blunted faculties, senseless, wicked. मोघासो–मोघा आशायस्याः, तत्सम्बुद्धिः (O greed), of fruitlees expectations नर्तयसि—To incite to something bad. A derivative of this word is sometimes used in a similar sense in Marathi (नाचवर्णे).  
 ŚI. 6. तुलितº—this comparison is very common. *Cf*. नलिनीदलगतजलमतितरलं तद्वज्जीवितमतिशयचपलं Moh. M.5. कृते goes withप्राणानाम्; आढ्य arich man; derived from आ+ध्ये+क,पृषोदरादि०निजगुण०—self-praise is forbidden, and is therefore considered to be a sin. *Cf.*ब्रुवते हि फलेन साधवो न तु कण्ठेन निजोपयोगिताम्। Nai.

 fore, we could not claim the merit of saints, though we did not enjoy pleasures. सोढाः—We had to put up with the inclemencies of the weather &c. on account of poverty (as Rámarshi suggests) but that does not entitle us to the merit of penance.ध्यातं—We were engaged in contemplation, not of the feet of Śiva but of wealth. Thus though we did the same actions that are done by sages, viz. forgiving, renunciation, endurance, and contemplation as to the fruits of those actions we have been deceived. We went the wrong way, and hence our disappointment. For नियमितप्राणैर्न शम्भोः परं *cf.*अन्तयंश्च मुमुक्षुभिर्नियमितप्राणादिभिर्मृग्यतेVik. I. 1. The fig. is *Vis'eshokti*.

 SI.8. वयमेव भुक्ताः—desire (which was never satisfied) haspreyed on our minds (likecanker on a bud) Some supply कालेनbut that idea is expressed in याताः तप्ताः—*i. e.* with cares and anxieties.वयमेव याताः—our bodies have been wasted away; or it is we (men) that have had our *exits*. In popular language we say that time passes; but really speaking it is not time that passes: time is

eternal; but

we have our exits from this world. तृष्णा न जीर्णा— *cf*. next sl. ºजीर्णा fr weakened by old age.

 SI. 9. All parts of the body indicate the advent of old age. Greed alone grows young. *i. e,* though old we feel as greedy as when we were young, or even more. आक्रान्तं—Over-ridden; on which a footing has been made by. पलितं—gray hair; 'पलितं जरसाशौक्ल्यं'Amara. तृष्णा—here may also be taken as an उपलक्षण*i.c*. indicating kindred things—the feelings of the mind.तरुणायते—तरुणी इवाचरति is young *Cf*. जीर्यन्ते जीर्यतः केशा दन्ता जीर्यन्ति जीर्यतः। जीर्यतश्चक्षुषी श्रोत्रे तृष्णैका तरुणायते Pt. V. 16.

 SI. 10. पुरुषबहुमानः—Rámarshi explains this as equivalent to पुरुषसम्बन्धी पुरुषाणां यूनांयो भवतीत्यर्थः, which is equivalent to पुरुपत्वाविषयकः another way is to take it as पुरुषेषु बहुमानः respect among men. The first is preferable. समानः—of equal age or rank; contemporary. जीवितसमाः–equal to life, valued or esteemed as life itself. The other interpretation placed on this viz.जीवितं समं पूर्णंयेषां can hardly be acceptable. स्वर्—The word is an



 indeclinable ('स्वरव्ययं' Amara.) and has generally the sense. of the Acc. or Loc. It is compounded with certain nouns as,स्वर्ग, स्वर्णदी, स्वाराट् (स्वर्+राट्र) &c.धृष्टः—impudent, shameless (निर्लज्ज). The fig. of speech is *Vibhávaná.*

 SI.12. संसारोत्पन्नं चरितम्—The course of life in this world, incidents of worldly life.अनुपश्यामि—To expect something good out of, to see in prospect; c*f.*न च श्रेयोनुपश्यामि Bhag.

Sat. 89. चिरपरिगृहिताः–(1) enjoyed for a long time, or (2) enjoyed after a long time, as Râmarshi takes it. The former is, however, preferable; as long enjoyment is required to make a man attached to worldly pleasures. which is implied in the succeeding line. महान्तो जायन्ते—become big; assume large proportions; hence tempt men by their magnitude. व्यसनं दातुमिव—their object in assuming big proportions and tempting men away from *Moksha* being as it were to make men happy. The more a man clings to pleasures the more miserable he becomes; for he is always disappointed; o*f*. न जातु कामःकामानामुपभोगेन शाम्यति। हविषा कृष्णवर्त्मेव भूय एवाभिवर्धते॥ Manu. II. 91. Or व्यसनmay mean calamity; the fondness for enjoyments throws them into the turmoil of embodied existence; see com. and *infra.* s'l. 46. notes. विषयिणां—and not to विरागिनांwho at once renounce them and become happy.

 ŚI. 13. चिरतरमुषित्वापि—even after staying long. वियोगे–is here used in the sense of 'the vanishing of pleasures,' and is



 explained by the words ब्रजतः स्वातन्त्र्यात् below. स्वयम्—of one's own motion, voluntarily. परितापाय—mark the sense of परि; they trouble in every way. शमसुखम्—शम is the same as शान्ति; comp.विहाय कामान्यः सर्वान्पुमांश्चरति निस्पृहः। निर्ममो निरहङ्कारः स शान्तिमाधिगच्छति॥Bg. II. 71; also 70, 72. It is not used in its technical Vedantic sense here (for which see

Mis. śl. 2).

 ŚI. 15. शकुनाः—birds. अङ्केशयाः—an *Aluka* Comp. मनोरथ&c.—for the different ways of dissolving the comp. see com. मनोरथोप०—a palace built in the mind &c.;*i. e.* building castles in the air.

 SI. 16. भिक्षाशनं—भिक्षया अशनं livelihood; or भिक्ष्यते इति भिक्षा(food obtained by begging), fr. भिक्ष्+आ; तस्या अशनंeating, maintenance on. तदीय—also goes with एकवारं, even the coarse food is to be had for but one meal; it is not sufficient for the two meals in the day. न जहाति—In spite of abject poverty attachmento worldly objects does not die out.विषया न परित्यजन्ति*v.I*.–in this case some such words asअस्मान् must be supplied. But this reading loses force since there is no beauty in saying that the pleasures do not leave

us. It is the mind that must relinquish them. Hence the reading adopted in the text is preferable.

 ŚI. 17. कविजनविशेषैः—byparticular

poets.गुरुकृतम्—magnified, praised, made much of.

 ŚI. 18. रागिन्—one in the power of love, an amorousperson.प्रियतमा०—Siva and Pârvati form together but one body the right half being male and the left one being female. *Cf*. देहद्वयार्धघटनारचितं शरीरमेकं ययोः&c. Intro. ślokas; to Kád. Pt. II.



 नीरागेषु—Siva, though the greatest of lover, is also greater than the greatest of those who have renounced the world; for he only could do the two opposite things,viz,toyield to the influence of love so far as to allow his wife to share half of his body and also to resist successfully the action of the shafts of Kâma which are irresistible (दुर्बरि) to others. *Cf*. न राागिचेतःपरमा विलासिता वधूः शरीरेऽस्ति न चास्ति मन्मथः । Kir. XVIII. 31.विभूषणोद्भासि पिनद्धभोगि वा गजाजिनालम्बि दुकूलघारि वा । कपालिवा स्यादथवेन्दुशेखरं न विश्वमूर्तेरवधार्यते वपुः॥ Kum. V. 73,व्याविद्धमुग्ध—lying in a stupor, the poison having pervaded the body. शेषः—other than śiva. Ordinary people never enjoy pleasures (as they would do, for they are only

कामविडाम्बित) and also are not able to renounce them.  
 ŚI. 19. For महात्म्यम् some read दाहात्म्यन् which is enquivalent lentto दाहात्मकनाम्—power to burn. माहात्म्यम् can also be easily understood from the context to mean the same thing. वडिशयुतम्— to which a fish-hook is attached. 'बडिशं मत्स्यवेधनम्'।Amara. The moth and the fish are not gifted with the faculty of discernment and they cannot perceive danger, but men, reasoning beingsthat they are, are ruined by their desires. जटिल–intertwined, complicated. गहनः—inscrutable, mysterious.

 ŚI. 20. बलित—mixed with. प्रतीकारो व्याधेः सुखम्–The removal of pain is happiness. Really, there is no such thing as happiness says the poet. What is felt to be as such is merely on account of the pain being removed. विपर्यस्यतिwrongly thinks; see com.

 SI. 21. तुङ्गं &c.–

These, singly or together. कल्याणी–कल्यंनीरुजत्वमाणयतीति; fortunate: *cf*. त्वमेव कल्याणि तयोस्तृतीया । Rag. VI. 29. निविशते-sticks fondly or closely to; विश्with नि is Atm. 'निर्विशः'Pán. I. 3. 17.संसारकारागृह–कारागृह of course to a philosopher.धन्यः &c.—यः सन्न्यस्यति स धन्यः। सन्नास means abandoning all desires. *Cf*. काम्याणां कर्मणां न्यासं सन्नासं कवयो विदुः Bg. XVIII, 2.

 ŚI. 22. The adjectives in the first two lines require to be distributed between शिशुकैःand गेहिनीaccording as they are in



 the Instr.or the Nom. शिशुकैः—शिशव एव शिशुकाः क expresses pity. विधुरा—miserable (दीना), derived as विगता धुः कार्यभारो यस्याः Lit.having nothing to do; hence perplexed, as a loss to know what to do. गद्गद &c.—Avy. Comp. दग्धजठरस्यार्थे–for the sake of the accursed stomach. The word दग्ध is often used in the sense it has here. *Cf.* अस्य दग्धोदरस्यार्थे कः कुर्यात्पातकं महत्। Hit. I. See notes on Nit. Sat. śl. 99. मनस्वीa high-souled person; see Nit.śl. 33.  
 SI. 23. अभिमत०—highly valued. The demands of the stomach make one completely forago allself-respect.गुरुतर—nobier; higher.ग्राम—a collection. अम्भोज—the water–lily that blooms at sunrise, but fades when the moon rises. *Cf.* कुमुदवनमपश्रिश्रीमदम्भोजखण्डं–Sis. XI. 64. where the sun rise is described. The moon-light-like जठरपिठरी makes the lotuses of virtues fade away. विपुलº–विपुला (विपुलंयथा तथा वा) विलसन्ती या &c. कुठारिकाa small hatchet. पिठरी—a pan or boiler.

 SI. 24. पाली—the edge, सित् &c.—The edge of which is covered with a piece of white cloth. कपाली—a broken pot.न्याय—&c. नयन्ति परमं पदं प्रापयन्ति विवेकेनेतिन्यायाः श्रुतिशास्त्रस्मृत्यादयःsays Rámarshi. The meaning here is 'the formulaor systems manifested in the three Vedas'; the proper method of performing (sacrifices). So this meansऋतुमन्त्रविनियोगविधिज्ञाः Malli. commenting on Kum. II. 12 says
नीयन्त एभिरर्थविशेषा इतिन्यायाः स्वरास्तैरुदात्तानुदात्तस्वरितः। This meaning will also do here—the Vedas pronounced correctly (with proper intonation and accent.) धूम्र—of a smoky colour, blackened. उपकण्ठम्—the adjacent part. द्वारं द्वारं प्रभृतः—going to every door. वरम्—an

indecl

. expressing preference, and used with the clause containing the thing preferred (which is put in the Nom. case). See Apte's Guide § 301.

 तुल्यकल्येषु—कुले भवाः fr. कुल्याः fr. कुल+यत् (य) by 'दिगादिभ्यो'यत् Pan. IV. 3. 54, कुल being a synonym of वंश. कुल्यःकुलोद्भवेःमान्ये कुलस्यातिहितोपि च। Visva. The sense intended by the poet, however, is तुल्यं च तत् कुलं तुल्यकुलं तत्र भवाः।But this is inadmissible from a grammatical point of view. भवार्थे यत् is to be



 to simple words, and not to compounds. Vâmana remarks—भवार्थे पुनर्दिगादिपाठेपि वंशशद्वस्य वंशशद्वादेव तत्र प्रत्ययः। ग्रहणवता प्रातिपदिकेन तदन्तविधेः प्रतिषेधात्।The form may be defended by explaining it as तुल्यकुले साधवः, यत् being affixed by 'तत्र साधुः’Pân. IV. 4. 98.

 ŚI.25. हिमº—कणशीकर *v.I.* here कण meansmeans a drop andशीकर spray. हिमवतः स्थानानि—retreats in the Himálayas, the favourite haunts of ascetics. सावमान&c.—see com.; given with, accompanied by, indignities; or सावमानं यथा स्यात्तथाwith humiliation. रताः—take pleasure in.

 SI. 26. कन्दर—the slopes between two hills; see śl. 79. प्रसभं—प्रगता सभा विचारोऽस्मात् तद्यथा तथा।. foreibly*i.e.*against one's thoughts, or wishes. This may also be taken with अपगतº. प्रश्रय—courtesy, courteous behaviour.‘ प्रश्रयप्रणयौ समौ’ Amara. The last line is *adj*. to मुखानि. लतानि—This refers to the eyebrows of men proud of their wealth which are sometimes raised, at others wrinkled. *Cf.*Bhág. II. 2-5.quoted in the com., reading the 3rd and 4th lines as रुद्धा गुहाः किमजितोऽवति नोपसन्नान्कस्माद्रजन्ति &c.

 ŚI. 27. The reading has been adopted in this Ed. instead of प्रिये,as *Mas*, Vocatives often occur, while a female is rarely addressed in this Sitaka. प्रणयिनिviolates the metre. प्रणयिनीं—must be taken with वृत्तिsomehow. Another reading is प्रियैश्चसलिलैः; but this, too, is not satisfactory, as there is no propriety of प्रियैः. अकरुण *v.I*.—not pleasing, harsh to the touch; rough. यामःis replaced by यावः which is found in one Ed.ईश्वराणां—goes with नामापि and means 'of rich people';*cf.* (Mis. śl. 11.) वित्त &c.—विकाराsuch as rudeness, vanity &c. Mr. Telang's reading is चित्तव्यधिwhich is redundant as we have already got विवेकामूढ. For the idea *cf*. Mis. sl. 32.   

 ŚI.28. प्रतिवानम्—in every forest. अखेदम—an *adj*. (Bah. Comp.) o*r adv.* For the idea expressed here comp. *infra*. śl. 55.

 SI. 29. वर्धन्ते—appear long. The man who has the misery to supplicate the rich, often in vain, finds the days very long.



 आक्षेपmeans allurement or distraction; one commentary explains it also as आदर. पर्यस्त—lit. tossed about; hence distracted. अल्पत्वंदधति—the man engaged in the pursuit of worldly objects finds. time too short to achieve all his ends. वासराणां the Gen. by'अधीगर्थदयेशां कर्मणी 'Pap. II. 3. 52. ध्यानच्छेदे—ध्यान is defined by Patañjali asप्रत्ययैकतानता (sameness of preception; see com. śl. 99). ध्यानम्—(1) at the end of my contemplation; and (2) during the interval between two समाधि.The idea is this—After I shall have broken my समाधि, I shall smile at the life of misery led by worldly people.May the time come when I shall be free from desire and renouncing the world enjoy the happinees of समाधि.

 SI. 30. सन्तोषº—सन्तोषेण निरन्तरंalways or greatly, highlyप्रमुदिताः—delighted. Mr. Telang reads सन्तोषसुखप्रमोदमुदिताः but we do not see the propriety of प्रमोद and मुदितwhich mean the same thing.भिन्नाः—interrupted, unaltered; they enjoy unmixed felicity (not affected by the report about the treasures of Meru). The joys of ordinary men are often interrupted by misfortunes, the thwarting of their desires &c.हता—mark the contrast. The happiness of the one never comes to an end; the thirst of the other never ends and makes him perpetually miserable. इत्थं &c.—The sentence ends with मेरुः;supply सः or एतद्विधेः कृत्यंas Nom. to रोचते. This indicates Vairágya, and so the śl. is in its proper place here. The idea seems to be this–A sane person never does any thing without some motive. But it is difficult to see what the motive of Brahmawas in creating Meru. Those who are self-contented have nothing to do with it. If the object be to gratify the lust for money of avaricious. persons, Meru, with its unending treasures, can never fulfil it.“Śârngadhara p. 23 ascribes this to Vidyapati." Mr. Telang.

 ŚI. 31. अदैन्य–in which there is no self-abasement; in which one has not the misery of undergoing humiliation, or making abject supplication.अप्रतिसुखं—This reading is better thanअप्रतिहतंas it nearly means the same thing as अवार्य. अप्रतिहत may mean knowing no obstruction, producing every desired effect...



 भीतिच्छद—*v.I.* shielding (lit. covering) from fear. अभिमान—may also mean 'egotism.' अन्वहं—day after day, always.साधुप्रियं— may also be taken as साधु च तत् प्रियं च।सत्रम्–सीदन्त्यत्रfr. सद्+ष्टन् (त्र). Un. IV. 159. That in which people sit down to worship or contemplate; hence here worship or the system of worship; it may have here the same meaning as that of संप्रदायor the course of life adopted by the devotees of Siva, अवार्य—If the reading अप्रतिहतbe adopted in the first line this should be taken to mean that cannot be opposed *i. e*. made to give way by being proved inferior. Mr, Telang who does not understand the word अबार्य in this sense suggests that अप्रतिसुखं should be preferred to अप्रतिहतम्. अवार्य mey also be taken with अक्षयनिधिम् as we have done in translating.  
 SI. 32. कुले—कुलis here used in the same way as 'birth' in English, in the sense of 'noble birth'. The reading मीने for मानेin 1. 2. is not to be preferred; because मौन byitself is a blemish and cannot be linked with other good things mentioned in the verse; secondly, all the expressions indicating danger are predicated as directly producing evil effects on the objects named while no direct effect can be produced on मौन by the fear of being considered spiritless. There is therefore a want of symmetry if we accept the reading मौनैinstead of माने. If we takeमौन its Vedautic sense of 'reticense' it will be inappropriate, as Mr. Joglekar remarks, to link it with other material things so opposed to asceticism. गुणे—comp. न दुर्जनानामिह कोपिदोषस्तेषां स्वभावो हि गुणासहिष्णुः ।Vikrámnga. I. 20.

 ŚI. 33. आक्रान्तं—is more forcible than आघ्रातं.It must be taken with the following expressions also. अत्युज्ज्वलं—this breaks the symmetry as it is the only *adj*. used to qualify one. of the several things stated in the śl. विभ्रम्—Sportive movements, amorous actions. अस्यैर्येण विभूतयः—affluence (marred) by inconstancy. उपहृता—उपहृता *v.I*does not make good sense.

 ŚI. 34. आधि—mental torment, anxiety. व्याधि—bodily ailment, disease.विवृतद्वाराः—may also be taken as विवृतं द्वारमासां



 to which a door has been opened, for which an entrance is. effected. जातं जातम्—every born being विवश—helplessआत्मसात् करोति—takes entirely in his custody. आत्मसात्—in one's possession. 'तदधीनवचने' (Pan V. 4 64.) सातिः स्यात्The aff. सात् is added to express possession and used with a form of the roots, कृ, भू or अम् or संपद. नाम—indeed, I should like to know; *cf*. तत्को नाम गुणो भवेत् स गुणिनां&c. Nit. Śat. śl. 54. सुस्थितम् *v.I.—*Standing well or firmly, secure, safe.

 ŚI. 35. तुङ्ग—This adds to the चपलत्व. भङ्ग—Mr. Telang translates this by 'breaking' preferring it to its usual sense of'रचना' (the waves rising in succession) but we think the sense of रचना is more poetical and better as it corresponds to भोग,the idea of breaking or vanishing being left to be implied.दिनानि—The Acc. by'कालाध्वनोरत्यन्तसंयोगे'Pan II. 3. 5.बोधकाःसन्तः—being instructors of people. The word has no special propriety here; it seems to be for alliteration. पेशल—may also mean चारुbeautiful, the चारुत्व lying in its excellence'चारौ दक्षे च पेशलः'Amara. यत्नः—effort; may mean an effort to lead. people to *Moksha* or may simply refer to the transactions of daily life. *Cf.* Bg. III. 21 quoted in the com.

 SI.36. वितानं—lit, expansion; a canopy; hence a collection or mass spread all round. सौदामिनी—lightning सुदाग्निमेघे भवाः; fr. सुदामन्a cloud and अण्. भङ्गुरन्—frail, liable to speedy dissolution; from भञ्ज+घुरच् (उर) see com.यौवनलालना—The indulgences of youth, youthful happiness. Râmarshi explains.लालना by धारणा, and snother commentary by अतिपालनाः but neither of these is satisfactory. लालसा *v.I.*—the ardent desire for pleasures which youth begets. योगे—योग seems to be used here in the sense of Union with, or manifestation in contemplation of, the Supreme Spirit. Its usual meaning is चित्तवृत्तिनिरोधः 'controlling the functions of the mind,'by means of which the individual soul can be in complete union with the supreme Soul. धैर्यसमाधि &c.–धैर्येण (by patience) या समाधिसिद्धिःsuccess in the acquisition of the Samidhi by patient contempla–



 tion. Or Samadhi may simply mean a state of equanimity not allowing the mind to be ruffled or agitated under any circumstances. Some take the Comp. as धैर्यं च समाधिश्च ताभ्यां, but without propriety. The reading ध्येयसमाधि presents no difficulty. Samadhi is the last and the most perfect stage of meditation, the eight stages being यमनियमासनप्राणायामप्रत्याहार-धारणाध्यानसमाधयोष्टावङ्गानि। विधद्ध्वं 2nd. pers. pl.Imper. of घा with वि.बुद्धिं विधद्ध्वं—From your inclination towards, fix your mind on. The figures are *Upamá* and *Kávyalinga,*

 ŚI. 37. कल्लोल—a large wave. ०कल्पाः—momentary, transient like thought; कल्पsignifies a little less than, almost equal to.ईषदसमाप्तौकल्पप्देश्यदेशीयरः—Pán. V. 3. 67. घन &c.—विभ्रमाःquick motions,flashes उपगूढम् *subs. embrace;* derived from गुह्with उप + त (नपुंसके भावे त्त्कः). प्रणीतम्—कृतम् Fig. *Kavyalinga.*

 Śl. 38. कृच्छे्ण—with great difficulty: modifies स्थीयते. तनुभिः—ऋतुभिः*v. I.* गर्भवासे—०

गर्ते*v. I.*अमेध्य—unfit for sacrifice; henge impure, dirty. नियमित—regulated by boundaries; hence confined in a limited area; pent up. गर्भवासे—गर्भस्य वासःthe womb.व्यतिकर—means सम्बन्ध orमिश्रण, and may be translated by 'on account of.' उपभोगः—विप्रयोगः *v.I*. will not do, as it means the same thing as बिश्लेष (separation) which has already occurred. नारीणाम् &c.—This is taken by some with the second line; it is, however, preferable to take the third line as one assertion;नारीणामप्यवज्ञा being the reason why old age is an evil. Râmarshi supports this view. For construction see com.बामाक्षीणामवज्ञा०*v.I.—*अवज्ञया विहसितानि तेषां वसतिः.

 SI. 39. परितर्जयन्ती—threatening.देहं प्रहरन्ति—The use of the Loc. with ag is more usual and idiomatic;*cf.*रुद्रौजसा तु प्रहृतं त्वयास्यां;and तस्मिन्प्रजहुर्युधि सर्व एव Rag. II.54 and VII. 59;न प्रहर्तुमनागसि Sak. I11., for Acc. see. Rag. V 58. परिस्रवति—oozes out, gently disappears. अहितमाचरति—(people) do injury to themselves, by doing evil deeds, (*i. e.* do not try to obtain*Moksha* ). Fig. *Upamá.*



 Śl. 40. भङ्गुरवृत्तयः—evanescent or transient by nature. तैरेव चायं भवः—And wordly life (is formed) of them only. कृतम्—enough with. मसाधीयताम्—fix in one place. कामोच्छित्तिवशे–which is (now) under control on account of desires being uprooted.स्वधामनि—in its own place or abode, viz.स्वयंप्रकाशे आत्मनि.

 SI. 41.तृणलव०—of as little consequence as a small blade of grass.यस्मिन्महाशासने—*V. I.* Some such words as लब्धे orअधिगते सति should be taken as understood after this Locative.महाशासने &c.—The knowledge of Brahma as expounded in the Upanishads; the highest truth taught by them (the four Mabâvâkyas especially); Râmarshi explains this by परमात्मज्ञाने(स्फुरिते सति). Mr. Telang says—"It means whose commands are great; thus in the Upanishads एतस्या वा अक्षरस्य गार्गि प्रशासने सूर्याचन्द्रमसौतिष्ठतः।or भीषाऽस्माद्वातः पवते &c.; the greatness consisting in the great powers which obey those commands."But Rámarshi's sense seems to be more natural. The knowledge of Brahma is called *Mahásásana* because it comes authoritatively from the Vedas, it being the highest truth taught by them.कोऽपि—indescribable. *Cf*. विकारः कोप्यन्तर्जदयति च तापं च कुरुते,Uttar. नित्योदित—ever existing, steady, permanent. *Cf*. with this sl. 70 *infra*.; Gita VI. 22.

 SI. 42. रम्या सा would be better for symmetry सामन्त (सम्यगन्तः समन्तः border, frontier. तत्र भवः सामन्तः) means a frontier king, a tributary prince. विदग्ध—a wise man.सापि राजपरिषद्*v.I.*involves tautology since सामन्तचक्र has already occurred. उत्सिक्तः— swollen or puffed up with pride, proud. उद्रेक *V. I.* (p. p of रिच्with उत्) lit. exceeded, overflowed, hence haughty. निवह—a collection. स्मृतिपथमगात–became a matter of memory *i. e.*history.

 Śl. 43. गृहे—used here in a double sense; (1) a house; (2) a square on a dice-board. तदनु बहवः—(And there are) many after him *i.e*. many who follow or depend upon him. The last two lines describe the game at dice in which the god of death and his wife (the male and female personifications of the principle of Destruction) are engaged. The world is their dice-board,



 mortals the dice-pieces (शार Marathi सोंगट्या,) and day and night the two dice. Śiva may also he regarded as the Destroyer as he is described in the Puranas as playing at dice with his wife, Pârvati.

 ŚI. 44. व्यापारैः—avocations, affairs. गुरु—momentous, weighty. कालः—Time, *i. e,* the passing away of time. त्रासः—fear or disgust. जन्म &c.—a Comp. of the समाहारद्वंद्व class.मौहमयीं–मोहप्रचुरां the aff. मयis used in the sense of 'excess' (or made of). मदिरा—derived from मद+किरच्(इर) + टाप्(आ)—that which intoxicates. उन्मत्तभुतम्—उन्मत्तं भूतं;there is nospecial propriety of taking भूत् in the sense of इव.The poet makes a definite assertion here.

 ŚI. 45. निभृतम्—resolutely, steadily, or secretly. पुनरुक्त—*i. e.* repeatedly enjoyed, hence stale. कदर्थिताः—disgraced; or tormented. See Nît. Sat. śl. 84; and *infra. कदरानम्*Mis śl, 29.

 ŚI. 46. संसारविच्छित्ति—Cutting asunder, or utter destruction, of the bonds of संसार, leading to *Moksha* (salvation or unification with the Supreme Being). This is attained by means of *Yoga* and then there is no re-birth for man. This is the highest ideal, the next one is स्वर्ग. This is attained by means of religious merit, vows, sacrifices, &c; see com. The reward for these is स्वर्ग, and after the heavenly happiness is enjoyed for the prescribed term, there is again re-birth, again the acquisition of स्वर्ग by religious merit, again re-birth, and so no till the end of the creation. धर्मः—see com. The student can easily see the difference between संसारविच्छित्ति and स्वर्गप्राप्ति.In the eyes of a philosopher, the latter is nothing (तुच्छ) as compared to the former. रामा०—This refers to the third object of human pursuit, viz.काम or the enjoyment of worldly pleasures. यौवनवन—Not a happy metaphor, as वन expresses a plurality of ideas. It is probably used for alliteration the poet may seem to refer by *Vana* to an avenue of trees which gradually disappears as tree after tree is cut down and so to refer to the gradual disappearance of youth. वयम्—The plural is used to indicate self-disparagement.



 ŚI. 47. वादि &c.—Mr. Telang proposes that this *adj.* andविनीतोचिता should denote two kinds of learning and quotes the*Subhâshita* विद्या विवादाय धनं मदाय &c. to support his position. There, however, two kinds of persons are specially mentioned as possessing two kinds of learning. Here we have no mention made of two persons of different temperaments as in the*Subhashita;* but the *adj*. विनीतोचिता seems to have been purposely added to signify that the kind of learning meant here is not
that which falls under the category (खलस्य) विद्या विवादाय.High learning is *capable* of putting down an antagonist, but it need not at the same time be

pronsto controversy when it is possessed by good men. करिकुम्भ°—*i.e.*the elephants of the enemy. तारुण्य—which is the fittest period of life for achieving the three things mentioned in the foregone lines.

 ŚI. 48. शुश्रुषा—properly desire to hear; hence 'service, attendance.'समाहितं—सम्यक् आहितं firmly placed, concentrated, devoted. पित्रोः—एकशेषद्वंद्व माता च पिता च पितरौ; by 'पिता मात्रा'। Pán. I. 2. 70; also (मातापिरौ) तयोः। पर &c.—coveting a morsel of food from others. काकैरिव—*Cf*. *supra*. śl. 46 and भुक्तं मानविवर्जितं परगृहेष्वांशङ्कया काकवत् । sl. 4.

 ŚI.49, परिगताः—died,

of. परिगतः *V. I.* Veni. III. अपगताःis simpler. To explain गमिताः Rämarshi adds कालेनेति शेषः. This will do very well. But Mr. Telang thinks गमिस to be an instance of स्वार्थे णिच् and refers for a parallel instance to Rag. II. 50. In the passage referred to, however, the causal sense is not at all justifiable, which is not the case in the present passage. सिकतिल&c.—see Pân. V. 2. 105. quoted in the com.; चादण्मतुप् च। सिकताः सन्त्यस्मिन्देशे इति सिकतिलः, सैकतः,सिकतावान् Sid.Kau. Fig. *Upamá.*

 SI. 50 तस्यार्धस्य परस्य चार्धम्—Explain तस्यार्धस्य पञ्चाशत्संख्याकस्य अर्धस्य अर्धं साधंद्वादश वर्षाणि (बाल्ये) पुनः तस्य परस्यार्धस्यार्धं सार्धद्वादश वर्षाणि (वृद्धत्वे) इत्यर्थः। शेषं उर्वरितमायुः पञ्चविंशतिवर्षपरिमितमित्यर्थः।Human life extends over 100 years. Half of this is passed in the night, one fourth of the latter *viz.*  
 V. N. 5



 12½ years is passed in childhood and old age each. (In computing this the night-time is not taken into consideration, and the day is supposed to be of 24 hours as usual; this makes the 12½ years equivalent to 25 years for boyhood and for old age.) Mr. Telang suggests that तस्य परस्यार्थस्यार्धम्should be taken to mean रात्रिगतेतरार्ध (*i.e.* दिनगतारर्ध) स्यार्धम्i.e. half of the 50 years passes by day time. This gives 25 years for youth and old age together. अपरं—may be taken as in the com. or as an*adv*.; besides, another thing is that &c.

 ŚI. 51. The comparison of man with an actor pervades the whole verse. कामरसिकः—delighting in enjoyments. संसारान्ते—at the close of his wordly existence. यमधानीº—यमस्य धानी, सैव जवनिकाa curtain; as an actor having acted his part in several ways, retires behind the curtain on the stage, so man retires to the seat of death from the platform of the world.

 ŚI. 52. प्रज्ञा refined or acute intellect. अभिमान—just pride.मानव—may mean (1) मानं ददाति ( स्वेभ्यः) इति; one who confers honour (on his dependants); and (2) मानं द्यति इति fromमान+दो (अवखण्डने) one who subdues the pride (of the enemy or insults others); the second sense, however, seems to be intended here. एकान्ततः—totally, utterly.

 ŚI. 53. The same idea is rendered clearer in this. वयं—The use of the pl.shows that the speaker wishes to assert his own greatness. यावदर्थम्—यावादर्थः तावत।we are the sole masters of the wealth of words *i.e.* werule supreme over the domain of letters. गिरां—The Gen. by the rule अधीगर्थदयेशांकर्मणि (षष्ठी) ।Pån. II. 3. 52. Words meaning to remember or remembrance and the roots दय्and for ईग् govern the Gen. of their object.  

 ŚI.54. दुकूलैः—is a better reading than चं लक्ष्या as it gives a good contrast with वत्कलैः.निर्विशेषो विशेषः—Ramarshi explains as follows:—अत्र विशेषः अन्तरं भेद इत्यर्थः। निर्विशेषः अनाधिक्यः। अत्र विशेषे अन्तरं नास्तीत्यर्थः।The philosopher says to the king—what you regard as *greater* satisfaction is not so in my estimation. Mr. Telang does not think Râmarshi's explanation to be satis–



 factory, and proposes that विरोष should be taken to mean 'great ness,' (उत्कर्ष). This is certainly no improvement on Râmarshi's interpretation which is quite unobjectionable and gives good sense. The fig. is *Arthantaranyása.*  
 ŚI. 55. फलं—विषं *v. I*. is not appropriate. शयन—a bed or couch; *fr*.शी+ल्युट् (अन्) added अधिकरणे*Cf*. शय्या च भुः*sI.*16*supra*.; also 27, 95. नवधन &c.—upstart wealth often produces intoxication. अनुमन्तुम्—to consent to, to tolerate. *Cf.* for the idea, *infra*. śl. 27.

 ŚI. 56. This śl.gives expression to the thoughts of some one disgusted with royal service.अशीमहिः—for अश्रीमहि.आशा (the quarters ) एव वास; *cf.* दिगम्बर.  
 ŚI. 57. विटाः—flatterers, panderers. In dramas this word has a technical meaning. It means the companion of the hero or a king who is skilled in one art only. See om. गायनः—ल्युट् (अन) added कर्तरि. नृपस०—A king's palace is frequented by buffoons, flatteres, and licentious and malicious people. The poet says, as he is none of these, a royal court is not the place for him. Mr.Telang here quotes from Juvenal the following parallel lines:—

"What's Rome to me, what business have I there?  
I who can neither lie, nor falsely swear,  
Nor praise my patron's under serving rhymes."

 SI. 58. विपुलहृदय—large-hearted, generous-minded-refers to Brahma and other Prajápatis, or to Brahmá alone, the pl. being used आदरे. विधृतम्—uphold, preserved-refers to Vishnu and others or to Vishnu alone. दत्तं &c.—probably a reference to Parasuráma, who conquered the world, and presented it to the Brahmañas. कतिपय &c.—when supremacy has been acquired over a few towns. मदज्वर—*Cf.*ज्वर इव मदो मेNit. Sat. 1. 8.

 SI.59. अभुक्तायां &c.—The sovereign is considered as the husband of the earth by Sanskrit poets. *Cf*ना विष्णुः पृथिवीपतिः where the king is spoken of as the husband of the earth. क इव बहुमानः—what honour is it, indeed? हव being used for emphas is



 like वा in मृतः को Nit. Sat. 32. *Cf*. परैस्स्वदन्यःक इवापहारयेत् &c.. Kir. I.31. or क इव—what sort of. (what reason have they for).लेशेपि पतयः—the Loc. is noteworthy; see Pån. II. 3.30.विषादेकर्तव्ये–Mr.Telang here remarks–'for having so litte' they should have grieved; but it would be better to suppose that they should have chiefly grieved for being the lords of भुक्तोच्छिष्टा पृथ्वी.

 ŚI. 60. मृत्पिण्डः&c.–The whole earth is a ball of clay encircled by the line of water (sea); it is indeed, very small, and is parcelled out among themselves by a number of kings after hundreds of fights. These petty chiefs are poor and meanminded. The poet, therefore, despises those that wish to get something out of them. स्वांशीकृष्य is preferable to भागीकृत्य— which simply means 'having divided.'

 Śl. 61.कोऽपि—indescribable, unnamable. स जातः आसीत्—he alone was born; he alone deserves to be counted as having been born, the birth of others is as good as nothing. उच्चैः—on high; or so as to give it high honour. अलङ्कारविधये—for the purpose of decoration, as a decoration, or ornament. It is well known that Siva decorates himself with a string of the skulls of those who fall on the battle-field &c.; comp. कपालि वा स्यादथवेन्दुशेखरम्। Kum. V. 7s. That deity does not, however, give preference to one skull in particular, nor does he wear it on his head, as the peet seems to imply.प्रवण derived from प्रु 1. A. to 80 +ल्युट् (अन) प्रवन्ते अनेन अत्र वा sloping 'प्रवणः क्रमनिम्नोर्व्योपह्ये ना तु चतुष्पथे ।Amara;'inclined, disposed; नृभिः नमद्धिः—Instr. Absolute, same as the Loc. Absolute, नृषु नमत्सु सत्सु or the Inter. may be हेतौ (the whole being equivalent to नृणां नमनैः as Mr. Telang has it.). दर्पज्वरभरः—excess of feverish or morbid pride.

 SI. 62. प्रसादं नेतुम्to propitiate.क्लेशकलिलम्–The confusedmass of misery. *cf* महकलिलम् Bg. XI. 52, कल्पे कल्यते वाः कल+इल (च); Un.I.54.'कलिलं गहनंसमे।Amara.' Mr. Telangreadsकलितम्.He says 'कलितं might mean बन्धन but this requires a straining'. स्वयमुदित &c.—चिन्तामणि is a jewel the possession. of which is believed to give any desired object..



 When the mind is content it has acquired the power of the चिन्तामणि; for having nothing to wish for it can be said that it has given itself all that it longs for.विमुक्तः सङ्कल्पः&c.—When all desires have been foregone, every desire has in fact been gratified. *Cf*. Gita II. 70, 79.यदा सर्वे प्रमुच्यन्ते कामा येस्य हृदि स्थिताः। अथ मर्त्योऽमृतो भवत्यत्र ब्रह्म समश्रुति॥ Kathop. 2. 3, 14.

 SI. 63. स्वयम् &c.–The line gives expression to fatalism.*Cf.*यदभावि न तद्भावि भावि चेन्न तदन्यथा। इति चिन्ताविषघ्नोयमगदः किं न पीयते॥ Hit.I.The line may also be interpreted as–things happen in the best way when they are allowed their natural way.They are not brought about so well by exertions. असङ्कल्पयन्—not forming anticipations or expectations. अनुभवस्य—भू "to be"with अनु is Pars.; so this must be taken as a form of भू to get or obtain which is P. A.; or separate अनुभव स्वभोगान्.

 ŚI. 64. आयासक—troublesome goes with गहनात्. विरम् governs the Abl. of the object from which cessation is meant. श्रेयोमार्गम्(the obj.of आश्रयin1.1.)—the path of final beatitude.अतिशयेन प्रशस्यं श्रेयःwhat is most to be praised–hence sought*, i.e*मोक्षः मुक्तिः कैवल्यनिर्वाणं श्रेयोनिःश्रेयसामृतम्। मोक्षोपवर्गः—Amara. क्षणात् goes with शमनं. शान्तं भावं, which is necessary for entering on the श्रेयो मार्ग.गतिcourse, movements. *Cf*.विधिगतीः sl. 87 *Infra.*भूयः—again, with persistence.

 ŚI. 65. Addressed to the mind. मार्गयImper. 2nd sing. Some read मोहं मार्जयताम्—of those who have swept away infatuation.'ताम्in our reading means प्रसिद्धाम्. तटभुवाम् of the grounds on the bank. आसङ्गमङ्गीकुरु–resort to the vicinity of. को वा प्रत्ययः—what faith can be placed? The answer being 'none'.स्त्रीषु श्रीषु *v. I.*may equally do. *Cf.* आपण्डितास्ते पुरुषा मता मेये स्त्रीषु च श्रीषु चविश्वसन्ति। पन्नग-पन्नं पतितं यथा तथा गच्छतीति.

 ŚI. 66. अस्था—earnestness. भूपाल०—Fortune very often depends upon the royal favour a man enjoys and its stability or otherwise is to be determined from a look of pleasure or a frown that the king's face wears. Lakshmî is, therefore, compared to a dancing girl dancing in imitation of the movements



 of a prince's eye-brows. कन्याकञ्चुकिताः—कञ्चुकः एषां

सञ्जीात.किताः। कञ्चुक is a word of the तारकादि group and therefore takes the possessive aff. इत. *Cf*. स्यूतकन्थाधरः.sI.96.*Infra.*

 SI. 67. दाक्षिणात्याः–Fr. दक्षिण+त्यक्meaning 'of that place';ports of the Deccan who were masters of the *Vaidarbhi* style of composition which is regarded as the best. The Vaid. style has ten qualities; see Kavya.I. Sah. Dar describes it as माधुर्यव्यञ्जकैर्वर्णैरचिता ललितात्मिका। अवृत्तिरल्पवृत्तिर्वा (having no or very few compounds) वैदर्भीरीतिरिष्यते॥ यद्यस्त्येवम्—but this is not possible except in very few instances, and so the didactic character of the verse cannot be marred by its apparent acquiescence in the enjoyment of pleasures.

 ŚI. 68. कल्पं स्थितं—Nouns showing duration of time are put in the Acc. Pan. II. 3. 5. For कल्प seenotes, Nit. Sat. 16.

 ŚI.69. मरणजन्मभयंहृदिस्थम्—If this fear is present in the mind of man, he will try to obtain final beatitude; but if he is not aware of it, he will not work out his salvation. हृदिस्थम्an *Aluk* Compound. *Cf.* this with the preceding Śl.

 ŚI. 70. अजर—not subject to old age as it is निर्विकारः comp.'सत्यं ज्ञानमनन्तं ब्रह्म' Tait Up.; पुराणमजरं विदुः Rag. X.19. परमम्—The highest. परा उत्कृष्टा मा शद्वेन मायाख्या शक्तिर्यस्य। अथवा परा उत्कृटा मा शोभा यस्य तत्तथा। Rámarshi. विकासि—*Cf*. The Śrutis परास्य शक्तिर्विविधैव भूयते स्वाभाविकी ज्ञानबलक्रिया च andतमेव भान्तमनुभाति सर्व तस्यैव भासा सर्वमिदं विभाति। विकल्प—विषयःRâmarshi; or rather fancies, dreams, as Mr. Telang takes it..अनुषङ्गिणः—those that follow, depend upon. कृपण०—highly valued by mean people. कृपण may also mean poor, to be pitied (for losing sight of the real); see com.;*supra –*०गहनाक्षेपकपणः Mis.sI. 2.

 SI. 71. मानस Vocsing.; some take मानसचापलेन as a Comp.meaning 'with the swiftness of thought (lit. mind),' and suppose the verse to be addressed to man in general. Rámarshi favours the former view. जातु—with the negative means'Never.' आत्मनीनम्—आत्मने हितम् tending to one's benefit.आत्मविश्वजनभोगोत्तरपदात् खः ।Pan.V. 1. 9. आत्मन्, विश्वजन, and



 compounds having भोग for their latter member take ख (ईन)in the sense of 'तस्मै हितम्' as पितृभोगीन &c.

 ŚI. 72. स्वर्गग्रमकुटी—The comparison of heaven to a village hut shows the contempt with which a Vedantin, longing for*Moksha*, treats the pleasures of heaven. विभ्रम—Sport. भवबन्ध—दुःखरचना–Rámarshi explains by रचना by प्राप्ति. Mr. Telang takes it to mean 'expanse', 'large extent,' but without any apparent authority. The meaning which naturally suggests itself from the primary meaning 'arrangement' of the word, is 'predestination, pre-arranging for future births.'स्वात्मनन्द &c.—फलनंthe compassing or effecting of &c. Râmarshi explains—स्वात्मानन्द एव परमानन्द एवं पदंवस्तु तत्र प्रवेशकलनमनुभवधारणम्। वणिग्वृत्तयः—mercenary doings.

 Sl. 73.यदा—since, when. धरणधरपादैः—by the feet (the hills of the foot) of mountains; the mountains are said to uphold the earth and have a number of synonymous words to denote them from this circumstance, such as महीध्र, भूभृत्, &c. Râmarshi gives as optional meaning 'शेष'. The word पाद presents some difficulty in the way of accepting either sense, as the serpent Śesha has no feet, as also mountains. The adjacent hills or mountains are, however, regarded as their feet and the mountains are described as supporting the earth with their feet. So we may accept the meaning 'mountains' and reject 'Sesha'.The fig.is *Kávyárthapattihi.*

 ŚI. 74. सङ्कुचितं—Shrunken, shrivalled. आद्रियते—fr.हृ A. 6 cI;न शुश्रूषते does not serve, or attend to. अभिश्रायते—अमित्र इवाचरति; denom. verb. Cf, Pt. IV. 74.

 ŚI. 75. जरापरिभव—the injury or ravages done by old age.*Cf*.व्याघ्रीव &c. *supra* śl. 39. The reading तदा पुमांसम् is easier. We need not in this case supply पुंस. fr. पुंसां as object to परिहृत्य आरोपित—Mr. Telang says that this refers to the bit of bone suspended overa Chândâlakâpa (to distinguish it from wells used by the higher classes).

 SI. 76. स्वस्य—at ease, lit. in its natural condition *i. e.* not enfeebled by diseases &c.अरुजं—free from disease; as this



 idea, however, is included in स्वस्थthe reading कलेवरगृहंmay be preferred. The human body is frequently referred to as a‘house'; for therein dwells the soul. यादच्च&c.—and as long as the senses retain their faculties unimpaired. The last line very pithily expresses an idea which brings home to the most careless reader the necessity for striving to save his soul.

 Śl. 77. "Human life being only as long as a few twinklings of the eye, how are we, the poet asks, to secure the four पुरुषार्थ^(s) viz .धर्म, अर्थ, काम and मोक्ष ?" This seems to be what Rámarshi thinks of the verse. The reference to अर्थin the text is of the faintest character. सुरनदीम्—वस्with अधिgoverns the Acc.; नि however, is not mentioned among the prepositions given in the Sutra. Mark the alliteration in this sl.  

 ŚI. 78. अमीº—so well known. नुरगचलचित्ताः–neither very common nor a good simile; a horse is known for fleetness and not for fickleness. It simply means here 'restless like a spirited horse'. *Cf.* Bâna's description of Lakshmi—इयं हि.....इन्दुशकलादे कान्तवक्रतामुचैः श्रवसश्वञ्चलतां....गृहीत्वा &c. बद्धमनसः—longing for (eminence). In line 4 the word अन्यत्रseems to be redundant, as we have already अन्यत्.

 SI. 79.

वसुनि खण्डिते—Rámarshi explains this as 'wealth being partitioned out'; in connection with the last two lines, however, this primary meaning will not suit; and we must have the secondary sense 'wealth being destroyed' here. व्यर्थश्च—(वि+अर्थम्)without getting any money (in charity, for which he comes).

जह्युकन्या—The Ganges is so called from the King Jahnu. "The river Ganges, when brought down from heaven by the austerities of Bhagiratha (See N'it.Sat. śl. 10.). was forced to flow over earth to follow him to the lower regions. In its course it inundated the sacrificial ground of King Jahnu who being angry drank up its waters. But the gods and sages, and particularly Bhagiratha, appeased his anger, and he consented to discharge those waters from his ears. The river is therefore regarded as his daughter." Apte's Sk. Dictionary.



 Another account of the descent of the Ganges, however, states that Jahnu was a Rahi performing penance and that the Ganges in its course having disturbed the sage in his concentration by flooding the country where he was, the sage in anger stopped the course of the river by pressing it under his thigh. At Bhagiratha's earnest entreaties, however, he let the stream flow again. कन्दर and दरि are usually given as synonymousterms;'दरि तु कन्दरो वा स्त्री'Amara; while कुञ्ज has a different shade of meaning.'निकुञ्जकुञ्जौवा क्लीबे लतादिपिहितोदरे' Amara. A कुञ्जis a hollow in a mountain covered over with creepers and other plants. दरि is a cave, a hollow *dug out or opened up* in the side of a hill; and, कन्दर,though synonymous with दरि should rather be taken here to mean the gorge or defile between two hills, in which sense it is used in śl. 26. क्वचित्—For दरिread तटि in the text.

 SI. 80.रम्यं साधु &c.—company of religious people cannot but be pleasing. तरलम्—glistening, beaming; *cf*. न प्रभातरलंज्योतिरुदेति वसुधातलात् Sak. Rāmarshi gives चपलम् as its explanation. उपाहित—placed (there, by anger). अनित्यतामुपगते &c.—When the mind has become unsteady *i. e.* is not its usual mood, nothing pleases it. Or when thoughts of the mutability of this existence cross the mind, it becomes distracted and then it cannot relish anything earthly, except the joy of Brahman.

 ŚI. 81. प्रीयते—the Dat, case as indicating the result दीपाङ्कुर—the tapering flame.छाया—shadow. Rámarshi explains it byआतपप्रत्यनीका—(the country of light) which Mr. Telang does not accept. He gives it the meaning of 'flame'; but as the word दीपाङ्कुर already occurs the word छायाwould be redundant if it were taken to signify 'flame.' The shadow thrown by the flickering flame of a lamp is even more unsteady than the flame on account of its magnitude. आकलय्य—having fully comprehended or known.

 ŚI. 82.आसंसारं—त्रिभुवनम् &c.—(Searching through) thethree worlds where the course of worldly life prevails:–Telang. The mind is deeply attached to sensual objects as the elephant



 is to his mate. In order to secure the elephant, there must be a strong post (आलान); and to curb a sensual mind a strong control or restraint. The post and the restraint, the elephant and the mind and the sensual objects and the female elephant, are the pairs compared here. तादृक—a worldly man who is strong-minded enough to resist the temptation of sensual objects.क्षीव—intoxicated. आलान a post for fastening elephants..

 ŚI. 83. कार्पण्य—o*f*. कृपणां वृत्तिंNit. Sat. śl. 49. उपशम्–tranquillity, or peace of mind, subduing the passions entirely. बहिः मन्दस्पन्दम्—(the mind too), moving (but) slowly towards external objects. The mind is solely engaged in contemplation and hardly bestows any thought on external objects. The internal objects for a comtemplative mind are itself and the Supreme Soul; while the entire creation constitutes outer things. These latter are referred to by the word बहिस.

 ŚI. 84. जीर्णाः—have died out. *Cf.*जीर्णमङ्गे सुभाषितम्sl.2. वन्धफलतां याताः—have become sterile,have bore no fruit. कृतान्तः—see com.; or कृतं अन्तयतीति.अक्षमी—unforgiving, unrelenting;क्षमा विद्यते अस्य क्षमी न क्षमी अक्षमी. ह्याज्ञातम्—*v.I*.=हि+आ+ज्ञातम्,आbeing taken स्मरणेasMr. Telang suggests. But here हिhas no propriety.

 ŚI. 85. मे भेदप्रतिपत्तिर्नास्ति—I see no difference; I havenoidea of difference berween&c. प्रतिपत्ति—knowledge,idea.जगताम्—the plural is used because according to the Hindu notion there are 14 worlds.

 SI.86. पुलिने–'तोयोत्थितं तत्पुलिनं' Amara; a sandy bank left by receding water; goes with द्युसरितः द्युसरित्—the heavenly river, the Ganges. भावाभोगाद्विग्नाः—बहुदुःखजन्मपरम्पराभीताः Rāmarshi; *cf*.शमसुखाभोग sl. 96 *infra*. आत्तवचसः *v.I.*.—आत्तं गृहीतं वचः यैः तेwho have taken to (i. e. are repeating) the words. आनन्दोद्गत&c.—Bah. The joy referred to is, of course, resulting from the manifestation of the Supreme Deity in contemplation. आर्तवचसः *v. I.* is meaningless unless we take it to mean'earnest cries, fervent prayers,' (आर्तस्य इव वचः येषां).



 SI. 87. वितीर्ण—given away; p. p. of तृ, with वि.तरुण–young tender. विगुण &o.—having an unfortunate result. विधिगतीः—the motions the working of fate त्रियामा—the night. 'त्रियामा क्षणदा क्षपा' Amara. याम is *prahara* or 3 hours 'द्वौयामप्रहरौसमौ'Amara; and the night is considered to have only three *praharas,* the first half watch and the last half watch being excluded. शरण—a protector, saviour.

 ŚI. 88. वाराणसी—Benares. त्रिपुरहर—this alludes to the story of the three *Puras* or towns of the demons, of gold, silver, and iron, situated in the sky, air and on earth, and built for them by Maya, which were burnt down by Siva along with the demons inhabiting them. See Kum. VII. 48 आक्रोशन्—merely means here–loudly uttering.

 SI. 89. ध्येय—(i. e. You) who deserve to be contemplated. क्षितिधर &o.—There does not seem to be any propriety of मूले। आत्मारामः—finding delight in self (i. e in the contemplation of the Belf or Brahma). समकरचरणे—On this Rámarshi obaerves सम करचरणो (मकरेण सहितौ समकरौचरणौयस्य) हि पुमान् धनवान्भवतीति सामुद्रिके प्रसिद्धम्। मत्स्याङ्कितचरणोहि पुमान् धनवान् भवतीत्यपि। ध्यानमार्गैक &o. v. ८.—ध्यानस्य मार्गः, तद्विषयक एकः केवलः प्रश्नोयस्य सः। his only inquiry being that touching the method of contemplation. This reading, however, violates the metre.

 ŚI. 90. एकाकी—एकः एव अकति गच्छतीति going alone in the world. पाणिपात्रः—to whom his hand is serviceable like a pot. कर्मनिर्मूलन—destroying entirely the roots. This is essential to cut off the repetition of births and deaths. This is done by being सङ्गरहित as indicated in the first half. Samsára is here compared to a tree of which actions are the roots. *Cf*. अश्वस्थमेनं सुविरुढमूलमसङ्गशस्त्रेण दृढेन छित्वाBg XV. 3; also Sáriraka Bhäshya on Brah. SūIV. I. 14, 19.

 SI. 91. पात्रय—adenom. भैक्षम्—भिक्ष्यत इति what is obtained by alms; fr. भिक्ष्+अ बहुतृणम् & little short of almost equal to, grass; see com. तृणकल्पमित्यर्थः। 'विभाषा सुपौ बहुच् पुरस्तानु' Pän. V. 3. 63 ईषदसमात्तिविशिष्टेऽर्थे सुबन्तात् बहुच्(the prefix बहु) वा स्यात्स च प्रागेव (prefix) न तु परतः। इषदूनः पदुः बहुपटुः &c. Sid. Kau.



 अत्यागेपि&c.—Even though the body is not cast off *i.e.*he will not have to wait for a second birth. सम्पत्स्यते—see Kum.II. 54 &c. स्पृहां सम्पत्स्यते *v.I.*—In this case सम्पत्mustbe understood as used transitively.

 SI. 92. कौपिनं—a small piece of cloth used to cover the privities. जर्जरतर–extremely ragged.चिन्ता–act of contemplation. Also a thought about (*i. e*. a wish for) a secluded place. ध्वस्ताशेष&c.—delighted at the total destruction of egotism and errors; or मदात्प्रमादाः errors arising from egotism or pride.

 ŚI. 93. ब्रह्माण्डं मण्डलीमात्रं—*v.I.* a mere circular body *i. e.*which is limited in space and not अपरिछिन्न् like Brahman.This is perhaps a better reading. शफरी—a small fish. क्षुब्धता 'जातु जायते—a question implying the negative answer in itself—Is ever agitation produced &c.?'— 'Never.'जातुever, at any time.

 SI. 94. मा स्म भूः–माsometimes followed by स्म, is used with a form of the Imperf. or Aorist with the aug. अ + dropped. *Cf.*क्रैव्यं मास्म गमः पार्थ &c.Bg. II. 3. भोगेभ्यः—'the Dat. byस्पृहेरीप्सित; Pán. I. 4. 36. In the case of the root स्पृहthe object desired is put in the Dative case. स्पृहयालु—fromस्पृह+आलुby 'स्पृहगृहि पतिदयिमिद्रातन्द्राश्रद्धाभ्यआलुच्—'Pán. III. 2.358;

soगृहयालु, पतयालु &c. स्यूत—stitohed; p. p. p. of सिद् 4 cl.भिक्षासक्तु—barley–flour (obtained by) begging. *Cf. infra*. Mis. śl. 37.

 SI. 95. उपधानम्—pillow; fr. उप+धा+ ल्युट् (अन). वितान—m .n. a canopy. वितन्यते इति fr. तन् with वि+घञ् (अ). विरतिवनिता—*Cf.* *infra.* Mis. 39, कुरुत करणामैत्रीप्रज्ञावधुजनसङ्गमम् where करुणा,मैत्री and प्रज्ञाare likewise called wives. सुखम्—an adv. here.अतनु &c.—from the adj. तनु the fem. forms or तनु or तन्वी.सूतिhas two meanings viz. (1) 'prosperity' as applicable to the king and (2) 'ashes' as applicable to the Muni. *Cf*. Mis. śl. 34, *infra.*

 SI. 96. स्वयात्त&c.—जितेन्द्रियः whose movements are under control; who practises self-restraint.आस्यूत&c.—an एकदेशी अन्वय संप्रोत*v. I.* sewn together, patched with. शममुखाभोग&c.—



 आभोगenjoyment in full (आ); or with Rámarahi, परिपूर्णता. *Cf.*०ग्रासैकबद्धत्पृहNit. Sat. 29.  
 SI. 97. तत्त्व &c.—whose intellect is keen in discerning (thinking out) the truth, discrimination of the real from the unreal. तत्पन्न &c.—wise men do not care what others speak about them, but silently go their own way. स्वयं—स्वेनैव रुपेण आनन्दवन्तः। 'by themselves' Râmarshi; or 'without meddling with others' will also do.

 SI. 98. मरुत् अशनं कल्पितं—In such constructions the noun used to complete the sense of verbs of incomplete predication is put in the Nom. case; See Apte's G. § 12. (a). हिंसाशुन्यम्—free from the sin of causing the destruction of animal life *Cf.*Goldsmith—

"And from the mountain's grassy side  
A guiltless feast I bring.''

  पशवः—beasts are created so as to live on grass. स्थलीशायिनः—lying on the lawn; स्थली means a natural plot of land. संसार&c.—To those that do not possess the faculty of reason, God has assigned a cheap, easy livelihood; but to those who can think out the means of their salvation (*i. e.* men). He has assigned a mode of life in pursuit of which all their good qualities are exhausted. The struggle for existence, in the case of man, engrosses all his energies, and leaves him neither time, nor energy to seek eternal bliss. It is difficult to see the bearing of this śl. here. Probably the poet means—Men should, therefore, feel disgust for worldly life and direct their efforts to the acquisition of *Moksha*.

 SI. 99. पद्मासनंis a particular posture in religious meditation, thus described:—उत्तानौचरणौ कृत्वा ऊरुसंस्थौप्रयत्नतः। ऊरुमध्ये तथोत्तानौ पाणी पद्मासनं त्विंदम्॥ Or ऊरुमूले&c. see com.; योगनिन्द्रा—A sleep of meditation or contemplation. योगो मनसोविषयान्तरव्यावृत्तिः तद्रूपा निद्रा। contemplation of the mind on Brahma is here likened to sleep because the Yogi is dead to the external world during the time of meditation–his mind takes cognisance of no external objects like that of a man fast asleep.कि तैर्भाव्यम्—will they ever be ? कण्डयन्ते—A denom. from कण्डू



 (कण्डुञ् अङ्गविधर्षणे). The reading सम्पत्स्यन्ते&c. adopet by Mr. Telang (see foot-note) is more poetical but requires some such expression as 'from me' to be supplied.

 ŚI. 100. भैक्षम्—food collected together by begging.'भैक्षं भिक्षाकदम्बकम्'Amara. निःसङ्गता&c.—see com.; the development of the mind consisting in renouncing all worldly attachments; or निःसङ्गता अङ्गीकरणस्य परिणतिः; here परिणति means—theend, close, or termination; hence the closing act of life. When a man has accepted asceticism (निसङ्गता) he has no worldly actions to perform. His accepting asceticism is therefore the last act of his life.—दान्तःकरणपरिणतिः *v.I.*is to be similarly explained;—परिणतस्वान्तis another reading which means—करणेनपरिणतं यत्स्वान्तं तेनसंन्यस्त &c.—Those who have abandoned*(i. e*. got rid of) the multitudes of contacts (*i.e.* opportunities) of self-humiliation (in supplicating others.). Telang. व्यतिकर—contact, connection; or misfortunes, calamities.

 Śl. 101. मातः,तात&c.—The Vocatives.are significant. See com. The five elements perform the same functions as the various relatives mentioned and serve to nourish the body &c.अन्त्यः—last, as I have to take no further birth, (for he says further on 'परे ब्रह्मणि लीये') this salutation must be the last from me. युष्मत्सङ्गº—for, without the body, formed of the elements, he could not have attained the knowledge of Brahma.उद्रेक—overflow, abundance. लीये—be absorbed in.This sl, forms the fitting conclusion of the Sataka.

The poet bewails the wretchedness of the sun and the moon who are here described as having but one strip of cloth in common to cover themselves with. The fig. here is Ślesha. It is thus defined:– श्लेषः स वाक्य एकस्मिन्यत्रानेकार्थता ।K. P. X. When in the same sentence more than one meaning is possible it is श्लेष.



 SI. 2. विवेकन्याकोशे—विवेक is the same as नित्यानित्यवस्तुविवेकdiscrimination of the real from the unreal.

For this purpose and others (शमदमोपरतितितिक्षासमाधानश्रद्धाख्याः। Ved.Sa.)are necessary. व्यकोश means 'unfolding, budding;' hence development. When one has *discrimination,* one should try to acquire *S'ama*and others. शम is defined as शमस्तावत् श्रवणादि- व्यतिरिक्तविषयेभ्यो मनसो निग्रहः *i.e.* restraining the mind from all other objects and devoting it to the hearing of the recital of holy texts &c.*(i. e.*मनन, निदिध्यासन &c.)—व्याकोश may also be taken as an*adj*.; see com. विकसित when it blooms and so produces the wished for result, viz. the annihilation of all desires—तुङ्ग—lofty; hence strong attachment. सा परिणतिः—that well known perfection (of contemplation) viz. what is called जीवन्मुक्तिin which one enjoys the joy of Brahma.

 (as also). कियद्वा&c.—To be brief, in short. वटविटपः&—it is difficult to see the propriety of calling the *Vața* tree 'a *dayita'*; probably the poet refers by *dayitá* to गृहस्थाश्रम inwhich the wife plays a conspicuous part. Let the *Vata* tree be my home*i. e*. let me renounce the pleasures of the world and take to a devotee's life worshpping S'iva sitting under a *Vața* tree &c.

 SI. 6. त्रुटित&c.—the wordly ties which proved an obstruction to them having been snapped. आशीविष—a serpent; fr. आशी (a serpent's fang)+विष. The derivation more usually given is fr. आशीस+विष the Comp. being classed under the पृषोदरादि class.

 SI. 13. तीव्रातितीव्रं तपः—is the same to an ascetic as उद्यानेषु ०विधिto ordinary mortals. The two expressions are here identified and mean—to the ascetic penance is like a garden party. Some take the two expressions separately, but then there is hardly any propriety of garden parties in the case of a saint. अमितं भिक्षाटनं मण्डनम्—(where) a roaming for alms, not measured, *i. e.* at one's will, as a glory. हन्तis here used खेदे,to show the poet's regret at wise men staying elsewhere, and not in Benares.

 S1. 17. अनाावर्ती—which never returns.तास्ताः various. विधुर—see śl. 22. *supra*; distressing, causing afflictionयावत् यावत्—Mr. Telang's rendering will also do–'alas! what self-injury is there, having done which to yourself, you have not immediately worked at the same again.

But सुख and दुःख here seem to refer to the two courses of life marked out, viz. that of happily living on alms and worshipping Siva or that of living a miserable life of sycophany and humouring rich men. सदृश—should better be rendered by similar than by the same. The result, viz. obtaining food and clothing is similar in both cases but not the same as the one is full of happiness, the other attended by misery. त्रिनेत्र मदान्ध—mark the contrast suggested by these words.
