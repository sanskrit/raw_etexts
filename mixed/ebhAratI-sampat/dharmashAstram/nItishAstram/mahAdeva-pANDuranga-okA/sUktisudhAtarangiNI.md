**PREFATORY NOTE.**

![](../books_images/U-IMG-1697789247Screenshot2023-10-20133628.png)

 The cordial welcome with which my Sanskrit versions of about 300 quotations from various Western authors introduced in my **अभिनवरत्नमाला** Part II. have been received by the Sanskrit reading public has encouraged me to publish a separate volume containing Sanskrit versions of a number of other quotations of the same type. What success I have achieved in this labour of love, I leave my readers to judge. If I have the good fortune to see that this attempt of mine does interest those for whom it is intended, I mean to bring out more volumes (**तरङ्ग** s.) of the **सूक्तिसुधातरङ्गिणी** on a more comprehensive scale.



**INTRODUCTION**

![](../books_images/U-IMG-1697797613Screenshot2023-10-20155610.png)


  I agreed to write a few words of introduction to Mr. Oka's collection of English quotations rendered into Sanskrit, just because I thought that it would be a courteous way of acknowledging the debt I owe him for the many hours of delight I spent in his company when he read out to me the quotations and his excellent Sanskrit renderings of the original passages. The writer of introductions to books written by others acts the part of chorus in ancient drama. The public doesn't fancy such interpreters in these advanced days. They would rather deal directly with the author. Good wine, says the old English proverb, needs no bush, or, as a Sanskrit poet says, **न हि कस्तूरीकामोदःशपथेन विभाष्यते**.Moreover, I recalled the existence of many Sanskrit scholars who are far better qualified for this work than I. These considerations held me back for a time, but it is hard to refuse a request made by one of such transparent sincerity of purpose as Mr. Oka and I undertook the job in the hope that it would give me an opportunity to praise a friend who deserves all the good things one may say of him.  
  Mr. Oka has endeared himself to all lovers of Sanskrit by the two parts of **अभिनवरत्नमाला** which he published some time ago. By offering to the public this collection of quotations from European authors which he has rendered into Sanskrit (**सूक्तिसुधातरङ्गिणी**), he will have added one more title to their admiration and esteem. In these renderings of English quotations, Mr. Oka breaks new ground; I do not know that any one has essayed the task before. The author of the three parts of **लौकिकन्यायाञ्जलि**has put together a good many Sanskrit maxims and proverbs and wherever possible has given their English equivalents. But his work was essentially different and limited in scope. Mr. Oka's quotations cover a wider field. It is a collection of extracts made from writers well-known all over Europe and Mr. Oka has rendered them into his easy, fluent, graceful Sanskrit. As a rule,the translation follows the original lines of proseor verse and even if there



is a foreign flavour in the translated idea, the reader has no difficulty in understanding the drift of the quotation. Very frequently, however, it is hard to detect the original and its Sanskrit translation. The two are like new-born twins or to vary the image, they are like twin flowers springing from the same stem and branching on either side of it.

   There are 462 pieces in this collection. Most of them are quotations from famous writers. Occasionally, Mr. Oka translates proverbs, English, French, Gujarathi, Marathi and others. Sometimes he gives thoughts of his own which are expressed in a terse, pointed style. Towards the close, longer pieces are given and a few adaptations in Sanskrit verse of English lyrics, along with a few poems of his own which have their originals in his individual experience and feelings.

  Broadly speaking, the book is an anthology or posy of aphorisms, maxims, sayings, proverbs, instinct with the experience of the world and the wisdom that is the fruit of ex- perience. We have in these quotations the thoughts of the great and wise masters of life, to adopt the words of Lord Morley—on the eternal commonplaces of human occasion friendship, health, bereavement, riches, poverty, death. It is a literary chapter, says Morley, which concerns life, manners, society, conduct, human nature, our aims, our ideals and all besides that is most animated in man's busy chase after happiness and wisdom. Mr. Oka has, indeed, cast his net wide and his selection evinces a truly catholic point of veiw. For we have sentences and lines of verse in this book which reveal the shrewdnes and penetrating insight of one writer, the biting, bitter wit of another, the kindly genial humour of a third. Now we admire the brlliance of words and phrases, now the point, the concision, the delicacy of the art with which the thonght is turned, now it is the depth and infinity of suggestion enshrined in a tiny, wee sentence which evoke our wonder and admiration. The wisdom of the ages is 'hived inthese pages.' As we read the quotations which are garnered



here, we are enlightened, roused, uplifted, ennobled. They illuminate the understanding and point the way to right conduct. Mr. Oka's little volume offers what has been justly described as the literature of morality; it teaches and preaches.In a sense it is a criticism of life, but not in the sense in which the words are employed by Arnold in his famous definition that 'Poetry is at bottom a criticism of life.' Criticism is a word of unhappy associations, especially when it is used in regard to an essentially creative art, such as poetry and Arnold has paid heavily for this mistake. The criticism of life embodied in the many quotations in this book is in the majority of examples destitute of poetic qualities. For poetry presents truths of human life in the enkindling glow of imagination and passion and it clothes them in images and words of haunting charm and imperishable music. In the passages translated by Mr. Oka, we have only the cold brilliance of intellect. The phrases and words are clear-cut, chiselled; they arrest attention by their brilliance, polish and epigrammatic brevity. The cold light of reason and intellect rests on them. They do not possess the bewitching loveliness of colour and sound which one expects in poetry. But that can hardly be accounted as Mr. Oka's fault.  
  There are quotations in this collection from Tacitus,Epictetus, Shakespeare and Goethe. One meets with Bacon and Ben Jonson, Carlyle, Emerson, Confucius. We have Aristotle, Seneca, Pascal, Pope and La Bruyere. All these are far-shining names in European literature, and there are many others which I have not mentioned. Shakespeare figures prominently in these extracts and Goethe has also been freely laid under contribution. There is a large number of proverbs from various languages. Most of these quotations are short and concise. They express a mass of meaning in a few words. For the sense is brought to a point. There is an alertness in these lines and sentences, an intensity of thought, a delicacy of word and phrase, a polish and a sparkle which. account for the fascination they have for most readers.



  As a translator of these quotations, so pregnant with wit and wisdom, Mr. Oka has done his work admirably. Dryden laid down two qualifications for a translator. "The qualification of a translator worth reading", observes Dryden, "must be a mastery of the language he translates out of and that he translates into," but Dryden will condone a deficiency of mastery of the language of the original. No one who knows Mr. Oka will doubt his mastery of Sanskrit and the translations offered in this book will convince those who do not know him and bave not read his earlier books. Another principle which Dryden enunciates is that 'a translator who would write with any force or spirit of an original must never dwell on the words of an author." Mr. Oka bears this well in mind. He never clings fatuously to the words of the original, but plucks the soul out of them and invests the Sanskrit translation with an atmosphere of its own. The result is, his translations are just and accurate and mirror forth the meaning and spirit of thenogriial By not concentrating overmuch attention on the words of the original, Mr. Oka has avoided obscurity; and he never burlesques the original which is also the result of dwelling too much on the words of the author who is translated. In the many passages which he has rendered in Sanskrit, there are only a few in which 'the idiom of the original disturbs the reader' because the ghost is not successfully laid.

  This is all that a translator may hope to achieve. For the capital difficulty of translation—as Dr. Tagore pointed out once—is that it may be a reincarnation, but it cannot be identical. This is obvious because the sound of a word has a significance utterly apart from its meaning. Further, if the music and melody of words and the individual rhythms of a language are untranslatable, there are ahundred suggestions and associations bound up with words which cannot be shifted from one language to another as though they were dead stuff which might be hauled up from one trolley into another. "A version of a poem" adds Dr. Tagore, "may



be a finer piece of work, but it is not the same piece of work." Most of Mr Oka's translations are reincarnations and some of them are finer pieces of work than their originals. His only defect as a translator is that sometimes he adds to the original and alters it. On occasions this is due to exigencies of metre, but it is sound policy to keep one's hands off the passage quoted.  
 To give a few illustrations:The quotation from Vergil(No. 4)– “Don't celebrate your triumph before you have conquered—" expresses the common idea, "Don't haloo till you are out of the wood." Mr. Oka not only renders it aptly—**अजित्वा नैव कुर्वीत कदापि जयघोषणाम्** - but clothes it in an old— world atmosphere. For the word **जयघोषणाम्**recalls the well— known line in **'उत्तररामचरितम्' 'अयमश्वः पताकेयमथवा वीरघोषणा'** Such words and phrases as the घोषणाmentioned above are steeped in time-honoured associations and suggestions. They spring unbidden to Mr. Oka's lips and lend him potent help in naturalizing foreign thoughts in Sanskrit translation. example occurs in his translation of a German proverb (No 72) 'A penny by right is better than a thousand by wrong.' This is rendered by

**'एकःकाणवराटोऽपि धर्मेणाधिगतो वरम्।**  
**न त्वधर्मेण संप्राप्ताः सहस्रमपि रूपकाः॥'**

The word **काणवराट** at once takes us back to Bhartrihari's line, **'प्राप्तः काणवराटकोऽपि न मया तृष्णेऽधुना मुञ्चमाम्'** The employment of such a word produces in a trice the right atmosphere of Sanskrit poetry. It sets the reader at ease. Time and again, Mr. Oka's translation is well-nigh perfect. The quotation from Ward Beecher is a good example—No. 242— "Compassion will cure more sins than condemnation" **पापापमोदनेहेतुर्नानुकम्पेव गर्हणा.** Here not a syllable can be spared nor can a syllable be added. The translation fitaoriginal as a glove fits the hand. It is easy to multiply examples: Nos. 41, 44, 47, 83 must suffice for our present purpose. Sometimes he adds to the beauty



of the original by expanding the thought, or by introducing a new image. No. 155-Truth irritates only those...'—is an example of this last. The metaphor **बोधरविः**does not appear in the original and it endows the translation with an added attraction of its own. In No. 106-Mr. Oka states the contrary of the original which does not appear in the passage quoted. Such additions and alterations have their dangers, of course; for they result in padding and take away from the charm of the original by spoiling its pregnant brevity and wit.' There are a few instances, again, where his love of melody has betrayed him into making an addition to the original words. This has happened in No. 113. On the other hand, time after time, Mr. Oka achieves melody in these verse—translations without calling in the assistance of aditional words. Nos, 116, 187, 188, furnish good illustrations. Here and there, he fails to translate accurately and in a few of his Sanskrit renderings the foreign idiom remains a disturbing factor. No. 117 is, I believe, incorrecetly rendered. In No. 118 the rose flower appears as **'गुलाब'संज्ञंकुसुमं** and in No.9 **शृङ्गारनामा बटुः**sounds harsh to my ears. In No. 305 the same alien note is heard. Finally, Mr. Oka may be justly charged with the inclusion of some trivial quotations—such as Nos.129 and 313.

   The multiplicity and variety of quotations in this book will meet all kinds of tastes. A moralist will rejoice in No.194 which lays down a rule of conduct, A statesman will find No. 181 very much to his taste, for it touches on the prime duty of kings towards their subjects. A humourist will be delighted with No 142. A philosopher will smile as he reads No. 293 Most of us will find an echo of our experience in No.198. The quotations which make the strongest appeal to me are those which set me thinking, start a train ofsuggestions, literary or other—those which open up the chambers of the reader's mind and seem in Bradley's words"to beckon away beyond themselves and to expand into something boundless." It is in such passages. as these that I find my highest delight. No.15—"A dog is obeyed in



office" calls to my mind Napoleon's famous saying "Power is never ridiculous." And then I remember the proverb in the vernacular which speaks of the cur that dwells in a great man's house,—the Jack—in—office who guards the gate and insults with impunity the biggest people of the place when they have occasion to call on his master. And such cheeky behaviour puts me in mind of Isabel's words in Measure for Measure "Man, proud man, drest in a little brief authority like an angry ape plays such fantastic tricks as make the angels weep." I read No.166—"Pain past is pleasure" —and a line from Kalidasa leaps to my mind

**'प्राप्तानि दुःखान्यपि दण्डकेषुसंचिन्त्यमानानि सुखान्यभूवन्'**

This last suggests the contrasted scene in **उत्तररामचरितम्**where Rama is unable to look at the canvas portraying the scene of his separation from Seeta and bids Lakshmana refrain from unrolling it any further. This in turn suggests the idea— "How do the great and the rich feel when they are victims of calamity?—and one remembers Tennyson's translation of Dante's line "A sorrow's crown of sorrow is remembering happier days." I read No. 21—The good are better made by ill, I As odours crushed are sweeter still. It recalls the parallel thought in Bacon "Certainly virtue is like precious odours, most fragrant when they are incensed or crushed; for prosperity doth best discover vice but adversity doth best discover virtue" and how kindred is the thought in Jagannath!

**आपद्गतः खलु महाशयचक्रवर्ती, विस्तारयत्यकृतपूर्वमुदारभावम्।  
कालागुरुर्दहनमध्यगतः समन्ताल्लोकोत्तरं परिमलं प्रकटीकरोति॥**

I read the translation of the proverb—No.49–**'जन्मना नात्मनः पृष्ठं द्रष्टुं केनापि शक्यते'** and I remember the well known Nyaya

**'नहि सुशिक्षितोऽपि नटवटुः स्वस्कन्धमधिरोदुं पटुः'**

Finally, in the quotation from Cicero—"Liberty consists in the power of doing that which is permitted by law" we have a whole volume of noble thoughts packed into a short sentence. It is the gospel of liberty preached with such splendour of eloquence by Burke and Wordsworth.



 The brief aphoristic style of expression is nothing unfamilar to readers of Sanskrit literature, Almost every writer of distinction in Sanskrit can turn his hand to the work and make a successful job of it. Kalidasa has such tine close — knit expressions as **'आज्ञागुरूणां ह्यविचारणीया,' 'तेजसां हि न वयः समीक्ष्यते**' Kalidasa is, again, the author of that celebrated line '**अपथेपदमर्पयन्ति हि श्रुतवन्तोऽपि रजोटिमीलिताः'** Bhavabhuti has '**सर्वथा व्यवहर्तव्यं, कुतो ह्यवचनीयता,' 'सर्वंकषाभगवती** **भवितव्यतैव'** Bharavi has **'विचित्ररूपाः खलु चित्रवृत्तयः' 'दिशत्यपायं हि सतामतिक्रमः'** **'प्रकृत्यमित्रा हि सतामसाधवः'** but if I go on quoting like this I shall never finish. The harvest is ready to be gathered and I cannot imagine a person better fitted for the task than Mr. M. P. Oka He tells me hehas already started collecting such maximus and sayings Let me hope that before very long he will publish a goodly volume of such choice sayings culled from Sanskrit poets and prosaists Let him put the Sanskrit quotations side by side with quotations from European writers. So will the East dwell in happy harmony with the West in the domain of literature which recognises no delimiting frontiers.  
  I shall close this brief introduction by thanking Mr. Oka once again for the feast of reason which he has provided in this book; others, when they will have read the book, will, I have no doubt, entertain the same feeling of warm gratitute towards the author. Much that is good and enjoyable in this book I have, perhaps, left unnoticed; partly, owing to limitations of space, partly, doubtless, to my blindness. I have hinted at a few faults, but, they hardly make any show against the many striking merits of the book. It is indeed a fine achievement to have translated nearly 500 pieces (most of them in verse) and revealed such surprising excellencein translation.

KRUMMACHER—  
 See a fond mother encircled by her children; with pious tenderness she looks around, and her soul even melts with maternal love. One she kisses on its cheek, and clasps another to her bosom; one she sets upon her knee, and finds a seat upon her foot for another. And while by their actions, by their lisping words, and asking eyes, she understands their numberless little wishes, to these she dispenses a look, and a word to those; and, whether she grants or refuses, whether she smiles or frowns, it is all in tender love. Such to us, though infinitely high and aweful, is Providence; so it watches over us, comfcrting these, providing for those, listening to all, and assisting every one; and if sometimes it denies the favour we implore, it denies but to invite our more earnest prayers; or, if sceming to deny & blessing, it grants one in the refusal.
