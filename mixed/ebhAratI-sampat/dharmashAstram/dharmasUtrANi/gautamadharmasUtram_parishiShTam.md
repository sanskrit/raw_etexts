FOREWORD



THE ***Gautama-dharma-sūtra*** has already been published in various editions, and in one of them, which appeared in the Mysore Sanskrit series, there is a ***Paris**'**ista*** portion, in one ***Pras**'**na*** **The*Paris**'**ista*** contains one more chapter, and this portion is now, for the first time, made available to scholars. This is the second ***Pras'na*** of the ***Paris'ista***, the first has already appeared in the Mysore Sankrit Series. This portion contains twenty Chapters with an ***Anukramanikā***at the end. This ***Anukramanıkā*** gives the *Pratīkas* of the various Chapters in the reverse order, thus the first passage in the ***Anukramanikā*** is the*Pratīka*for the twentieth chapter, the next is for the nineteenth chapter, and so on. This portion now published is a***Paris**'**ista*** in the text, it is also a ***Paris**'**ista*** or supplement to the editions of the ***Gautama-dharma-sūtra*** and not a complete edition of a text.

One may wonder why these old texts are being published, what purpose it serves to man in his life. If the difference had been merely that what was available only in manuscript Is now made available in a printed edition and that in this way the text is also preserved from injuries to which a manuscript is exposed, perhaps it is not worth-while to undertake such an edition. The real justification lies in the value of the content of the text to man in his life Much is being heard about India's contribution to the world. But little is heard about the real nature of such a possible contribution The emphasis on the spiritual greatness of the wisdom of ancient India makes more a promise of escape from this world than a solution for the problems in this life.



So far as I am concerned, the true value of the wisdom of ancient India lies in its capacity to solve certain problems that face man at present. Rationalism started in European thought in the eighteenth century and developed into immence proportions in the nineteenth century Religion has been discredited, God is condemned, faith has been displaced from community life. But reason has not made man happier, reason has not offered any solution to problems whose origin is attributed to religion and faith Man is faced only with more serious problems, reason has only proved the old Upanisadıc statement-



**अविद्यायामन्तरे वर्तमानाः स्वयं धीराः पण्डितमन्यमानाः।**

**जङ्घन्यमाना परियन्ति मूढा अन्धेनैव नीयमाना यथान्धाः ॥**



It is worth while to inquire whether the social order in ancient India can offer any clue to modern problems.



It is not at all contended that one can refer to an ancient text for a solution of any modern problem in the same way in which one can refer to an income-tax reckoner to find out the amount of tax one has to pay Ancient civilization is only a sign-post that guides us, it is not a rest-house where one can spend one's time during a journey . If one clings to a sign-post on the road, one is missing the very purpose for which it is erected on the road-side.



In any progression, there must be a *moving away* from the previous positions, but that does not mean that there is a *breaking away* from the earlier positions. There is a break from the former positions when one falls down and not when one proceeds along. One can be said to be progressing or simply rambling, only in relation to the starting point and the position at any particular time relative to the starting point, and not in itself. When one returns to the position from which he has started or if one does not move much farther from that position though he is not exactly at that point, that is what is called a holiday stroll and not what is called a journey. This is another great value of a knowledge of the past.



When Darwin propounded his 'Theory of Evolution,' it is more a consolation than an explanation. By saying that the origin of the world is to be traced to a certain power within the matter in its "monistic," undivided state, rather than to a God, one does not get an answer to the many new problems that are roused up by such a postulate, and the old problems remain in their position And by stating, or at least suggesting, that "life" is only an accident in this world, which may disappear, the entire structure of moral law has been pulled down Life is reduced to a mere chemical action like the effect of putting a piece of metal in an acid, and there can be no question of "moral order" in a system of chemical actions in matter if cutting a man's head has no more importance in this world than breaking a salt-cube in a laboratory, where is social order, and where is morality? Even among animals, one does not initiate a moral question regarding the conduct of the crows towards the owls by day time and regarding the retaliation by the owls at night. But when one community of man invades the habitat of another community and molests that latter community, we start considering the problem ofinternational law Why? Darwinism cannot give any explanation for this question.



If the Church in Europe did not give satisfaction to the rationalists of those regions, the right path is not to denounce Church outrignt. what has to be done is to find out the mistake in the Church that has given rise to this dissatisfaction. One does not kill a man who is ailing, the proper method is to treat him to prescribed medicines. It is here that perhaps ancient Indian wisdom can give some help to modern man in his perplexities regarding the foundations of moral order in man's life.

The foundations of moral order in human society have been dealt with in the *Dharmasāstras* in India. When it is said that such foundations are to be seen in the Vedas, it does not mean that nere is a doctrine of undiluted authoritarianism “ It is said so in a text, so it must be accepted " .This is not what is called the " Vedic authority" for *Dharma* or "moral order". It is a rationally worked out doctrine, necessitated by the very nature of man's reason and satisfying reason to its fullest extent. Reason by its very nature establishes something that is not confined to reason. It is like a small mirror that can reflect the whole vast heavenly regions Man's life is traced to a source and is projected to an ultimate objective, both transcending reason, but comprehended by reason, as in the case of a small mirror that reflects the vast heavens "Natural selection," "survival of the fittest" and such other postulates attain a wider meaning within the framework of the “Vedic authority for moral order". Life is made a fundamental instead of discarding it as an accident, in the scheme of this universe There is a life unconditioned by material transformations side by side with life confined to material transformations, and life ultimately re-assumes the unconditioned state. The law governing this progression of conditioned life towards the unconditioned state is what is called the moral order. It is to be traced from the prior unconditioned state and is to be related to the ultimate unconditioned state. The law within the material transformation may be a scientific law, but what is called " Vedic law" is the law comprehending the unconditioned state of lite and the life in the conditioned state.



It is man's reason that investigates this law, and reason is satisfied by the validity of this law. It is not anti-rational, it may be super-rational. Reason can comprehend what is super-rational, though reason cannot delimit what is super-rational. This is the great value of the *Dharmasāstras.* The different applications of the law may not have much of a practical value except as a guide for understanding the nature of the application of a law. But they have as much value to one who wishes to formulate moral law in a society under modern conditions as a textbook on medicine has to a medical practitioner to understand a certain case that he has to treat. He will not find an answer to his difficulties in the text, but he can find a guide for such difficulties in it. Similarly, in the specific laws, which had a validity at one time, one finds a guide in the mode of formulating laws to suit modern conditions. This is the true value of such a publication. It has a definite purpose in man's life in modern life. It is far more than an antiquarian curiosity for an academic man.

**PREFACE**



IN the course of preparing the *Descriptive Catalogue* for the Dharmaśāstra section of the Sanskrit Manuscripts in the Adyar Library, I came across three manuscripts of the *Gautama-dharmastūtra-paris'ista*, consisting of two *praśnas* Of these, one manuscript contained only a portion of first *praśna.* It was found that the second *praśna* of the *pariśista*was unpublished and it was accordingly pointed out to the Library authorities that the work might be published by the Adyar Library. Dr. G Srinivasa Murti, the Director of the Adyar Library was kind enough to include it in the programme for the Adyar Library Series in which the work is now given the Serial No 64.



My thanks are due to the Director of the Adyar Library Dr. G. Srinivasa Murti for all the acts of kindness and encouragement which I have received in bringing out the work. Dr Kunhan Raja the Editor of the *Adyar Library Bulletin* not only furnished the space in the *Bulletin* for the publication of the work but has further placed me under a deep debt of gratitude by writing the 'Foreword' to the work Pandit V Krishnamacharya was kind enough to read through the press-copy of the work and suggest useful emendations.



I record with pleasure the help which I have received at every stage, in bringing out the work, from Pandit N. Ramachandra Bhat of the Adyar Library. The neat and expeditious printing of the Vasanta Press has placed me under a deep sense of obligation to the Superintendent, Mr C Subbarayudu

INTRODUCTION



THE word Dharma is one of the most comprehensive and important term in Sanskrit literature According to commentators it is explained as denoting an act which produces a result (to the soul) called *apūrvā*, the cause of heavenly bliss and final liberation. It has, however, been understood in ordinary usage to have a far wider meaning. The term has been used in various contexts to signify a prescribed course of conduct, duty, ordinance, statute, law, usage, practice, custom, customary observances of castes, religion, piety, justice, equity, virtue, morality, nature, character, a characteristic quality or peculiarity etc. Pūrvamımāmsā professes to teach *Dharma* exclusively.The work of Manu which is the standard treatise on Dharmaśāstra is the most familiar example specially devoted to the exposition of *[Dharma[^1]^(1[^1]).*

[^1]: "Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics, Vol IV. p 702 ."



The vedic meaning of the term--which is held to be derived from the root dhr(to uphold, to support, to nourish)-as sustainer included ordinances, and gradually extended its significance to include the meaning of fixed principles of conduct, and the whole body of *dharma* literature later on.²[^3] All dharmasūtras and the code of Manu describe the *dharma* of all the varnas and every dharma work is intended to explain the duties and obligations of the varnas.The fivefold classification of *dharma* adopted by Medhātithi is followed by Vijñāneśvara inhis Mitāksarā, by Haradatta on Gautama and by Govindarāja on Manu¹[^4].This fivefold classification under varna-dharma, āśrama-dharma, varnāśrama-dharma, naimittika-dharma and guna-dharma is occasioned by the very first verse in the Yājñavalkyasmrti.²[^5]It is in this sense that the word *dharma* is understood in *Dharmaśāstra*.

BACKGROUND OF DHARMAŚĀSTRA



The first and ultimate source of Dharma is the Veda or *śruti[^6]^(3[^6])*. To the Hindu the Veda is the source of all knowledge and religion. It enjoins actions to be performed and enumerates actions which are inhibited. The rules for the conduct of daily life are laid down according to the Veda. The entire Veda is the source of *Dharma* and no part of it can be rejected on the ground of being inconsistent in teaching. If there is issuch a difference in the Veda itself, it is explained as giving permission to both the practices as in the case of *udita* and *anudita* homas⁴[^8]. Dharmaśāstra comes next and derives both its inspiration and matter from the *śruti*or Veda. Those whose knowledge of the Veda was unquestioned could expound it without in any way conflicting with the vedic practices. As such, their exposition was authoritative. Excepting the code of Manu which is attributed to the father of the race all other works have been composed by sages of approved merit and knowledge of the *śruti*. But a preeminence has been assigned to the code of Manu and any *smṛti*which contradicts Manu is not considered as good for being followed in actual

[^6]: "3 Manu, II, 6"

[^8]: "Ibid, II, 15"

life¹[^9]. Thus dharma literature dealing with the life of the people of the land, laying down the rules for the daily life and occupations of the people in the minutest details entered into all the aspects and spheres of human action such as economic, social or religious, Its all-pervasive character has made it coextensive with the Veda in authority and spirit[^10]^(2[^10]).

[^9]: "1 Brhaspatismrti, G O S LXXXV. P २३३ः    वेदार्थप्रतिबद्धत्वात् प्रामाण्य तु मनोः स्मृतम् ।  मन्वर्थविपरीता तु या स्मृतिः सा न शस्यते ॥"

[^10]: "It is only during the days of the British administration that Dharmas āstra has come to be looked down upon by the secular state and set aside Islands of territory have continued to exist administering dharma rules in various spheres of life in the states until very recent times. Such a living s āstra, in spite of the vicissitudes during foreign rule, furnished the standard code when the administration of the East India Company started on its adminstrative career."

 The *smṛtis* therefore set forth the ideal of life both in this world and in the world above---as obtained from a knowledge of the Veda. Any lapses could not be condoned and had to be expiated Such expiation was through vedic rites in which vedic mantras were utilized for the purpose.



 One of the basic assumptions of the Hindu view of life is that life is eternal. The soul or ātmānever perishes though the body or *śarīra* which it occupies dies. The soul is reborn several times through its own karma and continues to function birth after birth till it attains liberation or *moksa.* The self is related to Paramātmā or Supreme Soul . The good or bad actions of a soul follow it by an eternal and inexorable moral law of the universe. The doer vanishes but the deed survives and adheres to the self or *ātmā*—the real doer. The important incidents in the life of a person good or bad are the result of the past actions of the individual which have moulded his desti

ny in the present life. These go by the term *pūrvajanmavāsanā* recognized by vedāntins. One rises up or falls

down in the ladder according to the good or bad actions that he performs in his lives. One has to work out his karma and the moral law is so inexorable that there is no escaping it *Moksa¹*[^12]")is the release from the cycle of births and deaths which result in rebirth. Any one incarnation is only a hyphen in the long history of its existence, a short interval in the awesome prospect of viewing the past incarnations or the future ones that stretch forward and backward to eternity. To be born is to court pain *(dukkha)*. To be released from the cycle of births is therefore the object of a proper lıfe lived by following the precepts of Dharmaśāstra which embody the vedic teachings. Man is the only rational being among God's creations. He alone has the capacity to lift himself to the position of the gods by his own effort. But this goal is defective in as much as when the *punya* or merit which he has acquired through good actions is exhausted like oil in a lamp, he is sent back to the earth, to begin a new cycle of births and deaths. The highest bliss is not derived from residence in the Heaven of Indra. For, the span of the life of an Indra is only one-fourteenth of the day of Brahmā.The aim is to attain a position for the soul, after the weary march through several births, from which there is no return, which is commonly called *Parama Padam* Reincarnations can be accepted as good if they help in such an ascent. The ascent to the *Pitṛloka* is known by the name of *Dhūma-yāna* and the path of the soul which does not return to the earth, *Deva-yāna²*[^13].

In the attempt to attain the object of liberation one has to prepare himself by living through a full life in this world according to the precepts taught by the Dharmaśāstras

This brings us to a consideration of the varnāśrama scheme which is the special contribution of our literature to the world. The first three varnas--the Brāhmana, the Ksatriya and the Vais'ya form the bulk of the society. The first varna (representing the intellect of the community) is devoted to a dedicated life of studying the vedas and mastering the entire literature and to act as the teachers of the community. The second (representing the strength of the community in its physical aspect) is entrusted with the duty of protecting the country and the people. The third--the Vais'ya-was economically the most affluent as it thrived on trade and agriculture and was the main stay of the social structure. The fourth varna the S'ūdra was to assist the first three in the discharge of their duties. No special teaching or schooling was essential for his uplift. He had no daily routine to attend to, the negligence of which entailed sin. This aspect is figuratively explained in the *Purusasūkta hymn* where the origin of the castes is stated as emanating from the mouth, the arms, the thighs and the feetof the *Purusa*. No one can stand or walk without the feet and the thighs, and to the community, the Vaiśya and the Śūdra are as important as the thighs and feet are to the human body. A regulated life within the varnāśrama scheme, according to the principles laid down in the *dharma* works, gradually lifted itself up to the highest bliss by its own merits.  
The scheme of the *āśramas* was no less important or significant. To the first two varnas the first three *āśramas* were open¹[^14]. The fourth *āśrama*was open only to the Brāhmana. To the Ksatriya the fourth, and to the Vais'ya the third and fourth *āśramas* were barred as they would be diverted

from the most useful occupations of protection of the people (*Prajāpālana yajña*) and increasing the economic prosperity of the community, through trade and agriculture. The rise of the new schools of thought opened the fourth *āśrama* to all the people by the spread of Buddhism and Jainism. Consequently, the social equlibrium must have suffered from an unequal distribution of the population in the various economic spheres of activity. The importance attached to the duty of protection can be seen in the exemption given to war materials and Elephants which are made unpunishable for acts of trespass and are called prajāpālas¹[^15].  
The most important *āśrama* common to all the varnas was the *grhasthāśrama.* According to Manu the *grhasthā*is the *śrestha* and he alone supports the whole society. The *Brahmacarya āśrama* is the period of preparation for lite in the world. The *vānaprastha* and the *sanyāsin*get out of the life of the *grhastha* and live in the forests or the outskirts. The householder lives in villages and towns, and as neither the Brahamacārin nor the sanyāsın has the right to cook food for himself the *grhastha* has to supply their food as well besides his own requirements. He performs the sacrifices and śrāddhas for the satisfaction of the gods. He is competent to procreate children and it is part of his duty to continue the race. Thus the *grhasthāśrama* is the only *āśrama* which is capable of discharging the three natal debts with which a person is born. The doctrine of the purusārthas-*Dharma, Artha, Kāma* and *Moksa* apply to him with equal ease. To the Brahmacārı, Dharma alone applies and to the last two āśramas the last *purusrātha* alone applies. It is to the *grhastha* that all the four pususārthas can apply without infringing dharma rules. The whole community depended on the *grhastha* (householder)Liberation entails the observance of varnśārama rules scrupulously, and a householder who has led a disciplined life with special merit is assured liberation. The path to liberation is provided by the varnāśrama scheme in easy stages for an upward march .This is the reason for the praise bestowed on the second *āśrama¹*[^16].

Every dharma samhita is divided into three sections for convenience into ācāra, vyavahāra and prāyaścitta sections. The Dharmasūtras and the metrical law books follow the scheme more or less though not exclusively. But the digests of dharma have made the division a recognized one. In some cases, works are attributed to the same author *e g*, Āpastamba where a group of six chapters forming an independent work deals with daily rites and śrāddha and another group of ten chapters deal with expiations or prāyas'citta²[^17] and M N Dutt (Vol I, pp 405-423), and in the Anandasrama Collection (No. 48) with the title Smrtināmsamuccayah, (pp 35-45).")The *Smrti* of Yājñavalkya is the standardfor this three-fold division. In later metrical smitis this division has been consciously adopted.

In the well ordered scheme of life through the āśramas which take their roots in the Vedas, any dereliction of duty enjoined was a sin, as each one was a violation of Dharma either of omission or of commission. The law of Karma being inexorable, such omissions had to be expiated either by other births or by penances in this very birth. These sins may offend only Dharma or may be against other individuals. In the latter case it offended both God and man. Civil as well as criminal offences have thus, apart from the cognizance which the courts take note of, a spiritual significance which could not be escaped. One may hoodwink a human judge, but the ever-vigilant. Dharma with his never failing witnesses can not be given the slip¹[^18].The gravity of the offence will have to be taken into consideration and the more grave the offence the larger the number of births that one had to undergo. Genuine repentence was recognized but any insincerity in the expiatory ceremony or pretence was not tolerated[^19]^(2[^19]). Confession was one of the methods by which expiation was permitted. The Christians have been practising it for long.

INTRODUCTION



Of the several methods of expiation or *prāyaścitta* Manu has enumerated five as important such as confession, repentence, tapas (austerity) adhyayana (recitation of the veda), and dāna (charity)¹[^21]. These ultimately resolved themselves into the existing functions of the castes and hence *prāyaścitta* only meant a more zealous pursuit of the duty of each person in his own varna and āśrama. Heavier penalties and prāyaścittas are proposed for very serious sins and smaller penalties and prāyaścitta for the smaller offences. Non-performance of *prāyāścitta* entailed in certain cases loss of caste and reinitiation2[^22].  
The function of the classification into ācāra, vyavahāta and *prāyaścitta* is not for the sake of convenience only . There is a *rationale* behind it. Many mistakes are committed in the course of our lives and some of them are very small or very big . The law of Karma being inexorable, the bad effects of bad actions cling to the soul. In an age when the belief in future lives was prominent and attempts were made to correct mistakes by undertaking penances for expiating sins, the attitude was one of faith in the efficacy of these expiatory rites. The belief was that there were two sides to every sin. One was the punishment which had to be undergone for committing the sin. This was physical. In the case of theft the king's jurisdiction over the thief was physical and punishment purified the offender. In cases where moral lapses of a serious nature were concerned or crimes which required both physical punishment and spiritual penance, to deprive the offender of the

opportunity of correcting himself by denying him the right to perform expiatory ceremonies was a more serious punishment than the physical one. For, it deprived him of the possibility at any stage of reclamation to society. The outcaste was one who suffered from this disability. *Prāyaścitta* had therefore an important part to play in the regulation of the life of the people.  
*Prāyaścitta* enabled the moral offender who realized his mistake and was repentent to retrace his steps back to his original position and start afresh. A denial of the opportunity would mean eternal damnation, and Hinduism was( in principle) against any person being shut out from legitimate opportunities of spiritual uplift, which alone mattered Every other thing was transient and *Dharma* alone remained to accompany the soul in its weary march¹[^23]. The *Gautama-dharma-sūtra pariśistā*which is now presented as edited from two manuscripts available in the Adyar Library Nos 8 D 55 and 24. G 18 presents the prāyaścitta part of Gautama.

GAUTAMA-DHARMA-SŪTRA



The *dharma-sūtra* of Gautama is the earliest work known Unlike the *dharma-sūtra* of Baudhāyana and Āpastamba it iswholly written in prose, Baudhāyana and Āpastamba have verses interspersed in their works. Gautama is referred to in the works of Baudhāyana, Āpastamba, Manu and Yājñavalkya²[^24] . The antiquity of the work as the first *dharma-sūtra* has not been in dispute though there has been differences of opinion as to the later revisions of the work. The view of Dr Batakrishna Ghose has been examined by MM Kane and as the arguments advanced by Dr Ghose are met by Prof. Kane, the antiquity of Gautama's work as the first *dharma-sūtra* must pass muster1[^25] .

EVOLUTION OF DHARMAŚĀSTRA LITERATURE



In the evolution of dharma literature a few well-marked stages of growth have been recognized. The first stage coincided with the evolution of the *Kalpa-sūtras* of Āpastamba and Baudhāyana, i e, the manuals of Vedic ritual in complete sūtra form in its various sections of Śrauta, Grhya, S'ulba, and Dharma. At the time of composition, the last part was perhaps not so important. We have *Kalpa-sūtras* only for three schools e g, Āpastamba, Baudhāyana and Hiranyakes'ın, belonging to the Krsnayajurveda. The theory that specific dharma-sūtras belonged to specific vedas has been cited by the *Carana-vyūcha* but the theory that every dharma-sūtra forms part of a *Kalpa-sūtra* has not been so favourably accepted. The *Gautama-dharma-sūtra* is assigned to the Rānāyanīya school of the Sāma Veda and no *Kalpa-stūtra* has so far been discovered to which it could be related. Hence the theory has been discarded by Prof Kane. The *dharma-sūtras* have to be interpreted as forming integral parts of dharma literature and came to be accepted as applicable to all.



The next stage is to be seen in the compilation of versified *smrtis* which amplify the sūtra literature and these do not belong to specific schools. The topics dealt with in these supplement one another. The third stage is that of commentators like Medhātithi, Asahāya, Viśvarūpa and others who attempt to interpret the smrtis in a homogenous mann

er

and avoiding any conflict of opinion in consonance with the rules of interpretation. The fourth and the fitth saw the emergence of the *commentaries* and the *nibandhas* and the*bhāsyas* which by themselves can be regarded as digests *eg Mitaksarā of Vijñāneśvara[^26]")¹.*

[^26]: "1Krtyakalpataru, Brahmacārıkāṇda, Introduction, pp 6-8 (Edited by Prof K v Rangaswami Aiyangar

In the process of such an evolution, each dharma-sūtra must have sought the help of others to fill up the gaps in its own literature. The general principle of accepting rules as workable and applicable to all in cases where specific directions have not been laid down in their own dharma literature--*anuktam anyato grākyam*--a piinciple which is accepted in other branches of literature, should have operated²[^27]. It is all the more important in cases where the dharma literature did not have other parts like the *śrauta*, *grhya* or *śulba* parts as in the case of *Gautama-dharma-sūtra*

[^27]: "2This principle is accepted in the case of Āgama literature for purposes of worship in the temples of South India."

We have three editions of *Gautama-dharma-sūtra* (1) No 61 of the Anandasrama Series with the *bhāsya* of Haradatta, (2) of which there is also a Telugu edition, (3) and with the commentary of Maskariin the Mysore Series. Editions of the *sūtras* alone are many and have not been recounted here.



Of these, the Mysore edition contains, besides the text and commentary, a section--*Kriyākānda*--in eighteen chapters³[^28], PP 457-475 Telugu edition, Madras, 1927, PP 489-514").The content of the *Kriyāknāda* is to treat about the *ācāra* part as to the daily routine from getting up in the early morning, *danta-dhāvana,* *snāna, japa, homa, pūjā* etc. This is also found in the Telugu edition (1927) . The *Kriyāknāda* is contained in the two manuscripts of the Adyar Library as the 1st *praśna* of the *pariśista.* The *second* *praśna* is the unprinted portion and is now published.

The *dharma-sūtra* of Gautama contains sūtras which are relevant to the portion covered in the *pariśista* but which are brief. The explanation has to be sought here in the second *praśna* for a

fuller treatment. The sūtras do not mention any names of writers. On examination it is possible to find parallel passages in both *Manu* and *Yājñavalkya*, as also Vasistha and Visnu. Such passages have been furnished as footnotes under the relevant sūtras in the text. The work is quoted with approval by Vijñāneśvara commenting on *Yājñavalkyasmrti* in his *Mitāksarā* (III, 216)¹[^29]and half of a section of the*parisiśta* is quoted with slight changes in the order of citation *verbatun* Mādhava commenting on Parāśara, quotes the same sūtras under Gautama (*Parāśara-Mādhavīya,* Vol II. pp 514-8).

The repetition of the last words is to denote the end of a section. The word *Kriyākānda* in the sūtra has been taken to be title of the portion by the editor of the *Gautama-dharma- sūtra* in the Mysore series. But the editor of the work in the Telugu edition puts the following colophon

The second *praśna* which is now presented for the first time, attempts to describe whatever has been left out in the *dharmasūtra* to which it is attached. It limits itself to the *prāyaścitta* portion which has not been elaborated in the *Gautama-dharma- sūtra.*  
In the composition of the work, the *Pariśista* has borrowed a great deal from the works of Manu and Yājñavalkya, Other works on Dharmaśāstra have also been utilized such as Visnu, Vasistha, Paithīnası, Hārīta, Śankha, Baudhāyana etc. An entire section on 'Dreams' has been bodily taken from the *Matsyapurāna*. The verses of the *Matsyapurāna* have been rendered into prose in sūtra style in the order in which the topics are cited in the verses³.[^36]

                MANU AND YĀJÑAVALKYA



The *Pariśista* follows Yājñavalkya in the main, both as to the matter taken and the arrangment. Beginning from verse 131 of the third chapter of Yājñavalkya the *Pariśista* unfolds itself as it proceeds to deal with the various topics. In many places in the first five chapters, and in other places, verbal identity of the *sūtras* to the verses of Yājñavalkya is clear. In fact the many textual difficulties which the two manuscripts presented were overcome by a close study of the Pan *Pariśista* with the *Mitāksarā*of Vijñaneśvara, which had utilized the *Pariśista* to the fullest extent.  
The extent of borrowing from Manu is also considerable. Manu has been accepted wherever Yājñavalkya has not touched the topic and laid down the rule (chap 2, *sūtras* 9-12). A similar instance can be seen in chapter 6, *sūtras* 3 to 6 where sins entailing loss of caste are enumerated. Where there is a difference of opinion between Yājñavalkya and Manu, the *Pariśista*follows the former¹[^37]


[^37]: "See footnote No 10 of p१९ infra"


OTHER WORKS



Apart from passages which have been cited for comparative study from Visnu in the footnotes, one passage of interest has to be noted. This occurs in chapter 6, *sūtras* 1 and 2 under the topic *atipātaka* and *anupātaka.* The same topic is dealt with in chapter 5 under *sūtra* 4 and the same view is cited by Yājñavalkya . But the repetion of the same topic in chapter 6 is under a different classification which is supported by Visnu. The *Pariśista* has accepted both the views under different classifications.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Remarkable identity of passages between the *Pariśista* and Vasistha are noticeable. These can be seen under chapter 7, *sūtra* 6, chapter 9, *sūtras* 5-10, chapter 14, *sūtra* 6-7, chapter 20, *sūtra* 9 etc. Similarly, identity of passages with Yama is found in p ६०, Sankha, pp १२-१४, ३२, ५१,८६, Hārīta, pp ३७-८, ७९-८०, Devala, p ६२. Two *sūtras* have been bodily borrowed from *Āpastambadharmasūtra* (chapter 8, *sūtra*1 and chapter 11, *sūtra* 11). Other writers whose verses have been rendered into prose or reproduced with slight variations have been shown in the footnotes in the relevant places. The list given above is only illustrative but not exhaustive  
The *Gautama-dharma-sūtra* contains an extra chapter in the editions of both Jivananda and M. N Dutt. This chapter has been omitted in the standard editions of the work issued from Mysore and Poona as neither Maskari norHaradatta has commented on the chapter. The *Pariśista* contains several of the *sūtras* found in the extra chapter. Out of a total 31 *sūtras* only 13 *sūtras* do not find their counterparts in the *Pariśista*. They are cited below

There are eleven manuscript of the*Gautama-dharma-sūtra* in the Adyar Library which contain this extra chapter and I have edited the chapter in the*Adyar Library Bulletin*( Vol X ,pp 206 208 with the help of these manuscript )




 DATE OF THE PARIŚISTA



There is no definite indication as to the date of the work Nor does the internal evidence furnish any further definite clue. The fact that the *Paris'ista* has borrowed largely from other works on *dharmas'āstra* definitely pushes back its date to the centuries after the Christian era. The chapter dealing with *Svapna* (dreams) which is definitely borrowed from the *Matsyapurāna* will bring it further down to the Gupta times when the *purānas* took their present shape he earliest work which cites the*Paris'ista* is the *Mitāksarā* of Vijñāne*s'*vara. In fact, it is not too much to say that in several cases the *Mitāksarā*, in commenting on Yājñavalkya has taken the clue from the *Paris'ista* Illustrative instances can be found in p 6, under *sūtra* 7, p. 9, *sūtra* 14, p 27, *sūtras* 16 and 17, pp 32-33, *sūtras* 7-12, p 35, the last *sūtra*of the 7th chapter and the first *sūtra* of chapter 8, p 36, *sūtras* 3 and 4, p 39, *sūtras*16 and 21 etc. Commenting on Yājñavalkya III, 216, Vijñānes'vara has quoted over half of a section of the*Paris'ista.* The work had therefore attained to a position of authority by the time of Vijñānes'vara. Neither Medhātithi nor Vis'varūpa has quoted this *Paris'ista*. The argument of silence is at best only a partially correct view and cannot be pushed to the logical extreme. Under the present state of our knowledge all that we can say is that about A D. 800 may be the latest date that can be assigned the *Gautama-dharma-sūtra-Paris'ista.*
