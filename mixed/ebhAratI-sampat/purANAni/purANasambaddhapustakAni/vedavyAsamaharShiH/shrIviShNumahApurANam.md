INTRODUCTION

 The Visnu_Puranam is one of the most inportant of the ectant Puranas. It belongs ot the Pancaratra Sact and is the best representative of the whole class of sevtarian Puranas, since it is eminently Vaisnava in its teaching from beginning to end and yet retains with considerable faithfulness the character of the old unsevtarian Puranas. In spite of the character, it contains, like the other Puranas Several chapters on Smrti-matter.(1) It appropriates to legends and panegyrics, a comparatively insignificant portion of its contents. From the philosophical point of view, it stands next to the Bjagavat_Purana which finds the first place amont thisw type of Puranas. Being the main source of the Vaisnava Philosophy, it has been profusely quoted as an authority and examples have been cited from it, by Acarya Ramanuja in his Sribhasya.(2)

 The date of the Visnu_Purana cannot be fixed with vertainty.
Scholars have expressed different views about it. Pargitar say: "It is a late Purana conposed as a single whole upon a consistent plan and not a collection of materials of various times, as we find of the Vayu, the Brahma and the Matsya. From its account of Buddhism and Jainism it appears to have been composed after Brahmanism had recovered its supremacy, so it cannot be earlier than about the fifth century A.D., and it is Brahmanical. "Farquhar holds, "The Harivamsa, clearly cannot be dated later than A.D400; and the Visnu Purana is so like it in most of its features that it is probable that it belongs is os like it in most of its features that it is probable that it belogs to the same general date." Winternitz says: "Pargiter may be right in thinking that it cannot be earlier than fifth century A.D. However, I do not think that it is much later." On account of its mention of Kailakia or kainkila Yavanas, Vaidya assigns a date later than 400 A.D. According to Hazra, the date of composition of the Visnu_Purana falls between the ned of the first and the middle of the fourth century A.D., i.e., between 100 and 350 A.D. The nature of the Smrti centents of this and alterations have been made in it much less freely than in the Purana, as compared with those of the Markandeya, as compared with those of the Markandeya, tends to show that former is later. So it is highly probable that the Visnu Puranam was written in the last quarter of the third or the first quarter of the fourth century A.D.(3)

 The Visnu_Purana is small in size but great in importance. It contains six amsas or books divided into 126 adhyayas (chapters). According to the Naradiya Purana, it consists of 24000 verses. But Vallalasena Speaks of 23000 verses The present Visnu_Purana contains only 6030 or 7000 stanzas. Three important commentaries of Sridhara, Visnucitta and Ratnagarbha have come down ot us.(4) All the other Puranas being compilations, the Visnu_Purana can boast of its original charcter. It is the only Purana which conforms to the five wellknown characteristics of a Purana.(5) Of the extant Puranas, the Visnu_Purana has preserved the best text. Additions other Puranas. Consequently, the great majority of the verses quoted in the commentaries and Nibandhas from the Visnu_Purana or Vaisnava occur in the present text of the Purana. Its great fame and popularity enccouraged the composition of the suprious work of the same title and extent as those of the Visnu at a time earlier than the beginning of the twelfth century A.D.(6)

 There are at least seven ccopies of the Visnu_Purana, and in none of them is there anything to indicate that any portion is wanting. It was evidently written after Gupta kong who reigned in the 7th C.A.D. as it makes an historical mention of them. It also alludes to Bauddhas.(7)

 The Visnu_Purana is supposed to be related by Parasara, the grandson of Vasistha, to his disciple Maitreya, and dispenses with the usual machinery of Suta and the sages. It is declared in the first chapter, indeed, in the form of prophetic enunciation by Vasistha, that Parasara is the author of the Samhitas and the Puranas.(8)

 This first book of the extant Visnu_Purana contains twentytwo chapters. It opens with the dialogue between Maitreya and Parasara. He calls himself the son of Vasistha. It mainly takes into account creation, primary (Sarga) and secondary (Pratisarga). The first explaining how the universe proveeds from Prakrti or pradhana or eternal crude matter: the second, in what manner the forms of things developed from the elementary substances previously evolved, or how they reappear after their destruction. Both these creations are periodical, but the termination of the first occures only at the end of the life of Brahma, when not only all the gods and all others are annihilated, but the elements are again merged into primary substance, besieds which one only spiritual being exists The later takes place at the end of every kalpa, or day of Brahma, and effects only the form of inferior creatures, and lower worlds, leaving substance of the universe entire, and sages and gods unbarmed. The explanation of these events involves a description of the periods of time upon which they depend, and which are accordingly detailed. In the coeternity of spirit and matter, the theogony and cosmogony of the Puranas as they appear in the Visnu_Purana, belong to and illustrate system of high antiquity.(9)

 The course of elementary creation in the Visnu_Purana, as well as in the others appears to be taken largely from the Sankhya hilosophy, which was the doctrine of evolution as believed and taught by a certain school of Indian Philosophers in ancient times. This system claims that pure spirit cannot originate in impure matter, and denies thay anything can be produced out of nothing because there must of necessity be a material out of which a product is developed: and because every thing cannot occur everywhere at all times, and because anything possible must be produced from something competent to produce it. Thus curds come from milk, not water. Production is only a manifestation of what previously
existed.(10) But in the Puranas, the agency operating on passive matter is confused being exhibited in consequence of the all prevailing doctrine of pantheism and the partial adoption of the Vedanta philosophy which is based on pure pantheism.(11)

 It is repeatedly declared that Visnu, aas one with the supreme being, in not only spirit, but crude matter: and not only the but all visible substance and time. He is Purusa, spirit, Pradhana, Crude matter, Vyakta, Visible from and Kala, time. Brahma and Siva are, consistently from Visnu. During the intervals of creation Visnu exists independent of all connection or attributes and is beyond comprehension of human faculties. When disposed to ereate the universe, the elements, and senses generated by two sensible combinations of the deity are collected into an egg, floating on the water, in which Visnu again, as Brahma, is concealed, and from which he is seen to seperate, and arrange the constituent portions of the world. The system is therefore perfectly conformable to that anciently entertained as explained in the opening of Manu, substituting Visnu for Brahma.(12)

 The third chapter contains the usual division of time, from the twinkling of an eye to the period of a Kalpa. The fourth is an account of the Varaha incarnation, whence the Varaha kalpa, or actual great period derives its name. The fifth chapter contains a series of creations effected by Visnu, amounting to nine, followed by a more detailed account of the order in which several classes of beings sprang into existence, extending to sixth and seventh chapter consists of the creation of the chief characters of the Svayambhuva, the son of the self born is married to Satarupa, their children are two sons, Privavrata and Uttanapada, and two daughters Prasuti and Akuti. Akuti was married to Ruci, a Prajapati: their offspring were Yajna and Daksina, who though brother and sister were married and begot the twelve divinities called Yamas. Prasuti was married to the Prajapati Daksa: they had twentyfour daughters, all emblematical Sraddha(faith), Laksmi, Dhrti (fortitude), Tusti (content), Pusti (Satiety), Medha(apprechension)Kriya(action)etc, of these thirteen were married to Dharma(aequity): of the other eleven, nine were married to the nine rsis. Svaha was wedded to fire, and the collective Pitrs of progenitors had Sraddha, the funeral sacrefic for their spouse. The Puranas, in gereral, follow this acccount of the first race of createad beings with some modifications and additions. In the Visnu_Purana, the primitive motion is most faithfully respresented.(13)

 In the ninth chapter, we have a description of the churning of the ocean for the recovery of Sri and Amrta or ambroria, last gods in consequence of the anger of Durvasas with Indra, but more concisely than usual. The posterity of the rsis by the daughters of Daksa follwo. Next comes the long episode relating to Dhruva, the second son of Uttanapada, who for his devotion to Visnu, was elevated to the dignity of the polar star.

 The descendants of Dhruva are traced in the thirteenth chapter to the sixth Manu Cakususa, and from him by Uru, Anga, and VAena to Prthu, from whom the earth was named Prthivi; the fourth descent from Prthu consisted of the ten Pracetases and their son was Daksa the Prajapati, in new birth. This the father of the 60doughters, of whom 27 were the constellations, the lunar mansions, or wives of the moon, and thirteen the wives of Kasyapa, by whom the gods and demonds, men and animals, were produced. The remaining chapters of this section contain the accounts in datial of the origin of these races, from the daughters of Daksa married to Kasyapa. This sectkion of the work ends with the division of the universe under its respectivce regents; and praises of Visnu as the Supreme Being.(14)

 The second book containing sixteen chapters opens with a continuation of the kings of the first Manavantara; amongst whom, Bharata is said to have given a name to India, called after him Bharatavarsa. This leads to a detail of the geograhpical system of the Puranas, with mount Meru, the seven circular continents (dvipas) and their surrounding oceans, to the limits of the world; all of which are mythological fictions. In regard to Bharata, the case is different, the mountains and rivers which are named are readily verifiable, and the cities and nations that are particularised may also in many instances by proved to have had a real existence.(15) This book also contains an account of Patalas and Naraka, with the situation and course of the planets and the description of their several cars: that of the sun is very fully and curiously detailed. This description is equally mythological but it occasionally approaches to accuracy. The last chapters give a legendary account of Bharata, a Brahmin, who acquires true wisdom and thereby attains liberation. Its object is to inculcate the suppremacy of Visnu and the nureality of worldly existence, agreeably to the doctrines of the Vedanta philosophy.(16)

 The third Book of the Visnu_Purana comprising of eighteen chapters, deals with the arrangement of the Vedas and other writings considered sacred by the Hindus. It is of such importance to the history of Hindu literatutre, and of the Hindu religion. The sage Vyasa is here represented, not as the author but the arranger or compiler of the Vedas, the Itihasas and Puranas. His name denotes his character, meaning the arranger of distributor; and recurrences of many Vyasas, many individuals, who modelled the scriptures has nothing in it that is improbable except the fabulour intervals by which their labours are separated.(17) It treats of the regions of different than a bare enumeration of names, the appellation of the Manu, the Indra, the Gangas or classes of Devas, the seven sages, and the of the first, sixth, and seventh periods are of great renown. The persons of the remaining seven Manvantaras are prophetically detailed.(18) It also includes the story of Sanjna and Chaya, wivexs of the sun; Savarni son of Chaya, the eight
Manus, his successors, and appearance of Visnu in each of the four Yugas.

 The chapters from 3-7 of this section enumerate the twenty eight Vyasa. In the Dvapara age of every Mahayuga (aggregate of four Yugas), a sage appears, who makes new arrangement of these works, and is therefore called Vyasa. The Vyasa of the present period is Krsna Dvaipayana, the son of Parasara, and the twenty eight of the series, who is a minor descent or incarnation of Visnu itself. Next follows the treatment of the origin of the Vedas and Puranas with details. The Veda, it is said, was originally a ritual, containing ample instructions for the five great sacrifices or oblation to fire, at the hill and change of moon, and in every fourth month the offering of animals and libtion with the juice of the acid Asclepias; these five being doubled as Prakrti and Vikrti, or simple and modified, become ten, and these were the objects of the Vedas.

 The mode in which Vyasa is described as arranging the Veda implies its prior existence in separate portions, as he called to his assistance four persons severally aquainted with them, or Paila for the Rk Vaisampayana for the Yajur, Jaimini for the Sama and Sumantu for the Atharvan. The Rk, containing the Rcas or prayers used with oblation by the Hotr of officiating priest; the Yajur, comprising the formulae of the rite repeated by the Adhvaryu, the Sama, composed of the hymns chanted by the Udgata; and the Atharvan comprehending prayers and rites suitable for princes or the military order, repeated by the Brahman on their behalf.

 The Purana then gives an account of different Samhitas or collections of the prayers and formulae of each Veda, and their respective authors. The divisions of Vedas are also described here. The origin of the Puranas is here also ascribed indirectly to various individuals. Vyasa is said to have complited the Purana Samhita. He gave it to Suta and who in turn taught it ot his six disciples. They brought out their own recensions of the Purana samhita. A list of the Puranas is then given as usual omitting series.(19)

 The remainder of the book is occupied with the detail of the mode of worshipping Visnu, duties of different castes, religious student, householder, hermit, and mendicant, ceremonies to be observed at the birth naming of ac hild, of marrying, choice of a wife the types of marriages, perpetual oblations of householder,purifications, ablutions, libations, perpetual oblations; hospitality, obsequial rites; morning and evening worship, obligations, ceremonial and moral, Sraddhas, time and place for the performance of the Sraddhas, brahmins to be entertained at these rites, the food to be offered to the manes and food prohibited for these occasions. The book terminates with a legend called the Yama_Gita, the scope of which is shown that the spirits of those who have taith in Visnu are not to be approached by the messengers of Yama.

 The fourh book of the Visnu_Purana consists of twenty-four chapters. It deals with the genealogies of the royal families, commencing with the lunar and solar lineages, and terminating with the kings of the Kali age, until modern period. Chapters 1-5 of this section given an account ofdyanasties of Kings, origi of the solar dynasty from Brahma, Manu Vivasvata's sons, descendants of the sons of Vaivasvata, descendants of Saryati, legend of Kirata, descdndants, birth, of Iksvaku, his sons, line of Vikuksi, legend of Kakutstha, of Dhundhumara, of Yuvanasva of Mandhatr, of Narmada and Purukutsa, of risanku, of Sagara, of Rama and his descendants and those of his brothers, like of Kusa, kings of Mithila, legend of Nimi, birth of Janaka, sacrifice of Siradhvaja, origin of Sita, descendants of Kusadhvaja. Chapters 6-10 give the description of the kings of the lunar dynasty, orgin of Soma or the moon, birht of Budha and his marriage to Ila, leagend of Pururavas and Uravasi, sons of Pururavas, legend of Rcika and Satyavati, birth of Jamadagne and Visvamitra. Parasurama, sons of Ayus, Ksatravrddha, Dhanvantari, descendants of Raji, the legend of Nahusa.

 The chapters from 11-15 contain a detailed account of the descendants of Yadu. A curious story is interwoven into the portion that relates to Krsna, of his being falsely accused of having stolen a jem. It was given to Satrajit. He have it to his brother who was killed in the forest by a lion. Krsna killed the lion and found the jewel. He returned it to Satrajit who gav him in requuital his daughter in marriage. The killing of Sisupala by Krsna is also described here. Descendants of Turvasu, Druhyu, Anu, Puru, Kuru are described in the chapters from 16-20. While describing about Magadha kings, the Visnu_Purana says that from the birth of Pariksita to the coronation of Nanda 1085 years elapsed. Nanda precceded Candragupta 100 years and Candragupta, as identified with Sankrakottus, ascended the throne 316.B.C Pariksita was the grandson of Arjuna, consequently the war of Mahabharata occurred 1430 years before Christian era. From Candragupta to the accessinon of the Andhra princes three dynasties occupy an interval of 294 years. The Andhras, therefore commenced their rule about 20 years before Christ which agree well enough with the account of the Andhra, as given by Pliny about the end of 1st C.A.D According to the Purana, there were thirty princes, who reigned 456 years, which bring them to A.D.436. If this is correct, the Andhra Dynasty is imperfectly given. The succession of races which follows the Andhra is evidently confused and imperfectly. Seven distinct dynasties are detailed extending through 1930 years and two others through a period of 406 years. The Purana presents an interesting picture of the political distribution of India in its time. It appears that the Ksatriya rule was generally abolished, and that individulas of various castes, from Brahmins to Pulindass reigned in Magadha, at Allahabad, at Mathura,Kantipur, and Gangetic India. The Gupta, a Sudar family, ruled over part of Magadha and Devaraksita over the maritime provinces of Kalinga etc. the Guhas in another part of Kalinga and so on. The last four chapters of this book give an account of future kings of Pariksita family of Saisunagas, Andhrabhrtya etc.

 The fifth book of the Purana containing thirty-eight chapters is exclusively devoted to the life of Krsna. Although the story is told in the usual strain, yet there is this peculiarity that Krsna is never considered as one and the same with Hari; He is only an Amsavatara ofr Visnu; not a very distinguished one either, being only one of Visnu's hairs plucked off by himself at the prayers of the gods, to become incarnate in the conception of Devaki, to be born for the purpose of alleviating tghe distress of the earth. The war with the Jarasandha and adventures of Kalayavana are also described. It includes what may be supposed to typify some hostile struggle between Krsna and Sankara, as taking part respectively with Aniruddha and Banasura.

 We are also told that Krsna killed Paundraka, the king of Benaras, who usurped the title of Vasudava. His sons continued war with the help of Sankara of Saivas. They endangered Dvaraka city but were repleted and the holy city of Kasi burnt by discus of the Victor. This book ends with the destruaction of the Yadavas: Krsna being shot through mistake by a hunter, and his ascent to heaven.(20)

 The sixth and the last book of Purana contains onkly eight chapters. It gives an account of the dissolution of the world in both its major and minor cataclysms; and in the particulars of the end of all things by fire and water, as well as in the principle of their perpetual renovation, presents a faithful exhibition of opinions that were general in ancient world. The metaphysical annihilation of the universe takes place by the release of the spirit from bodily existence.(21) After describing the division of time into Kalpas etc., expatiates on the various pangs that flesh is heir to, and directs manking to the only remedy for them, faith in Visnu as the Supreme.

 The Purana enumerates twenty-eight hells, one of them being called the Krsna, or black hell, which is reserved for sinners who live by fraud or who trespass upon other people's lands. The last three chapters of this section deal with the means of attaining liberation, anecdotes of Khandika and Kesidhvaja, the nature of ignorance and the benefits of the Yoga or contemplation, acquirement of knowledge and the final liberation, The section closes with the narration of the merit of listening the Visnu-purana, glorification and prayer of Visnu.
