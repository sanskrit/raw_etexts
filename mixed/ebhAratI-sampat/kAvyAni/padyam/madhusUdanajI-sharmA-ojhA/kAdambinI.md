**INTRODUCTION**

 No scientist had ever the time to have a close look at the Vedas, Brāhmaṇas and Upaniṣads and understand in his own way what they are all about. No existing interpretations except those of Madhusūdan Ojha (of which most scholars are unaware) will convince him simply because they have never gone deep into the basic concepts which the Aryans had on Nature and her working, which alone will enable one to build up a logical picture of their culture, rituals, concepts, habits and beliefs. Actually the interpreters broadly fall into two main categories. The first one constitutes those who refuse to question the authority of the Vedas and take for granted whatever is said in them and the supporting literature like Brāhmaṇas, Upaniṣads etc. The second type could not accept the above position and at the same time could not discover the logic in many of the statements found in the Vedas and Brāhmaṇas. They therefore came to the conclusion that many of these statements are myths or stories and have no logical or factual basis Some of the scholars belonging to the first type have tried to find some reasoning in many Vedic statements but they have in our opinion miserably failed to find convincing explanation to many of the statements simply because they could not master the entire literature and connect up the passages properly in a coherent way The physical phenomena on the earth or in the atmosphere or the astronomical phenomena in the heavens described in their own way by the Maharṣis and couched in symbolic language could not be resolved by them. The technical words occuring in large numbers in the Vedic and Brāhmaṇic passages have posed the greatest challenge to the interpreters and it is here that no two interpretations agreed, The result has been that many passages were interpreted differently by different scholars. The Vedic Gods, for example as conceived by the Vedic seers are essentially forces of Nature taking part in the creation and maintenance of the universe But the symbolic language used by them as well as the glorification of these forces have misled many interpreters who could not understand their nature correctly. The authors of the six systems of philosophy based their theories on the authority of the Vedas but their conclusions differed from each other, thereby implying that the message of the Vedas can take divergent directions. Sankara, Ramānuja and Madhvācārya interpreted the Vedas Brāhmaṇas and Upaniṣads in their own way and arrived at divergent conclusions. This manoeuverability in the interpretations in course of time led to some serious consequences. For example *Rudra* and *Viṣṇu* which represent physical forces having complimentary functions in the creative process became gods of differing importance *Rudra* (Indra) represents Agni and *Visņu* represents the force that constantly feeds Agni with food (Soma) and promotes the creative process (Yajña). It is unfortunate that incorrect interpretation of these have led to the division of a single society into various factions which certainly was

not the intention of the Vedic seers. If only the post-Vedic priests bad the same spirit of enquiry of the Vedic seers and their earnestness to understand the various processes in Nature in order to derive maximum benefits from her wealth, things would have been far different and there would have been greater chances of development of scientific thinking during the post-Vedic period and several views and concepts of the Vedio seers would have been confirmed ormodified on the strength of more and more factual observations. It may be surprising to many that according to the Vedic seers the word '*Vedavit*' (knower of Veda) really refers to one who is conversant with many of the intelligentprocesses in Nature leading to constructive creation.In the absence of such anunderstanding, interpretation of Vedic passages underwent many ramifications with the result that today we have before us a huge mass of heterogeneous literaturerepresenting many schools of interpretation of Vedic passages. It is not out of place to briefly enumerate here the reasons for this state of affairs:

 1. There are many contradictory statements in the Vedas. Brāhmaṇas and Upaniṣads which if not understood in the correct perspective will lead to divergent conclusions when studied by different scholars.

 2. Most of the scholars have not realised the fact that unless the Vedas Brāhmaṇas and Upaniṣads are studied and mastered together with cross references a correct picture of the Vedio thought will not emerge.

 3. There have been certain basic concepts of the Aryans which have guided them in their compositions whether they belong to the Jñanakānda or the Karmakānḍa. Most of the scholars have hardly tried to unearth these concepts.

 4. Many technical words occur in the Vedas, Brāhmaṇas and Upaniṣads and unless their correct meaning is understood one is likely to miss the correct purport of many difficult passages occuring in the above literature.

 5. The arthavāda portion of the Brāhmaṇas invariably contain critical information for the proper understanding of the Vedio passages. These have been by and large neglected by most of the scholars.

 It is in the above context one has to view the contributions of Madhusudan Ojha. Here was a scholar who practically spent his entire life in Vedic research and in the process not only acquired encyclopaedical knowledge of theentire cross section of ancient sanskrit literature but also gave us real insight into Vedic wisdom. His writings cover a wide range of subjects, which can be broadly classified under four heads. viz., 1.Brahma Vijñāna 2.Yajña Vijñāna 3.Itihāsa and 4. Reviews (Samıkṣā) on specialised topics. It is most unfortunate that many of his writings have been lost to us. His exposition of the Bhagavad Gita is a very rare contribution to the understanding of the many secrets hidden in that

work. In our opinion, after Veda-Vyāsa and the authors of treatises (Samhita) nobody knew more about the real meanings of Vedio passages than Madhusudan Ojha. It is unfortunate that many scholars do not realise this fact simply because his approach to the understanding of Vedicpassages differs considerably from the one adopted by most of the scholars and therefore nobody has really taken pains to study his works in detail. It is not our least intention to say that what all Ojha said are convincing. There are interpretations by him which are difficult to get convinced For example Ojha has taken great pains to show that the Vedic seers did know that the earth is moving round the sun. If we carefully go through his quotations and arguments it is very difficult to get convinced of his explanations. But with all that, today his interpretations of the contents of the Vedas, Brahmaṇas and Upaniṣads and associated literature are the only ones most helpful in the correct understanding of Vedio wisdom. Especially for a scientist familier with ancient sanskrit literature, Ojha's contributions are the most helpful for getting a real insight into the wealth of knowledge possesed by the Vedic seers.

 Ojha had a rare capacity in the presentation of his analysis, which is characterised by brevity clarity and completeness. The secret of his success is due to his stuning analytical brain. Some of his statements are really very difficult to follow. but if persistent efforts are made to understand him, one is rewarded with rich dividends. An intelligent research worker will be able to read between the lines and get many of his doubts clarified. Nobody has presented the basic concepts of the Aryans so well as Madhusudan Ojha.

 One of his Samikṣā books is entitled “Parjanya Samıkṣā” which was supposed to be in two parts. It is unfortunate that the first part of this work is not available to us. Though it is doubtful whether Ojha wrote the first part at all, he did draw up a list of topics to be dealt with in the two parts separately, as we learn from his manuscript collection. Since the reader will be interested to know what these topics were, as drawn up by him, they are given below:

**पर्जन्यसमीक्षा**

|--------|--------------------------------|----------|--------------------------------|

| 2      | वसव्य शर्मण्य सपीति देवाधिकारः | 2        | निदानाधिकारः (गृहचाराधिकारः)   |
| 3      | यज्ञपरिभाषाधिकारः              | 3        | गर्भाधिकारः (आधानाधिकारः)      |
| 4      | यज्ञाधिकारः                    | 4        | गर्भपरिभाषादि (अवच्छेदाधिकारः) |

| 6      | इन्द्रवृत्रसंग्रामाधिकारः      | 6        | प्रतिगत्यधिकारः (उपपस्यधिकारः) |

 It is the second part that has taken the final shape as Kādambini, for which, the present article is expected to form the introduction. As Ojha himself explains in his beautiful introduction to this work in Hindi, Kadambini means a line of clouds (Meghamālā). It is only through clouds we can understand the sky conditions and forecast rainfall. These clouds reveal the activity of wind heat, moisture etc in their formation (cf. धूमज्योतिःस्सलिलमरुतां संनिपातः क्व मेघः' Kālidāsa). In this work Ojha has collected and presented in an orderly way what all our ancients knew about the nature and prediction of rainfall. True to the statement of Varāhamihira in his Bṛhatsambitā viz.,

**अन्नं जगतः प्राणः प्रावृट्कालस्यचान्नमायत्तम्।  
यस्मादतः परीक्ष्यः प्रावृट्कालः प्रयत्नेन॥**

“The living beings depend on food for their existence. The availability of food depends on the monsoon. Therefore the rainy season deserves careful investigation.”

the Vedic seers and post-Vedic scholars were very keen investgators of the monsoon and its vagaries. Every observation however remote it may be, mattered for them if they were convinced that it has some relation to monsoon performance. Particularly the post-Vedic scholars collected not only extensive meterological observations, but also other observations which were not strictly meteorological in character and used them for forecasting rainfall. All these things have been assembled in a very orderly way by Ojha in his Kādambini. No introduction to this invaluable work of Ojha will be complete unless we make an honest effort to present an account of what would have been presented by Ojha in the first section. That is, before we present the Tāntrika part of weather science contained in Kādambini, we shall attempt to present the Vedic part of it. Fortunately we have some help in this from the writings of Motilal Sharma who was an outstanding disciple of Ojha and who has written profusely in Hindi on the topics dealt by Ojha in his works. In other words, in this introduction we shall mainly present an account of the history of evolution of the subject of weather science in India right from the Vedic period upto about 1700 A. D. after which period modern meteorology was slowly introduced in this region by the foreigners.

 The very first stage of civilisation in man was marked by his efforts to understand his surroundings and to make use of their benificial aspects His first attempt in this direction was to produce food making good use of the available rainfall in the region. Though initially extreme phenomena like heavy rains, winds, cold and hot spells, droughts, floods, etc. appeared to him incomprehensible and hostile, he gradually tried to sort out the seasonal character of the rainfall and associated phenomena and started planning his agricultural operations accordingly Thus began in a oruđe way the development of weather science all over the world.

 In India, further development of this subject commenced in the early Rgvedic period. Starting from simple concepts based on keen observations of local weather. the subject developed rapidly, especially during the post-Vedic period in which the scholars acquired considerable skill in not only understanding weather phenomena in their own way, but also in formulating many rules for forecasting rainfall both on the long range and short range after collecting large number of observations. Due to the important role that monsoon played on production of food, considerable efforts were made to understand and predict the vagaries of the monsoon. The subject was particularly learnt with great interest in regions which were frequently affected by droughts like Rajasthan and Gujarat.

**THE YAJNA CONCEPT OF THE ARYANS**

 Veda Vidya has two important components. One is Brahma Vidyā and the other Yajña Vidyā. While Brahma Vidyā is concerned with the origin (*Mūlakāraṇa*) of the universe, Yaiña Vidyā is concerned with the manifestation of the universe and the various processes through which the living beings come into existence and are sustained The Aryans as keen observers of Nature saw the sun, the prime life giver on earth and the stars appearing on the firmament moving systematically without change in their lustre. They also saw the moon with its waxing and waning phases moving with respect to the stars and completing one full round of the sky in about a month. They contrasted their ephemeral existence and their stages of growth and decay with the unchanging nature of the sun and the stars and attributed some type of immortality (*amṛtatva*) to the celestial bodies as opposed to their own mortal nature. They understood the power of time measured in terms of the apparent motion of the sun, planets and the stars in the sky, the seasons and their attendant features coming in an orderly fashion as well as their cvcles. The importance of fire (Agni) was recognised by them and they worshipped it as their principal God in three forms *viz*.. Agni on the earth (*Pārthivāgni*), the Agni of the middle region (*Āntarikṣyāgni*) playing an important role in rainfall / thunderstorm and associated phenomena of the atmosphere and the Sun God (*Divyāgni*) in the heavens above. It did not take much time for the Vedic ṛsis to realise that the orderly functioning of the Sun God and the Gods responsible for the atmospheric phenomena, especially rainfall was very essential for their very existence and then their prosperity. From a stage of merely offering prayers they passed on to the next one of speculating about the origin of the solar system and of life on earth. In these speculations they struck at one important concept namely that the sun and the stars should be constantly fed with some food which is of divine origin and which maintains their brightness and therefore is responsible for their being immortal. The yaiña concept of the Aryans has its origin in this principle of feeding of Agni with food (Soma). (अग्नौ सोमाहुतिर्यज्ञः) (i.e, the effering of Soma

în Agni is ‘yajña' is perhaps the best definition of yajña. According to the Vedic seers the entire universe is created and sustained on the Agni Soma interaction principle. Agni is referred to as annāda (eater of food) and Soma as anna (food) (सोमो वै अन्नं अग्निरन्नादः।) In the Vedas, the milky way in the high heavens was identified with Soma 2 and is called ‘*Soma dhārā*’, the stream of Soma, It is this white substance encompassing the upper heavens which serves as food to the burning stars and the sun and makes them shine 3. They recognised a three fold existence for Soma *viz*., 1. Soma dhārā (milky way in the heavens), 2. Soma the moon and 3. Soma juice which is extracted from the Soma plant. A careful study of relevant passages in the Vedas reveals that the latter two are only replicas (*pratikṛti*) of the soma substance which forms food for Agni; as a result of which creation proceeds. Agni and soma exist initially in the shapeless form (*rta*) and when a centre of creation appears, ta soma feeds ṛta agni and an object of creation comes into existence which is termed ‘*Satya*. that is having a definite shape as opposed to the shapeless rta state. In fact whether it is the birth of the solar system or the occurrence of seasons and rainfall, or the birth of the child or plant. the process at work is vajña in which a substance of the soma category is absorbed or consumed by or intercourse with a substance of the agni category. This has been a basic and important concept that runs through the entire Vedic Brāhmaṇic and Upaniṣadic literature. The sum and substance of this concept is contained in the Gita verse,

**सहयज्ञाः प्रजास्सृष्टा पुरोवच प्रजापतिः।  
अनेन प्रसविष्यध्वं एष वोऽस्त्विष्टकामधुक्॥**

“Having created the subjects (prajāh) togother with yajña, Prajapati told them, procreate using this process (yājña) and let it bestow on you whatever you want".0)

 The very first cosmio yajña was conceived to have been performed by Prajāpati himself who created all things out of himself. Thus the yajña ritual became the first sacred act of the Devas 4 and then also for men on earth who professed to perform the ritual exactly in the same way as was done by the Devas. *Yajna vidyā*, *Sṛṣti vidyā* and *Veda vidyā* are all synonymous.

 The Agni-Soma concept is further elaborated in the structure of the four lokas. Using the ahargaṇa unit of the Vedas and Brāhmaṇas, from the surface of the earth upto the nineth ahargaṇa constitutes the Agniloka, in which region *Pārtkivāgni* prevails. From 9th to 15th ahargaṇa is the region of *Vāyuloka* or *Antaribṣa*. Here Agni is in the rta from and all the atmospheric processes, the chief of which is rainfall take place in this region. From 15th to 21st ahargaṇa is the *Adityaloka* or *Dyan*, the sun being located at the 21st ahargaņa. From 21st to 33rd ahargaṇa is *Apoloka* (the region of primordial waters). It is the region where the some substance prevails and is stratified into two layers. From

21st to 27th ahargana is the *Parameṣthi* region containing *Pavitra* soma or unpolluted soma and from 27th to 33rd ahargana is *Vāruṇa* soma which is *dūṣita* soma or polluted soma. The pollution is conceived to be due to āsura (evil) forces as opposed to divine forces present in the Paramesthi region It is the feeding of the *Parameṣṭhi* soma that sustains the sun and gives it brightness. It is this soma that the brāhmaṇas were after, in order to attain immortality.

 The division of *Āpoloka* into two regions the one containing pure soma and another containing *dūṣita* soma or *Vāruņa* soma has its origin in the fact, on earth we have certain snow bound regions which supply pure water, which flows to the plains while there are some other regions which are either ocean areas or areas where the water is permanently blocked in ice packs and glaciers and therefore are not available for use.

 The Vedic seers explained the occurrence of the various reasons in terms of agni-soma interaction. The northern side is the seat of heaven and the earth is to its south. They imagined that agni in *ṛta* form is located in the south and is always moving north. Soma is present in the north and is always moving southwards, This corresponds to soma coming down and agni (*Pārthivāgni*) moving upwards. There is a confrontation between the two and the seasons are produced as a result of either of the two asserting over the other 5 *Vasanta*, *Grīṣma*, *Varṣa*rtus show the assertion of agni over soma and reverse takes place during the other three *ṛtus*. The northerly movement of the equatorial trough (which later becomes the monsoon trough) during the three former seasons and the penetration of cold westerly trough southwards during the latter three seasons are suggested here.

 If the yajña performed by the Gods results in the birth of the solar system, the occurrence of the seasons, rainfall and life on earth, it logically follows that man whose prosperity and even whose very existence depend on the orderly behaviour of all these natural phenomena develops a technique for expressing his gratitude. This technique resulted in elaborate rituals which not only enabled him to propitiate Gods for his well-being but also afforded him & method by which he could demonstrate to posterity his concepts on sciences. In these demonstrations the atmospheric phenomena are given the cosmogony and life highest importance. Particularly since rainfall was essential for production of food, most of the rituals were intended for ensuring the occurrence of rainfallin sufficient measure. The following statements of Gitā 6 and Manusmrti 7 support the above idea.

**यज्ञाद्भवति पर्जन्यः पर्जन्यादन्नसंभवः।**  
Yajña produces rain and rain produces food'

**अग्नौ व्रास्तहुतिस्सम्यगादि समुपतिष्ठते। आदित्याज्जायते वृष्टिर्वृष्टेरन्नं ततः प्रजाः॥**

“An offering made properly to Agni reaches the sun and urges on him to produce rain. Rain produces food and food the living beings”

 The Samvatsara yajña (the birth of solar system) which contains in itself the occurrence of day and night, the waxing and waning periods of the moon (*sukla pakṣa and kṛṣṇa pakṣa*), the occurrence of the seasons (hot, rainy and cold) so important for the birth of life the production of food and the annual cycle of apparent motion of the sun in the celestial background were all inividually propitiated for ensuring their beneficial effects and avoiding their evil effects. In every one of the rituals like *Darsapūrṇmāseṣti*, *Cāturmāsyeṣtis*etc. appeal to rain gods for prosperity was very prominent ओ श्रावय, अस्तु औषट् यज ये यजामहे वौषट् which were uttered by the priests before making the offering to the gods was a direct appeal to them for rains (the Devas produced the easterly winds by uttering ‘*O Śrāvaya*’ They brought the clouds by uttering ‘*astu śrouṣat*’. They produced lightning by uttering ‘yaja' and thunder by uttering ‘*ye ynjamahe*' when they said '*vouṣat*' the rains fell. 9 Special rituals (like kārīrīṣṭi) were also performed when there was drought. In the soma yāga the omentum of the goat is smeared with ghee and is held in the fire with two sticks The following passage in Satapatha Brāhmaṇa is relevant here. (We give below only the translation of Eggeling)

 Thereupon the *Adhuaryu* having taken ghee with the dipping spoon pours it upon the omentum. May Agni graciously accept the ghee *swāha* (hail) Thus those drops thereof reach the fire after becoming cooked offering made with *swāha*,

 "He then says (to Maitrāvaruņa) Recite to the drops. He recites to the drops verses addressed to Agni. The reason why he recites to the drops verses addressed to Agni is that rain originates from gifts made from the earth, for from here it is that Agni obtains rain. By means of these drops (falling from the omentum) he obtains these (rain) drops and those drops rain down here. Therefore he recites to the drops verses addressed to Agni.10”.

 In fact it will not be unreasonable if one infers that the omentum when it is spread and held over the fire represents the overcast sky and the drippings the rain There are many sūktas in Ṛgveda in which the *ṛsis* earnestly appeal to the rain gods for rains and most of these have applications in the various rituals. The nineth mandala of Ṛgveda deals mostly with the preparation of the soma juice. If one goes through the rks carefully one cannot escape seeing in them a demonstration of the rainfall phenomenon where the soma particles capable of producing life on earth come down after mixing with rain water.

 There is another aspect of the yajña cult which deserves our attention.It was believed by the Vedic seers that the phenomens of the stmaepherenamely

seasons.winds, rainfall etc., giving rise to life on earth, is the result of the ‘*pravargya*’ (oozed out) portion or '*ucchiṣṭa*' portion of the sacrifice in the heavens performed by Prajapati, which means a constant loss of yajña retas (semen)of Prajapati In order to compensate for this loss (*kṣatipūraṇa*), sacrifices are performed in which the performer attuning himself mentally to the cosmic yajña gives his respectful offerings to the Gods and imagines that he puts back into the atmosphere whatever is lost by Prajāpati through the atmosphere. By this take and give process, the yajña cycle of the universe is imagined to be maintained. The following statements of Gital support the above idea:

**देवान् भावयतानेन ते देवाः भावयन्तु वः।परस्परं भावयन्तः श्रेयः परमवाप्स्यथ ॥  
इष्टान्भोगान् हि वो देवाः दास्यन्ते यज्ञभाविताः।तैर्दत्तानप्रदायैभ्यो यो भुङ्क्ते स्तेन एव सः॥**

“Please the Devas and let them please you. This mutual understanding gives you prosperity. The Devas propitiated with yajñas will give you what comforts you need He who does not return what he gets from them is considered a thief.”

 Another way of viewing the above aspect of yajň cult is as follows. The origin of life on earth is sun's radiation and rainfall. The sun is constantly shedding its heat to the earth and the life giving soma particles are coming down constantly through rainfall. It is natural for any intelligent man to think that unless there is some sort of cycle by which what is lost from above is returned in the reverse direction, this activity cannot be maintained. The Vedic rṣis discovered the yajña cult by which they wanted to put back into the atmosphere the very same particles of the soma category like ghee (replica of retas) fuel, food, omentum of goat etc by which the soma content is replenished and rainfall and regeneration of life is ensured on earth.

 To put it in yet another way, just like we are careful not to cause any damage to environment and encourage afforestation programmes for ensuring the proper functioning of the rainfall cycle our ancients believed in putting back into the atmosphere what they got from it, so that the rainfall cycle and therefore the life cycle goes on without break. The word ghṛta for water in Vedic passages is charactsitic of its capacity to produce life when it comes down as rainfall. It is very interesting to note that modern science lays much stress on the ionic balance of the atmosphere required for the healthy growth of life forms including vegetation. The required balance of excess of negative ions is actually produced through lightning and rainfall (thunderstorms)

**ORIGIN OF THE PRIMORDIAL WATERS (ĀPAH)**

 The soma substance which plays a vital role in the appearanes of life on earth represents one stage in the transformations undergone by the primordia

waters in the creation process. Therefore it is useful here to explain a little the Vedic view of the origin of these waters. According to this view, Prajāpati He alone was there created and brought into existence this observed cosmos. in the beginning and had two parts one is the mortal part and the other is the immortal one. This is evident from the followingBrāhmaṇa statements:

**“प्रजापतिस्त्वेवेदं सर्वमसृजत यदिदं किं च।¹²” “प्रजापतिर्वा इदमग्र आसीदेक एव।¹³”  
“तस्य ह प्रजापतेः अर्धमेव मर्त्यमासीदर्धममृतम्”¹⁴**

“It is Prajāpati who created all these around us,”

“Prajapati was alone in the beginning.”

“Prajapati had one immortal half and another mortal half”

 The mortal part is the cosmos brought into existence through the yajña process and the immortal part is called '*Satya*.' In other words the Satya Prajāpati manifested himself through the yajña process and created the cosmos. This *Satyātmā* is called Ṣodasipuruṣa as he has sixteen *kalās* or facets viz five kalās of Avyaya five of Akṣara, five of Kṣara and one *Parātpara*. Avyaya is the jñāna part and constitutes the principal support of the cosmos, Akṣara is the karma part and constitutes the efficient cause and Kşara is the matter part and constitutes the material cause of the universe. In the Purāņas, it is the Kṣara part of Prajapati that is called Brahma, whose five kalās are 1) *prāṇa*, 2) *āpah* 3) *vāk* 4) *anna* and 5) *annāda.* These constitute the five faces of Brahmā. He is called *caturmukha* since anna which is soma joins annāda which is Agni, who is also Rudra (रुद्रो वा एष यदग्निः) The Purānic story that Rudra cut off one of the faces of Brahmā only means that anna is taken away by *annāda*. As a result of *Sarvahuta yajña* involving these five *kalās*, five *Puranjanas* are born They are 1) *Svayambhū* which is prāņa type 2) *Parameṣṭhi* which constitute waters (āpah) 3) *Sūrya* which is vāk type, 4) Candra which is anna type and Pṛthvi which is annāḍa type. According to the Vedic seers, *Svayambhū* is responsible for the emergence of the Vedas, *Parameṣṭhi* for the creation of the *lokas*. sun for the creation of the Devas and Candra and Prithvi for creation of five elements (bhūtasṛṣti). It is from the Brahmāgni (Prāṇāgni) of *Svayambhū* that the primordial waters which constitute the *Parameṣthi* were created (परमेष्ठो वा आपः). The following statement in Manusmrti 15 refers to the same thing.

**सोऽमिध्याय शरीरात् खात् सिसृक्षुर्विवेधाः प्रजाः। अप एव ससर्जादौ तासु बीजमवासृजत्॥**

‘With a desire to create various living beings, Prajāpati meditated and produced waters first from his own body and in them he laid the seed.

These waters are in the *ṛta* state and have two components viz *Bhṛgu* and *Angiras*The *Bhṛgu* component has three states.In the dense state it constitutes Āpah, In the fluid state it constitutes Vayu and in the finest state it constitutes Soma.

Whereas the waters in the *Parameṣthi* region are called 'ambhah' they are called '*mara*' when they finally reach the earth through the souramandala. According to this view, therfore the waters available on the ground are linked to primordial waters of the Parameṣthi region. During the descent from the souramandala, they get attracted towards the Candramandala and it is for this reason the moon is called ‘*Soma pinda*’, ‘*ap pinda*’ etc. The waters reaching the earth again go up in the form of vapour due to the sun's heat and stay in the atmosphere for some time. They come down later as rain when conditions are favourable for the same.

**CONCEPTS OF RAINFALL PROCESS**

 That the heat of the sun lifts the water on earth to the atmosphere which after sometime comes down as rain was recognised by the Vedic seers at a very ealry stage. They conceived the rainfall process as a yajña taking place in the middle region (antarikṣa) and the rain drops were supposed to impregnate the earth as a result of which life comes upon earth. The Chandogyopanişat describes this yajña beautifully in five stages taking place in the regions comprising the souramandala, antariksa and the earth. We shall deal with this a little later. The rain God Parjanya who is closely linked with Indra in his main function of producing rain is described as a bull, who roars and impregreates the plants by depositing his *virya* (semen), in the following passages of the Vedas.

**अछा वद तवसं गीर्भिराभिः स्तुहि पर्जन्यं नमसा विवास।  
कनिक्रदद्वृषभो जीरदानू रेतो दधात्योषधीषु गर्भम्॥¹⁶**

 “Hail the mighty Parjanya, (0 priest) offer him food. He, like a bull roars and impregnates plants by depositing his virya (waters) in them. He is quick in granting what is asked for. (*Jiradānuh*).

 Picturesque description of the monsoon showers accompanied by winds thunder and lightning are also available in Vedas. 17, 18

 The 164th *sūkta* of 1st mandala of Ṛgveda contains someclear concepts on the rainfall process. The Kāririşti described in the Taittiriya Samhitaof Yajurveda has many interesting statements containing the concepts of the Vedic Ṛṣis on the rainfall process. Three *ṛks* of the *sūkta* mentioned above are relevant here for our study. They are

**सप्तार्धगर्भाः भुवनस्य रेतो विष्णोस्तिष्ठन्ति प्रदिशा विधर्मणि ।  
ते धीतिभिर्मनसा विपश्चितः परिभुवः परिपश्यन्ति विश्वतः॥¹⁹**

**कृष्णं नियानं हरयः सुपर्णाः अपो वसाना दिषमुत्पतन्ति।  
त आवृत्रन्त्ससदनाहतस्यादिद्घृतेन पृथिवी व्युद्यते॥²⁰**

**समानमेतदुदकमुच्चैत्यत्र चाहभिः। भूमिं पर्जन्या जिन्वन्ति दिवं जिन्वन्त्यग्नयः॥²¹**

 1. The rays of the sun hold for six months the waters capable of fertilising the earth, pervading the sky and wait for performing their duty (of drenching the earth with showers).”

 N. B. Motilal Sharma 19a has interpreted '*Saptārdha*' as six months and half of seventh month.

 2. “The rays of the sun following the dark (southern) path take the waters and move upwards (northwards). They turn back from the source of ṛta and drench the earth with waters.”

 3 “The waters go upward and come downward in the same measure during periods (of the respective seasons) Agni takes the waters to heavens and Parjanya brings them down as rain."

 One of the important aspects of rainfall which struck the Vedic seers living in extreme north west India and adjoining regions, was its occurrence during a restricted period of about two months in the same part of the year every time To explain this seasonal occurrence, they imagined that the sun's rays aborb the water from below and a certain period is required for the rays to get fullycharged with water, at the end of which they deliver the rains to the earth. This period is mentioned as about half a year or six months. The reason for the choice of six months will be clear later, when we deal with the developmentsduring the post-vedic period. The second rk does provide some clue for this. It goes into the source of this water. The Aryans living in extreme northwest India and quite familiar with the land mass located in the north were also aware that on the southern side there is a vast oceanic region providing ample scope for absorption of water by sun's rays whenever he moves to the south. They imagined that agni in the ṛta form is located in the south and always movingtowards the north. On the analogy of snow present in the northen latitudes they imagined soma to be present in the north and always moving to the south.This corresponds to agni moving up and soma coming down in the vertical. There is a constant confrontation between the two and the seasons are produced as a result of either of the two asserting over the other The dark path that is referred to here is the southward position of the sun The ṛta sadana here refers to the abode of ṛta that is Himalayas near which the sun attains his northernmost position. That is the position when the sun turns back his rays and retraces his path. With this background if we examine the second *rk*, it probably suggests that humid air moving northwards gets deflected near the foot of the Himalayas and pours down rain and drenches the earth. It is interesting to note here that there is a verse in Ramayana (Ayodhyakanda) which is almost a replica of this ṛk. It is

**उदग्गत्वाभ्युपावृत्ते परेताचरितां दिशम्। आवृण्वानाः दिशः सर्वाः स्निग्धाः ददृशिरे घनाः॥**

 The above model of tho rainfall process was further improved during the Yajurveda period. The description of the *Kāririṣti* in the *Taittiriya Samhita* of Yajurveda contains some interesting information. We quote below the relevant portions as translated by A B. Keith 22 with our modifications.

 1. “Thou are connected with Maruts, thou art the force of Maruts; ‘cleave the stream of waters!

 2. Hail (*swāha*) *Jinvarāvṛt* produced by east wind;  
Hail *Ugrarāvṛt* raining with winds;  
Hail *Bhaumarāvṛt* thundering and raining;  
Hail *Tveṣārāvṛt* thundering without lightning, lightning, raining;  
Hail *Pūrtirāvṛt*, raining overnight;  
Hail *Srutaravṛt* famed as raining much;  
Hail *Virādāvṛt* raining while the sun shines;  
Hail *Bhūparāvṛt* thundering, lightning, raining;'

 3. O *Vasarya* Gods, Agni, Soma, Surya, O *Sarmanya* Gods, Mitrā, Varuņa, Aryaman O Sapīti Gods *Apāmnapāt, Āśuheman;*”

 Give of the water, cleave the holder of the waters; from the sky,from Parjanya, from the atmosphere from the earth, thence do ye help us with rain.”

 4.Thou art connected with the Maruts, thou art the force of the Maruts (with these words) he puts on a black garment with a black fringe; that is the hue of rain; verily becoming of like hue he causes Parjanya to rain. Stay, O Maruts the speeding falcon' (with these words) he pushes back the west wind;verily he produces the east wind to win the rains. He makes offering to the names of the winds; the wind rules the rain; verily he has recourse to the wind with its own share; verily it makes Parjanya rain fo him. Eight offerings he makes, the quarters are four, the intermediate quarters are four; verily from the quarters he makes the rain to move. He unites (them) on a black antelope skin; verily he makes the offering; he unites within the vedi for accomplishment. When the Yatis were being eaten, their heads fell away; they became *kharjūras*; their sap rose upwards, they became Kariras; the kariras are connected with soma; the offering connected with soma makes rain move from the sky; in that there are*kariras* (in the sacrifice); by means an of offering which is connected with soma he wins the rain from the sky. With honey he unites (them); honey is the sap of the waters and the plants; verily it rains from the waters and plants; verily also he brings down rain from the waters and plants.

Gladdening, obedient’ (with these words) he unites (them); verily he approaches them by their names; just as one may say ‘Come hither N, N' so by their names he makes them move forward. Thou art the fetter of the strong horse; for rain yoke thee' he says; the horse is strong; Parjanya is strong; becoming black as it were he rains; verily he unites him with his hue, to win the rains.”

 5. O *Vasavya* Gods, O Sarmanya Gods, O Sapiti Gods. (with these words)he ties on; verily by means of the Gods he daily seeks rain. If it should rain. so much only should be offered; if it should not rain the next day, he should offer an oblation. Mitra and Varuņa are day and night, by day and night Parjanya rains, for by night or by day he rains; verily he has recourse to Mitra and Varuņa with their own share; verily they make Parjanya rain for him by day and night. To Agni hiding his abode, he should offer a cake on eight potsherds, to the Maruts on seven potsherds, to Sūrya on one potsherd; Agni thence causes the rains to arise, the Maruts lead it out when produced; when yonder the sun turns back with hisrays, then he rains; becoming a hider of his abode as it were, he rains: these deities are the lords of rain; them he has recourse to with their own share; they make Parjanya rain for him, even if he is not minded to rain yet he rains. ‘Let free the rain from heaven, with waters fill the ocean', he says; verily these and yonder waters he unites; then with these he approaches yonder (waters). ‘Thou art born of waters, first born; thou art the might of the ocean that is according to yajus Flood the earth’ (with these words) he offers *varṣāhva*plants. This of plants is that which wins rain and thereby he causes rain to fall. ‘The Gods whose portion is in the sky' (with these words) he shakes the black antilope skin; verily to him these worlds become dear and desired.”

 It is seen from the above passages that the Aryans had categorised therainfall of their region into eight types, *Jinvarāvṛt* etc. The appreciation of the fact that Agni, Vayu, (maruts), Sūrya and Soma are the principal agents in the occurrence of rainfall, is qu te evident from the above passages. They appealed to the Vasavya Gods Agni, Soma and Surya,*Śarmanya* Gods Mitra, Varuņa and Aryaman and Sapiti Gods, Apāmnapāt and *Āsuheman* 22a for the production of rainfall. It is also clear that they recognised the appearance of moist easterlies bringing monsoon and the simultaneous disappearance of the westerlies at thetime of commencement of rains during the rainy season The absorption of moisture from the oceans and the movement of moist winds northwards to give rain in their region at the time of the sun retracing his path after reaching the extremenorthern position were also recognised by them. However the most interesting thing in these passages is the elaboration of the role of soma in rainfallThe soma that comes down aids the fall of rain from the clouds. During the*Kāririṣti*, *karira* fruits are offered in the fire which probably produce dense smokewhich goes up and mixes with the clouds above It was the belief of the Aryans that this smoke having the property of soma wins the rain from the clouds. 23

In other words some sort of seeding of the clouds from ground is capable of producing rain because in Nature according to them the soma particles from above feed the clouds and extract the rain (*cyāvayati*) The soma feed from above produces lightning in the atmosphere which is referred to as Indra drinking soma.

 The soma feed causing rains to fall is also told explicitly in the Chandogyopaniṣat. While explaining the statement ‘पञ्चम्यामाहुतावापः पुरुषवचसो भवन्ति’ i.e.,‘ In the fifth offering (*āhuti*) man comes into existence', the *ṛși* goes into the details of the five yajñas taking place in the *Dyu-Antariksa-Pṛthivi* system resulting in the appearance of man at the final stage. The production of rainfall takes place at the end of the second yajña which takes place in the middle (*antarikṣa*) region. We have already seen that in a yajña union of soma with agni takes place resulting in the creation of a new object or entity. In the Agnihotra Karma which is the most basic yajña performed by the yajamana, though Agni, samit (fuel), *angāra* (cinder), *visphulinga* (spark), *havirdravya* (the milk that is offered) etcare involved, all of them can be brought under two distinct entities viz agni which is annāda (eater offood) and soma which is anna food). This *anna-annāda-bhāva* is the secret of maintenance of the created cosmos. The sun's brightness and its maintenance is due to the soma of the Paramesthi region which is called some times *Brahmaṇaspati*' It is essentially '*aptatva*' which is also called ‘*Sraddhā’*(श्रद्धा वा आपः). It is because of the deposition of the Sraddhā tatva that the sun is bright and without it the sun would have been a dark mass (*kṛṣṇa pinda*). This is the first yajña describedby the rsi. Actually the result of this yajña isthe appearance of soma which is another from of the Sraddha tatvs It is this soma that forms the offering for the second yajña which takes place in the antarikṣa region. The first yajña is beautifully described in the following passage of the Upanisat:

** असौ वाव लोको गौतम अग्निः।तस्यादित्य एव समित्।रश्मयो धूमाः। अहरर्चिः। चन्द्रमा अङ्गाराः।नक्षत्राणि विस्फुलिङ्गाः। तस्मिन्नेतस्मिन्ननौ देवाः श्रद्धां जुह्वति। तस्याहुतेः सोमो राजा सम्भवति।²⁴**

 "O Gautama, this loka is the Agni. For him Aditya forms the *samit.*His rays constitute the smoke. The radiance is the day. The moon is the cinder. The nakṣatras form the sparks. In this Agni the Devas offer *Sraddhā*. As a result of this offering King Soma appears.

 We see here that the main result of the first yajña is the formation of soma which forms the substance to be offeredin the second yajña whichtakesplace in the antariksa. In the first yajña, it is said that the dyuloka is the Agni.Here by dyuloka the *deva-prāṇāgni* that is prevalent in the dyuloka is meant.The *sūryapind* aforms samit (fuel). The smoke coming out of this burning fuel arethe rays of the sun. Because the day is bright during sunshine,here theradiance from the burning fuel constitutes the day. (or day light). Because the

moon makes its appearance only after the sun's radiance is shut down, she is aptly described as the cinder (*angāra)* in this yajña. It is noteworthy here that according to this view, the formation of moon which is also considered as*soma pinda* takes place in this yajña where the Dyuloka and Aditya are involved. The nakṣatras are considered as the *pravargya* of the *aptatva* and inthis way they are considered to have some relation to the *soma pinda* or*appinda* which is moon. Sparks come out of cinder and here the nakṣatras represent the sparks (*visphulinga*). It is implied here that the origin of nakṣatras is related to the moon. It should be noted here that the main difference between Śraddha and Soma is that in the former the *āpyapraṇa* is predominent whereas the latter is a much finer entity, whose main charactsistic is its life-giving and life sustaining property. In other words soma is essentially anna in its finest form.

 The second yajña is described in the following passage,

 **पर्जन्यो वाव गौतम अग्निः।तस्य वायुरेव समित्।अभ्रं धूमः।विद्युदर्चिःअशनिरङ्गाराः। ह्रादनयो विस्फुलिङ्गाः।तस्मिन्नेतस्मिन्नग्नौ देवास्सोमं र नानं जुह्वति। तस्याहुतेर्वर्षं संभवति।²⁵**

** "**OGautama Parjanya is the Agni. To him wind is the fuel. The clouds constitute the smoke. The lightning is his radiance. The thunder is the cinder. The roaring and thundering sounds are the sparks. Inthis Agni the Devas offer the king Soma. From the offering the rains take place.”

 From the following statement in the Saptapatha Brāhmaṇa *viz*

 **‘ओश्रावय’ इति देवाः पुरोवातं ससृजिरे। ‘अस्तु श्रौषट्” इति अभ्रणि समप्लावयत्। 'यज' इत विद्युतम्। 'ये यजामहे' इति स्तनयित्नुम्। वषट्कारेणैव प्रवर्षन् ²⁶**

** “**The Devas produced the easterly winds by uttering *O śrāvaya'*; They brought the clouds by uttering ‘*astu śrousat*' They produced lightning by uttering ‘yaja' and thunder by uttering ‘*ye yajāmake*”. When they said ‘*vouṣat’* the rains fell”.

 it is clear that the Aryans believed that by the co-operative functioning of *purovāta* (easterlies). *abhra* (clouds), *vidyut* (lightning) and *stanayitnu* (thunder, the rainfall takes place. Among these the purovāta, the moist easterlywinds which bring monsoon to their area were considered most importantParjanya that is referred to in the above passage in the Chandogyopanisat actually refers to the rain bearing clouds brought in by the moist easterlies with agni embedded in it. It is pertinent to point out here that in the *Aṣtimurti Śivatatva* one of the names of *Śiva* is ‘*Bhava’*. This *Bhava* is nothing but Parjanya God as explained in Satapatha:

** तमब्रवीत्। भवोसीति। तद्यदस्य तन्नामाकरोत्।पर्जन्यस्तद्रपमभवत्। पर्जन्यो वै भवः। पर्जन्याद्धीदं सर्वं भवति।²⁷**

**^( “)**He (Prajapati) told him. ‘You are *Bhava*. ‘When he gave the name Parjanya, he took that form. Parjanya is Bhava. From Parjanya all these things come into existence.

 Actually the eight forms of Siva constitute the eight forms which Agni takes. Therefore here Parjanya is considered as Agni in which Soma is offered. Since vāyu favours the strengthening of Parjanya it is called *samit* (fuel) The cloud formation on all sides is called *dhūma* (smoke). Since lightning illuminates the whole sky, here this lightning is called *arcih* (radiance). The thunder which is heard after the lightning subsides is here cinder (*angara*). The secondary sounds accompanying the main thunder are called sparks (*visphulingah*). In the language of the rṣis thunder constitutes angāra and garjana and tarjana constitute the *visphulingas*. We shall refer to this again later. The result of this yajna is rainfall.

 The third yajña deals with the rainfall falling on earth (*Parthivāgni*) and producing vegetation. The fourth and fifth deal with man eating the food and producing a child by copulation.

 From what we have seen above it is now possible for us to present a conceptual model of the rainfall process as was known to the Vedic seers.

**THE MODEL**

 1. The rainfall on the earth is a fertilisation process as a result of which vegetation and life comes upon earth.

 2. The heat of the sun lifts the waters from the ocean and the winds carry them northwards.

 3. The moist winds reach the foot of the Himalayas when the sun reaches the extreme northward position.

 4, The west winds are pushed back by the winds which after getting deflected at the foot of the hills arrive as moist easterlies (*purovāta*) bringing monsoon rains to Northwest India. The wind rules the rain'.

 5. A period of about six months elapsesbetween the absorption of water from the oceans in the south and delivery of rainfall in Northwest India.

 6. Eight types of monsoon rainfall can be identified based on winds, rainfall, thunder and lightning. These are named *Jinvarāvṛt*, *Ūgrarāvṛt*, *Bhaumarāvṛt* etc

 7. There is a feed of soma on the atmosphere which helps in making the clouds rain.

 8. When certain fuel material like Karira fruits, varṣahva plants etc.are offered in the fire, they have the properties of soma and the smoke going up aids in squeezing the rains from the clouds.

 The above model was the starting point for the post-Vedic experts, who improved it and used the same for forecasting rainfall. We shall presently go through these details

 Before closing our account of the development of weather science during the Vedic period. it is necessary to highlight those aspects of Indra-Vitra confrontation which have a bearing on the rainfall process. In fact Madhusūdan Ojha had planned a chapter for this topic in the first part of his ‘Parjanya Samikṣa’ Unfortunately the first part of his book is not available to us, We shall therefore deal with this subject in our own way after examining the material available in the original literature.

**INDRA-VṚTRA CONFRONTATION**

 We have seen that the rainfall commences in Northwest India immediately after the sun reaches his extreme northward position. Before that also some clouds form but they do not rain until the moist easterly winds affect the region. According to Motilal Sharma (probably it is Ojha's view also) the clouds which do not rain are called *abhra* and when they develop and give rain they are ‘*megha*'. The Vedic seers naturally connected the retracting sun's rays to the commencement of rains which have been so far prevented by an adverse prāņa called*Namuci* operating in the clouds. Since the prāņa operating in the sun is called Indra, the Vedic seers described the operation of the sun's rays on the clouds for releasing the rains as Indra striking his *Vajrāyudha* on *Namuci* and releasing the rains. 28, 29 Since lightning and thunder occur during the rainfall his *vajra*represents the thunderbolt.

 A few remarks on Indra principle as depicted in the Ṛgveda are not out of place here. Indra is an important God having maximum influence in the *antarikṣa* or atmospheric region. Nearly one fourth of the Ṛgveda is devoted to prayers addressed to him and some of them deal with his functions Śaunaka in his Bṛahaddevata 30 lists three of his important traits viz, 1) taking up rasa (soma essense from above and water vapour from below to produce rains 2) killing of Vṛtra and 3) the complete accomplishment of every kind of mighty deed. In his activites according to Saunaka the aids are Parjanya, Rudra, Vāyu, Bṛhaspati,Bṛahmanaspati etc. Indra is sometimes identified with the sun who with his all

pervading rays causes life on earth. He interacts with Viṣṇu (the principle of feeding soma to Agni) and is responsible for the yajña cycle of the universe. The ṛtus for example which are responsible for the creation of all types of life on earth are the result of interaction between Indra (agni category) and Viṣṇu (soma category). Indra's mighty deeds are brought into play in the atmosphere in which region he successfully overpowers all negative or asura forces which 1) work against yajña cycle 2) which prevent occurrence of rains 3) which always envelop the region in darkness 4) which pollute the waters of region by blocking the free flow or by freezing them into snow ice glacier etc, and thus rendering them unfit for human use and 5) which prevent the operation of divine forces (sun's light and heat) on them. The soma feed from above is taken up by Indra of the atmosphere who exhibits his might in the form of lightning and thunderstorm activity. The soma reaching the atmosphere mixes with the water vapour and Indra aided by Parjanya and purovāta brings rains to the region of settlement of the Aryans. The Vṛtra, Vala, Ahi, Namuci represent *āsura*or nagative forces which we have mentioned above.

 The Indra-Vṛtra confrontation in the hilly regions adjourning the region of the settlement of the Aryans is beautifully described in the 32nd sūkta of the first mandala of Ṛgveda. Elsewhere also we find some references to this confrontation. It is well-known that the hymns of Ṛgveda were composed by different ṛṣis at different periods and some of them were probably composed just when they were moving to the Punjab plains from the hilly regions on the north and northwest. These give clue to the weather disturbances to which they were exposed and probably there were many occasions or periods during which theywere not getting adequate water for domestic and agricultural purposes. The settlements should have been on the banks of the tributaries of Indus river where river-flows get substantial contribution from snow melt throughout the year. thunderstorm activity brought in by the monsoon current pushes back the activity of the westerly systems or western disturbances and during the monsoon seasonthe river flow is copious because of monsoon rainfall in the lower reaches and snow and glacier melt in the upper reaches. During the winter season, the flow in the river dwindles down and if the temperature conditions are not favourable in the snow bound regions of the catchment, the flow in the spring season considerably decreases causing water scarcity. Westerly systems continue to affect the hilly regions till late spring and under their influence, fog, mist and cloudiness envelop the snow bound areas preventing sunshine and therefore snow melt. In the hot season whenever there is a feed of warm air from the south instability conditions are built up leading to the development of thunderstorm activity which continues during the monsoon season also. The sky clears afterwards and there is bright sunshine aiding snow melt. Warm rain falling on snow results in snow melt due to release of latent heat. Thus the river flow increases giving relief

to the settlers. Water also gets released from glacier snouts when temperature conditions are favourable. All these above mentioned positive (divine) and negative (*āsura*) forces affecting the life of the Aryans were described by them as Indra Vṛtra, Ahi, Vala, Namuci etc. In effect Indra represents sunshine, favourable temperature conditions, thunderstorm activity etc., and he fights with and overcomes the āsura forces Vṛtra, Ahi etc., which prevent the availability of water in channels, by creating conditions like absence of favourable winds, unfavourable temperature, absence of enough sunshine etc. in which water is not released from clouds or in which water gets blocked in glaciers ice and snow. We quote below a few rks for illustration. We have given Wilson's translation with our modification.

**1.इन्द्रस्य तु वीर्याणि प्रवोचं यानि चकार प्रथमानि वज्री।  
अहन्नहिमन्यपस्ततर्द प्रवक्षणा अभिनत् पर्वतानाम्॥**

 “I declare the former valorous deed of Indra which the thunderer has achieved; he killed Ahi; he cast the waters down to the earth; he broke a way for the torrents of the mountain.”

 This refers to the thunderstorm activity in the hilly region in which we have rain associated with thunder and lightning. The word 'ahi' really means a serpent and denotes here the long and sometimes zigzag tracks of glacier, ice and snow on the hill slopes. Melt water reaches the lower level whenever there is sunlight resulting in temperature rise. Also warm rain falling on the slopes results in the release of latent heat and sometimes throws the glacier and ice blocks into disarray.

**2.अहन्नहिं पर्वते शिश्रियाणं त्वष्टास्मै वज्रं स्वयं ततक्ष।  
वाश्रा इव धेनवस्स्यन्दमाना अञ्जः समुद्रमय जग्मुरापः॥**

 “He killed *Ahi* seeking refuge on the mountain. Tvaşta sharpend his far whirling bolt. The flowing waters quickly hastened to the ocean, like cows (hestening) to their calves”

 Here *Tvaṣta* principle is what gives the right shape and dimensions to the created objects.

**3.वृषायमाणोऽवृणीत सोमं त्रिकद्रुकेष्वपिवत् सुतस्य।  
आ सायकं मघवादत्त वज्रमहन्त्रेनं प्रथमजामहीनाम्॥**

 “Behaving like a bull, Indra sought soma and drank the soma prepared in the *trikadruka* sacrifice. Indra took the thunderbolt and killed the first born of the A his”

 Here the soma feed of the atmosphere which results in lightning is symbolically represented as Indra drinking soma. The *trika-druka yaga* which has three components

(jyotis, go, āyus) is nothing but the demonstration of the maintenance of the yajña cycle of the *virāt* (universe). It will be interesting to examine what is meant by the first born of the Ahis. The Aryans were familiar with various form of existence of water at low temperature, like fog, mist, dew, snow, which finally becomes fern, ice and glacier. In post-Vedic Sanskrit literature we have words like *dhūmikā* or *kujhaṭi* (thick fog) *avasyāya* (dow), *tuṣāra* (frost), *hima* (snow) etc. It is very probable that by the first born of Ahis, low cloud or thick fog is meant.

**4.यदिन्द्राहन् प्रथमजामहीनामान्मायिनामभिमानः प्रोत मायाः।  
आत्सूर्यं जनयन् द्यामुषासं तादीत्ना शत्रुं न किला विवित्से ॥**

 “In as much, Indra, as thou hast divided the first born of the Ahis, thou hast destroyed the delusions of the deluders, and then engendering the sun, the dawn, the firmament, thou hast not left an enemy (to oppose thee)"

 In the light of the comments on rk 3, the meaning here is fairly clear.

**5.अहन् वृत्रं वृत्रतरं व्यंसमिन्द्रो वजेण महता वधेन।  
स्कन्धांसीव कुलिशेनाविवृक्णादिः शयत उपवृक् पृथिव्याः॥**

 “With his vast destroying thunderbolt Indra struck the overpowering but mutilaed Vṛtra. As the trunks of trees are felled by the axe, so lies Ahi prostrate on earth”

Severe thunderstorm activity sometimes disturbs the huge snow pilings which come down in huge blocks of ice. Widespread avalanche activity also takes place whenever there is sudden warming of the upper air. In such cases complete disarray of the snow and ice pack on mountain tops and slopes results in huge chunks of ice and snow coming down, sometimes accompanied by land slides also. This is what is described here. Sometimes these huge blocks cause land sides on the steep banks of the channels which completely get blocked as a result and sometimes their courses get altered. Because of the transport of ice and snow to lower levels, melting increases though the heaping effect restricts the area of exposure to sunlight and tends to decrease the rate of melting.

**6.अपादहस्तो अपृतन्यदिन्द्रमास्य वज्रमधि सानौ जघान।  
वृष्णो वध्रिः प्रतिमानं बुभूषन् पुरुत्रा वृत्रो अशयद्यस्तः॥**

“Having neither hand nor foot he defied Indra who struck him with the thunderbolt upon his mouutainlike shoulder, like one emasculated trying to pose, as virilo, person, then Vṛta, mutilated very badly, slept.”

Here the shattered blocks of ice and snow lying on the bottom of the slope of mountains are referred to. It can also mean the multishaped cloud patches which are seen close to the mountains after the thunderstorm activity is over,

**7.नदं न भिन्नममुया शयानं मनो रुहाणा अतियन्त्यापः।  
यश्चिद्वृत्रो महिना पर्यतिष्ठत् तासामहिः पत्सुतश्शीर्बभूव॥**

 “The waters that delight the minds (of men) flow over him recumbent on this earth; as a river (bursts through) its broken (banks), Ahi has been prostrated beneath the feet of the waters, which Vṛtra by his might, had obstructed.”

 The melt water flowing in the channel completely submerging the ice blocks which are sometimes partially buried in land slides is described here. distinction is made here between Vitra and Ahi. We shall comment on this when we see the next rk.

**8.दासपत्नीरहिगोपा अतिष्ठन् निरुद्धा आपः पणिनेव गावः।  
अर्पा बिलमपिहितं यदासीद् वृत्रं जघन्य अप तदूवार॥**

 “Just like the cows blocked by Pani, the waters stood obstructed when they were guarded by Ahi and were under the control; of Dasa (Vrtra) as though they were his wives, But by slaying Vrtra, Indra set open the cave that had confined them.”

 Here we get some clue to understand the terms Ahi and Vṛtra. Ahi represents an ice block or big snow chunk or even a glacier. Vitra represents a condition in which water is not allowed to flow out of the pieces. This distinction though holds good in some rks, is not strictly adhered to by the si When temperature conditions are favourable water makes its way through them and comes out at one end through the snout while the other end remains buried under the moraine. During the thunderstorm activity the water flow from the snout is accelerated.

 All the above rks occur in the 32nd sūkta of the first mandala 32 There are many other rks occurring elsewhere¹³ which generally deal with the same type of activity of Indra. We give below a few examples. (only translations (Wilson's) are given).

 1. Thou hast opened the receptale of the waters; thou hast detained in the mountain, the treasure of malignant; when thou hast slain Vrtra the destroyer, thou madest the sun visible in the sky.

 2. When Indra who delights in the sacrificial food, had slain the streamobstructing Vṛtra and was pouring down the waters, he stood firm, amid the torrents like a mountain and, endowed with a thousand means of protecting his (votaries) increased in vigour.

 3. The strong heaven was rent asunder with fear at the clamour of the Ahi, when thou Indra wast inspirited by (drinking) the effused (soma juice) and thy thunderbolt in its vigour struck off the head of Vitra, the obstructor of heaven and earth.

 4. The darkness obstructed the current of the waters; the waters were concealed in the joints of Vṛtra's belly. Indra made them flow down to the earth.

 5. Thou thunderer has shattered with thy bolt the broad massive mountain at the various joints and has sent down the waters that were confined in it to flow (at will); verily thou alone possessest all power.

 It should be mentioned here that Hillebrandt, 34 Paramasiva Iyer³⁵ and some others had suspected that some of the rks of above type may refer to glacier phenomena.

**DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE POST-VEDIC PERIOD**

 Having seen the contributions of the Vedic seers to weather science, we now pass on to the post-Vedic period or to the Tantrika part of weather science as Madhusudan Ojha puts it, which forms the subject matter discussed in the second part of Parjanya Samikṣā, which Ojha has named as Kādambini. During a period of about thousand years between 500 B C. and 500 A.D, a numbe of authors of Smṛtis which deal with Dharmaśāstra also wrote treatises covering a wide range of subjects. These were practically encyclopaedia of those days and information on a variety of subjects could be had in them. Meteorology was dealt with by Nārada, Kāsyapa, Garga, Parāśara, Vasiṣṭha, Drubiņa, Bṛhaspatr Devala, Vajra. Sahadeva, Ṛṣiputra, etc, in their treatises. Varahamihira who wrote his well known Brahatsamhita around 500 A. D. dealt with meterology in a few chapters of his work and mentioned that he had referred to many earlier works on the subject before writing these chapters. Another interesting work dealing with agricultural meteorology is Kṛṣi Parāśara believed to have been compiled in the present form from some original work, during the 10th century A. D Panini's Aṣtādhyāyi (500 B. C) was perhaps one of the earliest post-Vedic works giving information on rainfall measurements and droughts. Kautilya's Arthasestra (4th century B.C.) gives some information on rainfall distribution in the country as well as modes of measurement of rainfall. However detailed information on the development of concepts and their use in forecasting rainfall is available only in the treatises mentioned earlier.

 The Purāṇas which are meant to be elaborations of the truths enshrined in the Vedas also deal with meteorology here and there in a brief way. Many descriptions are available in them, dealing with the origin of rainfall and its different types as well as different types of clouds. These help us to some extent in understanding the nature of development of the subject during the post-Vedio period.

 The concepts of rainfall which the Vedic seers had recorded in their compositions formed the starting point for the post-Vedic scholars to work upon Elaborations were effected on the *garbha* concept of the Vedic seers according to which the rays of the sun hold the waters of the oceans for about six months after which they come down as rain when the sun attains his maximum northward position. 36 Further elaborations of the role of soma in rainfall was also made by the post-Vedio scholars by bringing in the moon and assigning to it a very vital role. The important role played by the sun was fully endorsed by them and many details of rainfall occurrence as related to the position of the sun with respect to the stars were worked out and utilised for developing forecasting techniques.

 The Matsya Purāņa, *37* Vāyu Purāņa, 38 and Vişņu Purāņa 39 deal with the role of the sun in the rainfall phenomenon. According to them the sun's rays absorb the waters of the oceans rivers and of living beings both animate and inanimate and at the appropriate time of the year characterised by the season or sun's position, the waters get transferred to the clouds which under the influence of favourable winds pour rain on earth for six months accompanied by thunder and lightning. The Vayu Purāņa makes special mention of the rainfall cycle by which the same water goes up and comes down as rain. The Visņu Puriņa describes the garbha as lasting for eight months Since the rainfall period in North India lasts for about four months the above period for garbha is assumed by the author of this work.

 The Samhita writers were actually more concerned about the symptoms of garbha of the atmosphere, its nourishment and finally its delivery as raiufail after a specific period, which they assumed as 195 days from the date of formation of rain foetuses in the atmosphere. The logic behind this figure 195 will be clear as we proceed. In the Samhitas we do not get a clear explanation of the garbha process as such If we go by what the Purāņas say, the water from the oceans are lifted up by the rays of the sun and goes to enrich the soma content (i. e, water vapour) of the atmosphere. This soma stays in the clouds which under the influence of winds pour the waters down on earth as rain. Since rainfall occurs only for a restricted period during the same part of the year every time. it was convenient for the post-Vedic scholars to imagine that the rainfall is a process of three stages *viz*, 1, fertilisation (garbhādhāna) 2. the growth of the

rain foetuses (*garbhadohada or garbhapoṣaṇa*) and 3. delivery as rainfall (*prasava or prasūti*). Again taking the hints from the Puraņas, *garbhādhāna* would simply mean the transport of water by sun's heat to the atmosphere, *garbhadohada* means the enrichment of the water vapour in the atmosphere and its movement here and there under the influence of winds and *prasava* means the fall of rain from the clouds which form when the *garbha* has gone through the period of its full growth.

 The next thing that engaged the post-Vedic scholars was to find some symptoms by which they could confirm that the fertilisation of the atmosphere had taken place. Since the Vedic seers had already postulated six months as the period of pregnancy of the atmosphere, the only way left to them was back from the actual time of peak rainfall activity by six months and see whether they could get some clues from the conditions of the atmosphere at that time to confirm fertilisation. Since peak monsoon period in Northwest India is the middle of July, the time of fertilisation of the atmosphere should be around middle of January which coincides well with the peak western disturbance activity in the same region. It is quite natural that the characteristics of western disturbance activity viz., light rain, cloudiness, chilly winds, lightning, thunder, snow- fall at high level stations etc, suited them well to confirm the fertilisation in the atmosphere This is exactly what they did. They defined five symptoms viz., 1) wind, 2) light rain. 3) lightning. 4) thunder and 5) cloudy sky to confirm fertilisation of the atmosphere. In other words they went on putting the normal weather patterns into their model and called it by different names Του much rain after the conception had taken place was considered to be harmful to the conceived foetus and they imagined that it is an abortive process resulting in poor rainfall at the time of delivery. The following verse in Bṛhatsamhita expresses the above concepts.

**पवनसलिलविद्यत् गर्जिताभ्रान्वितो यः स भवति बहुतोयः पञ्चरूपाभ्युपेतः।  
विसृजति यदि तोयं गर्भकालेऽतिभूरि प्रसवसमयमित्वा शीकाराम्भः करोति ॥**

 "Foetus which is characterised by the five components viz, wind, rain, lightning, thunder and clouds yields plenty of rain. One which at the time of formation loses too much water produces only a drizzle at the time of delivery"

 When once *garbhādhāna* has taken place, certain criteria were fixed for ensuring the nourishment of the rain embryos. The following symptoms appearing in different months were believed to nourish the rain embryos.

 1. Mild fall of temperatue in *Mārgasirṣa*.

 2. Snow fall in *Pauṣa* but not too heavy fall.

 3. Red glow of the horizon in the morning and evening and appearance of clouds with halo in *Märgasira* and *Paușa*.

 4. Strong wind, foggy conditions obstructing the visibility of the sun and the moon especially in the mornings and evenings and cold weather in the month of *Māgha.*

* *5. Strong wind, appearance of clouds, halo round the sun and moon and copper colour of sun's disc in the month of *Phalguna.*

* *6. Overcast skies, rain, halo round the sun and wind in the month of *Caitra.*

* *7. Cloudy condition with wind, thunder, lightning and rain in the month of *Vaiśākha.*

 While the above factors augur good rainfall in the rainy months, post-Vedic scholars defined certain symptoms for the miscarriage of the rain embryos, like fall of meteors, too much lightning, dust storm, earthquakes, certain imaginary shapes of clouds and cloud colours, believed to be inauspicious. Normally symptoms contrary to those which are said to nourish the rain embryos result in poor rainfall in the rainy season.

 To explain the occurrence of hail storms with large hail stones, it believed by them that when the delivery of rainfall does not take place on maturity of the embryos, hail stones fall at a later date due to over-stayal of water in the clouds.

 A close examination of the above criteria will reveal that the post-Vedic scholars made an intensive study of the normal weather patterns in various months and compared the conditions in various months preceding monsoon season, for good and bad monsoon years. In other words all they did was to observe carefully the weather elements in each month and identify certain features which in their opinion were favourable for good monsoon and certain other features which gave poor monsoon rainfall.

**THE ROLE OF SOMA**

 No other entity has caused more confusion in the development of weather has done. Even during the Science in the post-Vedic period, than what soma Vedic period, the conception of its three-fold existence did lead to confusion and vitiated the thinking of the Vedic seers. To give one example, let us see the meaning of the following ṛk.

**पूर्वापरं चरतो माययैतौ शिशू क्रीलन्तौ परियातो अध्वरम्।  
विश्वान्यन्यो भुवनाभिचष्ट ऋतूरन्यो विदधज्जायते पुनः ॥**

"The two children (the sun and the moon) while playing move from east to west in the sky as though by a mysterious force to perform their yajña. One (the sun) sees (illuminates) all the objects in the world while the other (the moon) causes the ṛtus (seasons) and is born again and again (waxes and wanes)."

 It is very difficult to understand how the moon causes the rtus. Even Madhusudan Ojha in his Ahorātravāda 43 while commenting on this ṛk says

 **“यद्यपि सूर्यस्य ऋतुजनकत्वं लोकाः मन्यन्ते तथापि सूर्यस्यैकरूप्यादौ विशेषादृतुजनकत्वं नास्ति। चन्द्रमसस्तु ह्रासवृद्ध्यादिविशेषशालीखसंयोगवियोगाभ्यां सूर्याग्नौ तारतम्येनातिरेकं सृजतीति तस्यैव ऋतुजनकत्वं वेद्यम्।”**

 In other words he justifies the statement that moon causes the Įtus.How-ever he writes immediately after that

** "ऋतेऽग्निभागाः ऋतवः षडेते भवन्ति सोमान्वयतारतम्यात्।”**

 That is, the rtus are caused because of the imbalance betweensoma and agni.

 Actually it is the soma concept of the moon that is to be considered here and not the moon herself We have already seen how the interaction of soma located in the north and moving southwards and agni located in the south and as their relative strengths vary moving northwards produces the various seasons moon which was during the year. As time passed on, the importance of the conceived as soma pinda increased and it is unfortunate that the real nature and role of soma was understood less and less. This has been one of the reasons for the gradual decline in scientific thinking on the part of the post-Vedio scholars while dealing with the rainfall process. Taking the clue from the Vedic seers that soma is a fertilising agent (सोमो वै रेतोधाः) the post-Vedic scholars imagined that certain favourable positions of the moon with respect to the stars are conducive to garbhādhāna and tried to identify these positions. on the other hand being of the Agni category was imagined to favour delivery of rainfall. Presumably, because of the relative position of the sun, they believed that the waxing moon has greater influence on conception than the waning moon and the waning moon has greater influence (indirectly) on delivery than the waxing moon. This concept automatically led them to believe that there will be a difference in pakṣa (fortnight) between periods of conception and delivery. That is if conception takes place in the bright half of the mouth delivery will take place in the dark half. Further since they were aware of the apparent motion of the stars with respect to the sun, they imagined that the region in the sky where fertilisation took place gets an apparent shift of 180° with respect to the sun

during a period of six months and therefore the foetuses conceived in the dawn bring rain in the evening and vice versa. Though these ideas look very odd, they had one advantage that observations can be confined to a local region and any technique to forecast rainfall, can be based on local observations on conditions conducive to conception growth and delivery of rainfall. With all these manipulations the post-Vedic scholars assumed a figure of 180+15=195 days for the period that elapses between conception and delivery. This is what is stated by Varahamihira in his Bṛhatsamhita

** यन्नक्षत्रमुपगते गर्भश्चन्द्रे भवेत् स चन्द्रवशात्। पञ्चनवते दिनशते तत्रैव प्रसवम याति॥**

 “The foetuses formed during the stay of the moon in a particular asterism will be delivered after 195 days when the moon is back in the same asterism (after seven rounds)”

 (N.B:—After 192 days the moon comes back to the same star after completing seven rounds).

 Having fixed the period of conception and knowing the rainy months by observation, it was easy for the post-Vedic scholars to work out the normal time of conception which should spread over a certain period since the rainy period was known to last for three, or four months. Moon's role on conception led them to use its position with respect to the sun and the stars togetherwith some more sky symptoms to fix the dates of conception. Thus different dates of conception were worked out for different dates (or short period) of occurrence of rainfall. For example the following table extracted from the statements in Bṛhatsamhita gives the periods of conception for various periods of delivery. Lunar months ending with new moon (*amāntamāsa*) are used here.

|                         |                             |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Conception              | Delivery                    |
| Pausa kṛṣṇa (dark half) | Srāvaṇa śukla (bright half) |
| Magha śukla             | Srāvana kṛṣṇa               |
| Magha kṛṣṇa             | Bhadrapada śukla            |
| Phalguna śukla          | Bhadrapada kṛṣṇa            |
| Phalguna kṛṣṇa          | Āsvayuja śukla              |
| Caitra śukla            | Āśvayuja kṛṣṇa              |
| Caitra kṛṣṇa            | Kārtika śukla               |

 The Vedic seers used the position of the sun for fixing the time of commencement of rains. On the other hand, the post-Vedic scholars used the lunar months for fixing the same. They did not realise that this basic departure would mean difficulties which the future generations will face because the precession effect causes the seasons to slide back with respect to the stars at the rate of

about one day every seventy two years. At the time of composition of Bṛhatsamhita, the rainy season as revealed in the statements given above commenced in *Śrāvaņa* whereas we know that at present in northwest India the rainy season commences in *Āṣādha* and comes to an end in *Āsvayuja.* Naturally there was difference of opinion among scholars (apparently belonging to different periods) in fixing the time of commencement of the conception season. It was held by some that the clouds begin to conceive after the bright half of the month of *Kārtika.* Utpala the commentator of Bṛhatsamhita quotes verses from Siddhasena to this effect. But this was not the majority view ‘न च तम्मत बहूनाम्’. According to Garga Vasistha, Paragara. Ṛsiputra, and Kasyapa 47 marks of pregnancy of clouds could be detected from the first day of the bright half of *Märgaśirsa* onwards when the moon enters *Pūrvāṣādhā*

 There is a possibility of another reason for this divergence of opinion on the date of conception. There is every likelihood that during the post-Vedic period the area of settlement of Aryans was expanding both eastwards, and southwards, Since monsoon rains will commence earlier in these areas, the dates of conception also will have to be assumed earlier than that in the Punjab areas. It is therefore natural that scholars belonging to different areas differ regarding time of commence ment of the conception period.

**THE MODEL**

 To summarise, the conceptual model of the rainfall process as formulated by the post-Vedic scholars may be briefly stated as follows:

 1. The rainfall is essentially a yajña process characterised by three stages, *viz.*, conception or formation of rain embryos, their growth and delivery as rainfall on earth. The period between conception and delivery is 195 days.

 2. The formation of the rain embryos takes place during the period when western disturbances affect northwest India and is identified with the help of five symptoms (lakṣaṇas) *viz,* wind, rain, cloud, thunder and lightning.

 3. Events during the growth period affect the quantum of rainfall at the time of delivery. Certain defined meteorological conditions during the growth period ensure good rainfall at the time of delivery.

 4. Hail storms occur if the rainfall does not take place at the normal time and the rain foetuses overstay in the atmosphere.

 5. The moon's position with respect to the sun and the stars influences the formation of rain foetuses. The moon is conceived as a replica of the soma in the heavens and soma is capable of fertilising the atmosphere.

 Based on the above concepts and extensive. observations the post-Vedic scholars developed several techniques of forcasting rainfall in the long range. If at all there had been success for them, it was certainly due to their capacity to observe the day to day weather and the individual weather elements like clouds temparature, condition of sky, winds, rain, thunder and lightning etc. They were extremely clever in working mentally correlations based on collected data. shall see these details presently.

**TECHNIQUES OF FORECASTING RAINFALL IN THE  
LONG RANGE**

 The Vedic seers were well aware of the year to year variations of weather occurrences as well as extremes of weather like floods and droughts. They were therefore compelled to study the causes of these variations. After collecting careful observations of the day to day weather over a prolonged period, their natural tendency was to correlate certain weather disturbances during the, garbha periods, (periods of formation and growth of rain foetuses) with the quantity of rainfall, its intensity and time of occurrence during the rainy or monsoon season, These constituted the first steps in the formulation of rules of forecasting rainfall on the long range in the post-Vedic period. Careful observations of the conditions of sky, wind, temperature, halos round the sun and the moon and even behaviour of animals, birds etc, as well as plants and trees some hours or even one or more days prior to the occurrence of heavy or moderate rainfall in a place also enabled them to formulate rules for forecasting rainfall on short and meduim range which we shall see later.

 Before we go further into the formulation of the forecasting rules, it will be useful to put down some basic principles of astronomy as known to our ancients.

 1. The sun slides back with respect to the stars and completes one round in a year. (The annual motion of the earth round the sun was most probably not known to our ancients clearly.)

 2. The sun moves through the 27 asterisms of the Indian system during the above period and stays in each for a period of little over 13 days.

 3. The moon stays in each asterism for one day and completes one round of the heavens in 27.3 days.

 4. The moon's stay-period in each asterism is not uniform. Sometimes it is less than a day and sometimes it is more.

 5. The apparent north south motion of the moon during a lunar month is as much as the north south motion of the sun during a year. The annual path of the sun in the celestial sphere is more or less followed by the moon also with a deviation of 5 degrees north or south.

 6. The aparent path of the moon in the sky is zig-zag. (the concept of *Rāsakridā* of Lord Kṛṣṇa has its origin here.)

 7. In the winter period Kartika to Magha the moon moves from south to north in Śukla paksa and north to south in Kṛṣṇa paksa (The months refer to lunar months (*Amānta*)

 8. In the summer months of Caitra to Asadha the moonmoves from north to south in Sukla pakṣa and south to north in the Kṛṣṇa pakṣa Phalguna and Bhadrapadă are transition months.

 9. The asterisms according to our ancients are distributed in tne zodiac in a belt of 48° with a spread of 24° on either side of the celestial equator. The planets' also move within this belt. Initailly they had 28 asterisms. Later, Abhijit which was assumed to be located partly in Uttarāṣādhš and partly in Sravana, was dropped leaving 27 asterisms covering the zodiac. order to identify the nakṣatras our ancients first developed the idea of groups of stars having shapes of animals, birds, men eto, In each group they identified one bright star which was called *yogatārā*. The asterisms Asvini,  
Bharani etc., were located with the help of these *yogatārās* which were referred to by the same names. In order to facilitate the location of these stars the astronomers then developed the idea of separate paths in the celestial sphere in which these stars are distributed. They imagined three broad named celestial equator and these were *Irāvata*, belts parallel to the *Jaradgava* and *Vaiśvānara*. *Vaiśvānara* is in the southern side of the equator Iravata on the nothern side and *Jaradgava* in the middle. Each of these three broad beits, was further subdivided into three secondary belts (*vithis*) so that there were a total of nine *vithis*, three on the nothern side, three on the southern side and three in the middle. These nine withis from north to south have the following names:

* 1) Nāga 2) Gaja 3) Iravata* on the northern side; *4) Vṛsa5) Go 6) Jaradgava* in the middle; *7) Mrga 8) Aja 9) Vaisvānara*on the southern side.

 It is interesting to note that for a man located outside these belts in the northern hemisphere, the span of these belts above the horizon would appear smaller and smaller as one proceeds southwards and the names of the beltsare quite suggestive of this diminution. In fact seven horses which the sun rides on, are nothing but the seven tracks of the sun, three side, three on the northern side and one in the middle (along the celestial equator.They are incorporated in the Vedas as seven metres (Chandas) Gayatri (24 syllables) being assciated with the southernmost track and Jagatı (48 syllables) being associated with northernmost track, Bṛhati (36 syllables)

is the track along the celestial equator The movement of the moon across the sky is not only associated with one yogatarā every day but also with each of these belts. In other words, the naksatras are distributed in the nine *vithis*, three in each. If we see these nakṣatras in the sky and follow them in succession i. e., in the order Asvini, Bharani etc., we get a pattern resembling a moving serpent with them It is for this reason the colleotion of these stars is sometimes called *Nākṣatrika Sarpa*'. We may also say that the moon moves through them like a serpent.

 10. The tithis (denoting moon's phase) have some relation to the nakṣatras in the sense, tithis and nakṣatras have a tendency to coincide on certain days in certain lunar months of the year always. For example Citrā nakşatra i. e., moon in Citrā and Purnima coincide many times in the month of Caitra. Vaisākha (i.e,moon in Visākhā) and Pūrñimā coincide many times in the month of Vaisākha and so on. Similarly other tithis also have coinciding nakṣatras always. Some examples are given below.

[TABLE]

 These coincidences were given great importance in the formulation of rules for forecasting rainfall in the long range.

 With the above information we shall now revert back to our subject. We have already seen the importance of soma for rainfall as understood by the Vedio seers and endorsed by the post-Vedic scholars. Soma is the fertilising agent which mixes with water and comes down as rain. The post-Vedio scholars used this idea to formulate their improved model of rainfall process. During the western disturbances period, it was conceived that the formation of rain foetuses takes place as a result of injection of soma from the north-a process of fertilisation (सोमो वै रेतोवाः) that is why during this period a soft wind from the north is considered as a favourable symptom. The northern region is the abode of soma (snow) and the south the seat of agni, so that the southward movement of soma and the northward movement of agni are essential for the functioning of the cycle of ṛtus or seasons which are caused by the interaction of soma and agni. To put in a more direct way the western disturbance activity pushing agni (sun) to the south, and the northward movement of the sun pushing soma (snow) to

the north are essential for the occurrence of monsoon rains. This will automatically mean existence of soma in the north or its restoration to the northern region by some process and the existence of agni in the south or its restoration to the south are most conducive for the orderly functioning of the seasons and more particularly the rainfall cycle. Keeping in mind the above ideas the post- Vedic scholars believed that whenever the moon moves in a northerly track or is restored to a northerly track, conditions are favourable for the formation of healthy rain foetuses and whenever she moves in a southerly track with sun (agni) on her northern side, or whenever a condition of soma being overpowered by agni is created, it favours abortion of rain foetuses if the foetuses are not fully developed and a healthy delivery of rainfall if the foetuses have gone through their full period of growth. With this basic hypothesis they made careful observations of sky and weather conditions as well as the position of the sun and moon with respect to the stars and related the nature and distribution of rainfall during the delivery period to certain favourable and unfavourable sky conditions and corresponding position of sun and moon during the periods of formation and growth. When once a start is made in this direction, the natural tendency will be to go into elaborations and bring in the influence of nakṣatras and planets on rainfall process after attributing the quality of soma or agni or realted qualities to them especially when they have been taught by the Vedic seers that agni are the two basic things which have given rise to everything that we witness in this univer.e. Thus a new talent was developed for which the Vedic seers had shown the way. Though initially this art of rainfall forecasting was confined to a few experts like. Garga, Parāśara Nārada, Devala, Bhṛgu, Kāśyapa etc, later in the light of careful observations covering more regions, the number of experts increased and naturally the thumb rules for forecasting rainfall in oreased in number. Many of these have been handed down the generations and have been incorporated even in local proverbs and sayings. Madhusūdan Ojha has taken great pains to collect from various sources all these thumb rules for long range forecasting and has beautifully arranged them monthwise in his work Kādambinī. As we have seen already these rules were by no means adhoc but based on some concepts which our ancients developed in their own way after some effort. he Vedio as well as post- Vedic scholars were earnest seekers of truth and in their quest for understanding Nature they always proceeded from the known to the unknown. Their principal aim was always to detect the presence of a grand unity and harmony in the manifestation of Nature and this led to look for similarities in *ādhidaivika, ādhibhautika* and *ādhyātmika* spheres. and soma

 It is important to note here that according to the Vedic seers conception takes place during the winter period when the snow accumulation incrases. To be in harmony with this they believed that the moon plays a favourable role in the formation of rain foetuses when she is in the waxing stage. During the summer months when the snow accumulation gets depleted the moon's waning

stage happens to coincide with the delivery of rainfall or abortion if the rain foetuses are not fully developed. The obsrvations that rainfall takes place during certain months of the year only and during this period the sun passes through the same stars every year (neglecting precession effects, of course) led the post-Vedic scholars to involve the stars without difficulty in the rainfall process. The following rule clearly illustrates our point.

 **पौषे मूलाद्भरण्यन्तं चन्द्रचारेण गर्भति। आर्द्रादिमे विशाखान्ते सूर्यचारेण वर्षति॥**

 "In the month of Pausa conception takes place when the moon moves through Mula to Bharaņi and rainfall takes place when the sun moves through Ārdra to Viśakha.”

 (N.B:–Invariably the moon passes through the asterism Mula on the new moon day in the month of Pausa. The sun passes through Ārdra in the month of Āṣādha)

 Thus a whole series of long range forecasting rules can be developed bas on the relative position of the moon with respect to the sun and the stars. The role of planets in rainfall is more unnaturally forced after categorising them under *1) Saumya 2) āgneya 3) Vāyavya* planets and corresponding rules developed.

 At this stage some general remarks on Indian weather may be of help to the reader for a correct appreciation of the implications of these thumb rules for forcasting rainfall in the long range. The Vedic seers as well as post-Vedic scholars should have been well aware of the striking diffierence in the nature and rainfall potential of the western disturbances and the monsoon. Especially the bang characterised by dark clouds, lightning, thunder, wind and torrential rain which ushers in the monsoon over northwest India sustaining all forms of life and its prolonged presence with breaks was compared by them with the fleeting type of western disturbance activity with occasional light rain from thinly overcast sky, occasional lightning, thunder mist, fog and winds which are sometimes pleasant when they are from north or northeast behind a moving disturbance on a clear sunny day and then the concepts of formation of rain foetuses, their growth and western disturbance activity was delivery were developed. Naturally when once considered as the beginning of the rainfall cycle its nature and features should be indicative of nature and features of the end product viz., the monsoon rainfall.

 By carefully observing the weather and sky conditions day after day for a prolonged period, it should have been easy for the post-Vedic scholars to recognise the following features of the weather patterns during the various months.

 The monsoon completely withdraws from northwest India in the beginning of the month of Kartika (October-November). The days are characterised by clear skies in the region and temperatures show a falling trend especially in the nights.

 In the month of Margasira (November-December) the western disturbance activity slowly picks up and we get one or two disturbances which normally are mild to moderate. The anticyclone at the lower levels over Northwest Pakistan and adjoining Iran begins to build up. Because of the prolonged absence of rain, haze in the sky increases. The temperatures have not yet fallen appreciably.

 In the month of Paușa (December-January) frequency of western disturbance increases and temperatures fall sharply. The plains sometimes get appreciable rain and behind the disturbances the sky clears and the haze decreases.

 In the month of Magha (January-February) the western disturbance ¨activity reaches a peak sometimes giving rise to thick fog or frost, especially whenever the skies clear in the night after the passage of western disturbance. The foggy conditions during the day keeps the maximum of the day temperetures the lowest of the year.

 In the month of Phālguna (February-March) westerlies assert themselves in the region. Haze which cleared during peak western disturbance activity again increaces.

 In the month of Caitra (March-April ) westerlies continue, temperatures slowly build up and the first thunderstorms occur and decrease the haze.

 In the month of Vaisākha (April-May) the temperatures increase, skies are clear except when there are thunderstorms which gain strength as summer advances.

 One of the interesting observations of our ancients was that too much rain during the period of initial growth of the rain foetuses results in poor rainfall at the time of delivery. They imagined that rain foetuses are destroyed (*garbhasrāva* if there is too much rain during the time of their early growth period. It was till very recently believed that too much western disturbance activity affects the monsoon rainfall of the subsequent season. In fact, the very first forecast of monsoon rainfall issued by Blanford, the first chief of the India Meteorological Department after the successive famines of 1876 and 1877 was based on the negative correlation between winter snowfall and subsequent monsoon rainfall and it proved to be correct at that time though we know now that it is very very rare that the monsoon will fail successively for three seasons.

 It was also believed by our ancients that hotter the conditions are in the month of Vaisakha and Jyaistha (May-June). the better will be the performanee of the monsoon. This was also the view of the meteorologists in the early stages of development of forecasting techniques.

 Having seen the logic behind the evolution of forecasting rules for the long range, the next question is when these rules are developed on the basis of past

observations and also on the assumption of moon's influence, how far will they be successful in actual practice. No elaborate reasoning is required to infer that quite a number of these forecasts may not come true. In fact our ancients were clever enough to introduce many saving clauses to explain away the failures. Recent attempts to find out the influence of the moon on rainfall has not proved anything definite. In any case, it is obvious that the forecasting rules for long range based on the moon's influence as formulated by our ancients will not stand any rigourous test for their validity.

 However, it should be said in fairness to our ancients, that their knowledge of the characteristics of rainfall of their region was very sound and they had very carefully observed the weather and climatic pattern throughout the year. With this detailed knowledge they could correlate rains of the monsoon with the events of the winter season and in quite a few cases they should have been successful. Too much rain during the month of Caitra was considered to spoil a good monsoon High temperature during the premonsoon period was imagined to be a good sign for the monsoon rains. These were extremely useful thumb rules for forecasting monsoon rainfall and were practiced by modern meterologists during the early stages of development of Indian meteorology. The climatic pattern of the weather during the growth period. Phalgun Jyaiṣṭha was well known to them and any departure from it was considered to affect the normal performance of the monsoon Considering the fact that long range forecasting of monsoon performance is still in its infancy stage, it can be safely concluded that our ancients had done remarkably well in developing the rules for the same.

 However, there was also the dark side of the picture. Some of the experts were overenthusiastic and based their forecasts on the observations of one day. For example they divided a chosen day like Akşaya Tṛtiyä day into four parts. The weather in each of these parts was supposed to forecast the performance of the monsoon in each month of the on-coming four month period.

 The following example extracted from Kādambini serves as illustrations

 1. Divide *Māgha pūrnimā* day into four equal parts and assign each month of the rainy season to each one of the parts. If there are clouds or rain in one of these I arts there will be no rain in the corresponding month of the rainy season.

 2. Consider the ten days commencing from the first day of the bright half of *Caitra*. Divide this period into four parts of two and a half days each and assign each part to each of the four months of the rainy season. If there is rain in any one of these two and a half days period it is to be inferred that there will be no rain in the corresponding month of the rainy season.

 3. Consider the last eight hours of *Akşaya Tṛtiya* day. Divide it into arts of two hours each and assign each of them to each of the four months

of the rainy season. If there is wind from the east in the first, wind from the north in the second, wind from the west in the third and wind from the south in the last two hour periods there will be good rain in *Asādha, Srāvaṇa, Bhādra- pada* and *Āsvina* months of subsequent season.

 The above examples are quite suggestive of the overenthusiasm on the part of some of the post-Vedic scholars, who in course of time completely lost rationalism and logic in the formulation of thumb rules. These were the people who introduced pure astrology in weather science and put an end to all further development.

 To summarise we would like to offer the following views on the long range forecasting rules of our ancients :

 1) Considering the development of the subject all over the world at that time our ancients had done remarkably well in developing the techniques of forecasting rainfall.

 2) Their capacity to observe details had been remarkable.

 3) In the beginning the subject started in a logical manner, but later it fell into the hands of a few less competent people, who blocked further development by giving wrong orientation to the subject.

**TECHNIQUES OF FORECASTING RAINFALL IN THE  
SHORT AND MEDIUM RANGE**

 The post-Vedio scholars were very keen observers of Nature. When they wanted to frame thumb rules for short and medium range (i.e., for periods ranging from a few hours to four or five days), they were on surer grounds, because they knew that the conditions on earth and in the atmosphere just prior to the occurrence of rainfall were far more important than the position of the moon or the sun with respect to the stars in the sky. They made therefore careful observations of the various elements prior to the occurrence of rainfall and came out with great confidence, with hundreds of thumb rules which awelled in number as time passed and as the region of observation varied. After a comparative lull in the activity in this field during the period 1000-1500 A. D. in North India, some scholars took up the thread after 1600 A. D. and not only assembled all the past knowledge on the subject but also added the information that was current during their periods in their respective regions. One such important work is Vanamāla written by Jivanatha a Maithili scholar around 1700 A. D. Bhadrabāhu Samhita written by a Jain sanyasin would however appear to belong to a period earlier than 1500 A. D. Gurusamhita is a third work of this type. The date and author of this composition are not clear. Subsequently works in regional

languages incorporating all past and current knowledge also appeared on the scene. The works of Dak in Maithili, Ghaghar and Bhaddari in Hindi and Rajasthani, Vṛşti Prabodha in Gujarati and Sanskrit, Khana Vaoan in Bengali and siddhanta Darpaņa in Oriya are too well known. It has to be noted that many of these works contain both long range forecasting rules based mostly on the position of moon and sun with respect to the stars as well as short and medium range forecasting rules.

 Every meteorologist is well aware that local short and medium range forecasting calls for considerable skill and observing power on the part of the forecaster. Every parameter is very carefully followed and by experience the forecaster develops some skill in correctly forecasting the occurrence of rainfall well in advance. Conditions which repel rainfall which would otherwise occur especially during the rainy season are also rocognisable by the forecasters. It is to the credit of the post Vedic scholars to have identified several conditions pertaining to the earth's surface and the atmosphere which enabled them to frame rules for forecasting rainfall on short and medium range which may be broadly categorised as follows:

 1) Rules based on observations of wind, clouds, temperature, lightning, thunder, moisture in the atmosphere etc.

 2) Rules based on behaviour of men, animals, birds, snakes, worms, insects, trees, plants etc.

 3) Rules based on sky conditions like halo round the sun and the moon, colour of the sky, visual impression of morning and evening sun moon and stars etc.

 Madhusudan Ojha took great pains to consult many of the books on manuscripts, that were available to him and collected and presented these rules in his book Kadambini after arranging them in an orderly manner. It may be useful to the reader at this stage to know that Jayashankar. Devshankarji Sharma 49 has also written two volumes entilted Prakṛti se Varsa Jñān in Hindi in which he presents many rules for forecasting rainfall both in the long and short range after collecting them ftom various original texts. Dhuniram Tripathi's 50 Prāṇyabharatiyam Ṛtuvijñānam contains many quotations from origional texts on forecasting rules.

 Even a casual examination of the rules for short and medium range fore- casting of rainfall presented in the above books will reveal to any specialist the practical approach of our ancients to the problem. They knew well the parameters that mattered for them and used them after acquiring sufficient knowledge on them by case studies. Every observation including the behaviour of men, animals. trees etc. mattered for them and they made full use of them in their formulation of the rules. It will not be an exaggeration if one concludes from a perusal of their rules, that they were as conversant with local weather as any modern meteorologist who has recourse to number of sophisticated observational aids.

 The association of impending weather with halo round the sun and the moon and the diffraction rings round the discs of the sun and the moon as well as streaks of light emanating from the sun's visible disc has not been studied at all by meteorlogists. In fact we do not attach any importance to them at all for short range forecasting.

 In conclusion it may be said that the attempts of our ancients, towards development of thumb rules for short and meduim range forecasting have been more or less in the right direction and compare fairly well with the thumb rules used by the modern forecasters in the early stage of development of the subject.

**OBSERVATION AND MEASUREMENT OF METEOROLOGICAL AND OTHER  
ASSOCIATED PARAMETERS**

 The post-Vedic scholars fully recognised the need for collection of meteoro- logical and other associated data for forecasting rainfall both in the long and short range In the literature we find a very rich variety of observations which go to show the observational skill of our ancients. Wherever possible they made actual measurements also. We shall first deal with the observations of meteoro. logical perameters and then briefly touch upon the nonmeteorological ones also.

 1. WIND

 That the winds have an imporant role in the weather was known even to the Vedio seers. The replacement of the westerlies by moist easterlies ushering in the monsoon in their region was eagerly awaited by them and whenever it was delayed they performed rituals to propitiate the rain God. They had a general rule that wind from the east brings rains, wind from the west drives away rain, wind from the north favours rain and wind from the south does not produce any rain. They were also familiar with the hot and dust raising winds from southwest and because of the bad effects, the southwest direction itself was considered inauspicious.

 It is during the post-Vedic period that wind observations were intensified. The post Vedio scholars classified the wind into three types viz., *Bhāvaka, Sthāpaka, and Jñāpaka.* The Bhāvak wind was identified as that which produces clouds. It brings rain immediately or a few days later. Sthāpaka wind is one which was imagined to favour formation and nourishment of rain foetuses and its direction is characterised according to the season in which it is observed In other words it eslablishes the rain foetuses and protots thom. Jñāpaka wind is eharacteristic of the particular time of observation and reminds one, the season to follow.

 The post-Vedic scholars were familiar with observing the strength and direction of the wind by the movement of clouds. They also used the surer method of measuring wind direction with the help of a pole of 12 cubits in

length at the top of which a flag of black colour four cubits in length was attached 51. Whenever the wind was not steady, the wind direction was taken as the one from which the wind was stronger.

 The details we get in the literature regarding interpretation of wind direction in terms of weather that was likely to occur later, show that almost daily observations of wind at each place should have been made and some sort of a dairy kept on the same. Our ancients were more or less familiar with the local wind in the same way as a meteorologist whose knowledge is based on measurements by instruments,

 The post-Vedic scholars had also carefully observed changing wind direction especially whenever rain occurred due to a moving system. Many rules involving change of wind directions were framed by them. For example the following rule extracted from Kadambini obviously refers to a moving system.

 “When wind from the north is stopped and wind from the east blows, it portends rain for five days. When wind from the east stops and wind from the south blows, there will be rain for three more days. When the wind, from west is stopped and wind blows from the southwest the rain decreases. In fact they had such a good weather sense that they were able to foresee the occurrence of heavy rain four or five days ahead, based on wind observations.

 Our ancients had studied the seasonal winds which will ensure good monsoon rains and knew which were beneficial and which were harmful in every month or season. Many details of seasonal winds and their effects are available in literature. But unfortunately, unless one can fix the region in which they are applicable, there is the danger of mix up of the detail pertaining to different regions. In fact in later literature the authors themselves have throughly mixed up information of different regions. However people were quite knowledgeable and therfore they knew what rules were vaild for their region. Madhusudan Ojha in his work has collected and presented forecasting rules in which the winds observations have been utilised.

 2.CLOUDS

 Observations of clouds and their varied nature formed an important component of rainfall forecasting practices in ancient India. The shape, colour and nature of the cloud provided rich information and they carefully collected every detail and related it to expected rainfall. The following extracts from Brhatsamhita are typical examples.

 a) Clouds that resemble pearls, silver, kamala flower, lily or collyrium in colour and which are in the shape of aquatic animals will contain abundant water in the embryo. These clouds which have been scorched by the burning rays of the sun and fanned by a gentle breeze will at the time of delivery pour torrents of water as if they were angry.

 b) If the clouds are formed in the east, there will be growth of good crops; in the south-east, there will be raging of fires; in the south decay of crops ; in the southwest destruction of half the crops. In the west handsome rain; in the northwest stormy rain in some places; in the north good rain and in the northeast bumper crops. 53

 In Kṛṣi Parāśara we find four broad divisions of clouds viz. (*1)Āvarta (2)Samvarta (3) Puşkara and (4) Drona.* While *Āvarta* rains in particular areas only *Samvarta* rains everywhere. Rainfall will be scanty during the predomi. nence of *Puṣkara* Drona cloud on the other hand gives plenty of rain over wide areas. It is not difficult for a modern meteorologist to infer what clouds means low these represent. According to Madhusudan Ojha the word ‘*Abhra*' are called '*Ghana*' and spreading clouds. Cumulus clouds seen here and there Megha-clouds covering the sky like a sheet (stratus type) are called '*Ghata’*. mālāmanjari enumerates eighty types of clouds ten each in *Mandara, Kailāsa Koța, Jaṭhara, Sṛngavera, Paryanta, Himavat and Gandhamādana* mountains and the author even names them. Kautilya however while dealing with the clouds in the plains says that there are three typs of clouds which continuously rain for seven days, eighty that give light rain and sixty that are widespread. Another classification of the clouds names them *Nāga, Parvata, Vṛṣabha and Arbuda*. The clouds that are found in hill regions during winter giving solid precipitation are said to belong to *Diggaja* class. Description of clouds according to their visual shape was most common. They found elephants, bulls, pigs, trees, castles, oities in the clouds and attached importance to them. This was especially the case of cumulus clouds with some vertical development. Some were identi. fied as capable of giving rain while the others were said to bring no rain. Our a moving ancients were also familiar with the type of clouds associated with system, when it approaches their region. Many rules based on the use of clouds have been collected and presented by Madhusudan Ojha. Picturesque description of clouds has been presented by Varāhamihira in his *Bṛhatsamhitā*. Description of seasonal clouds also are available in literature.

 3. LIGHTNING

 Many of the treatises deal with lightning extensively. In fact many of them have a whole chapter on lightning. The observations on lightning were used by our ancients for forecasting rainfall as well as for forecasting good or bad days ahead, We give below some details available in Bhadrabāhu Samhitā as an illustration.

 1) If the sky is cloudy and at that time if lightning is seen in the east and its colour is white or yellow it surely brings rain the next day.

 2) If there is intense lightning in the east and its colour is red and at the same time if there is wind, there will be only light rain.

 3) If lightning of low intensity is accompanied by quick thunder and moving clouds, there will be good rain and sometimes hails occur.

 4) If the colour of lightning is that of saffron, it will be hot the next day and there will be heavy rain in the afternoon.

 5) If the sky is filled with blue clouds and it looks dark everywhere and if at that time there is lightning with blue colour and heavy thundering there is indication of an approaching storm with strong winds which will bring rain in three days.

 6) If there is intense lightning in the north and if the sky is overcast then in the morning there will be heavy rain.

 7) If the clouds are reddish in colour and if at that time during the day there is lightning, it indicates drought conditions ahead.

 There are many more such observations and forecasts in this work. All these show the care with which the observations have been made though one would hesitate to accept all the interpretations as given by the author. Ojha has collected many of them from various sources and has presented them in his book.

 4. THUNDER

 Moghamālamanjari gives interesting details about observations on thunder. Thunder heared in the morning brings immediate rain. If it is heard in the noon, is destroys rain. Thunder heard in the evening brings lot of rain. If thunder is heard in the previous night and rain follows it will last for three days. If it is heard at midnight it will bring very heavy rain and if it is heard towards the end of the night it will rain for a week. The author also gives forecasts of rain based on the nature of sound of the thunder ая heard bv 18. If it sounds‘*Ghumu Ghumu'* it portends heavy rain and prosperity. If it sounds *‘Kata Pata’* it will give only scanty rain. If it sounds ‘*Dha, Dha. Dha*' it will destroy rain. If an explosive sound is heard there will be hardship to people. But in all cases whenever thunder is heard and is preceded by lightning, it is considered auspicious.

 5. RAIN

 Observations of rainfall date back to Vedio period. While the initial observations during the Ṛgvedic period were purely qualitative, some classification emerged during the period of Yajurveda. As we have aready seen the Kāririṣti gives eight types of rainfall viz., *Jinvarāvṛt. Ugrarāvṛt Bhaumarvāṛ*t eto. Quantitative measurements of rainfall seem to have commenced around the beginning of the Christian era. Paņini in his Aṣtādhyāyi under the chapter ‘Varṣapramāṇa’ mentions *goṣpada* as a measure of rainfall.

 Regarding the time when one should start measuring the rain for estimating the total rainfall of the rainy season different views were held at that time. Varahamihira says that it should be commenced after the full moon day of the month *Jyaistha* when it has rained in the asterisms commencing with *Purvaṣadha*. He quotes another view 62 that the quantity of rainfall should be gauged when for the first time in the season, it rains sufficiently enough to make the ground free from dust or when drops of water are visible on the tips of blades of grass.

 According to Varahamihira the units of measurement of rainfall prevalent during his time (600 A. D) were *Pala,* *Ādhaka* and *Drona* (50 palas make one ādhaka and four ādhakas make one drona). The rain gauge 63 was round with a diameter of one hasta 18 inches) and had marks of palas. When it is full it indicated an *ādhaka* of rainfall. Based on the knowledge we have of ‘Pala' Madhusudan Ojha infers (vide Kadambinį) that one drona would mean two and a half inches of rain. This seems to be reasonable since, according to Kautilya 64 the annual rain in the Jangla area is 16 dronas i. e., 40 inches, 24 *dronas* in moist areas, 13½drones in *Aśmaka* country. 24 *Drones* in *Avanti* and a large quantity in the Himalayan region and in the regions where water channels are made use of in agriculture. Kautilya 65 also says that the superintendent of treasure house was entrusted with the duty of measuring rainfall with a gauge which was 18 inches (one aratni) in diameter. Samasambita, an earlier work of Varahamihira describes the *ādhaka* measurement as *Magadha māna.* This would support the hypothesis that the system of measurement of rainfall given by Kautilya and Varāhamihira was prevelent in North India for a long time (3rd Century B. C. to 6th Century A. D.)

 According to Parāgara, however the height and diameter of the rain gauge should be 8 angulas i. 6 inches and 20 angulas or 15 inches respectively and when it is filled to the brim it measures one ādhaka. Parāśara 67 also gives a method of measuring rainfall on the ground in a pit which is one hasta (18 inches) deep, one *hasta* broad and one *hasta* long. Kṛsi Parāśara gives a different definition of ādhaka. According to the author, the quantity of water spreading over 100 yojanas and extending to a height of 20 yojanas is equvalent to an ādhaka.

 According to Kautilya, if one third of the total annual rainfall came from the beginning and ending month of the rainy season, two thirds in the middle it angured good crops.

 6. SOLID PRECIPITATION

 The post-Vedic scholars had also made observations on precipitation in the form of snow in the hilly regions. They knew that thick fog becomes dew when the temperature decreases. Dew was called *Avasyāya*'. Thick fog was called

*Dhūmika*'. '*Kujati*' is another name for mist or fog *Tuṣāra*' is heavy snow fall. *Prāleya*' is forn and *Hima*' is the general term for snow. They were also familiar with hail which was called by them as‘*Karaka'*.

 7. OBSERVATIONS OF ATMOSPHERIC OPTICAL PHENOMENA

 Halos round the sun and the moon, different shapes and colours of the illuminated region around the sun, rainbows comets, meteors etc. were all carefully observed by our ancients and correlations were established with impending weather. Conditions of sky and colour just before sunset and just before rise were also observed and correlated with rainfall. According to Nārada the colour of the halo around the sun is indicative of rain. However so many colours have been included in this rule and one doubts whether the forecast has any significance at all. The halo round the sun is of two kinds viz, '*Paridhi* and *'Pariveṣa*” (vide Kādambini). The dull circular cloud-like structure round the sun's disc was associated with rain. Season wise changes in the structure of the halos were also studied by our ancients, Many authors have a whole chapter on ‘*Pariveṣa*'?

 Observations of rainbow were also made in the past. The shape and orientation the direction of its appearance, the apparent point of contact with the ground i. c.; whether it is water or plain ground or a tree mattered for them and rules were framed accordingly (vide Kādambini)

 The meteoric showers were objects of intense observation for our ancients. Several types were identified and meanings were attached to them. Fiery skies dustborne skies, comets, eclipses, conjunction of planets etc., were also observed by them and interpreted in their own way. Madhusudan Ojha has collected lot of information on these and has presented them in his book.

 We have come to the end of our story. It covers a long period of more than four thousand years. It is hoped that the reader will now appreciate the tremendous efforts put in by our ancients into this fascinating and important branch of science. It is to the credit of Madhusūdan Ojha to have taken great pains to collect the information from various sources and present them to us in his most characteristic way.

 प्रारम्भ में जब मैंनें उन गहन विषयों को उठाया तो वास्तव में मुझे बारंबार यही प्रतीत होताथा कि मुझ जैसे अकिंचन व्यक्ति का यह साहस सर्वथा अनुपयुक्त हुआ है, और मैं उस असहनीय शोक के साथ २ इस बड़ी चिन्ता में स्तब्धसा होगया कि यह कैसे पार पड़ेगा क्योंकि ग्रन्थों की सम्पन्न कापियां अथवा प्रेस कापियां विभिन्न लेखकों द्वारा लिखवाई गई थीं, उनमें न केवल अशुद्धियां ही थीं प्रत्युत अनेक स्थानों में पंक्ति की पंक्ति और कहीं कहीं तो वाक्य संदर्भ भी लुप्त थे और क्रोडपत्र ( रफकापी ) इस प्रकार से यन्त्र - कुत्र तथा सब ग्रंथों के सामूहिक रूप में रखने वालों ने अव्यवस्थित ढंग से रख छोडे थे और वह भी संपूर्णतः न मिलने से यह एक बड़ा ही दुस्साध्य कार्य मेरे सामने उपस्थित हुआ जिस के कारण प्रन्थों के प्रकाशन में आवश्यकता से अधिक विलम्ब होना तो स्वाभाविक है। जिनकी प्रतिलिपि नहीं हुई हैं और मूलग्रन्थ का भी कुछ अश उनमें जो सम्पूर्ण अनुपलब्ध हैं उनमें अवश्य ही बड़ी कठिनाई है।

 अस्तु ! मैं अपने कर्त्तव्य पथपर धैर्ये तथा दृढ़ता पूर्वक स्थिर रह कर "कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन" के सिद्धान्त पर ही अपना अधिकांश समय इसी कार्य में लगा रहा हूँ !

 आज कई महीने निरन्तर लगे रहने से ईश्वर की असीम कृपा साथ ही पूज्य पिताजी के आशीर्वाद से "गच्छन् पिपीलको याति योजनानां शतान्यपि" इस उक्ति के अनुसार मैं दो चार ग्रंथों को तैयार कर सका हूँ जो मुद्रणार्थ विभिन्न प्रेसों में दिये जा चुके हैं।

 श्रीमान् जयपुर नरेश ने पूज्य पिताजी के जीवन काल में ही उन के श्रीमद्भगवङ्गीता के विज्ञानभाष्य प्रकाशित किये जाने के लिये जो द्रव्य प्रदान किया जिससे उसके दो काण्ड

(रहस्य और मूलकाण्ड) मुद्रित हो चुके हैं और शेष दो यन्त्रालय में हैं। महाराज की इस उदारता के लिये मैं हृदय से कृतज्ञ हूँ। यह सर्व विदित है कि जयपुर राज्य से हमारा संबन्ध चिरकालीन है उसे पूज्य पिताजी ने भी अपने ग्रन्थों में स्वीकार किया है। अतः इस विषय में विशेष लिखना व्यर्थ है, और अब भी मैं श्रीमान् जयपुराधीश की छत्र-छाया में ही रहता हूँ। मुझे हार्दिक विश्वास है कि ग्रन्थ प्रकाशन के इस सत्कार्य में श्रीमान् से मुझे पूर्ण सहायता मिलती रहेगी।

 मुझे इन ग्रन्थों के प्रकाशन के हेतु आर्थिक सहायता के लिये जो सान्त्वना श्रीमान् अलवरेन्द्र से मिली है उसके लिये मुझे कोई शब्द दृष्टिगोचर नहीं होता जिससे मैं उनके प्रति अपनी हार्दिक कृतज्ञता प्रकट कर सकू। मेरे व्यक्तिगत परिचय के अनुसार मुझे यह आशा है कि यद्यपि आप कार्यक्षेत्र में अभी प्रविष्ट हुए हैं, तथापि आपका विद्या-प्रेम और अन्य सद्गुण आपके सुयश प्रसार में अवश्यमेव सहायक होंगे।

 यहाँ यह कथन भी अवसर प्राप्त है कि हमारे मिथिलाधीश्वर श्रीमान् महाराजाधिराज दरभंगाने ग्रन्थ प्रकाशन समिति के संरक्षक होने का सहर्ष वचन दिया है। श्रीमान् तथा श्रीमान् के स्वर्गीय पिताजी का न केवल मुझ से और मेरे पूज्य पिताजी से ही किन्तु आपके पूर्वजों का मेरे अन्य पूर्वजों से भी यथेष्ट सम्बन्ध रहा है और तदनुसार उनने मेरे पूर्वजों की विद्वत्ता का उचित आदर किया है। दरभंगा विद्याका केन्द्र है और उनके सभी पूर्वज प्रायः विद्यानुरागी और विद्वान होते आये इसलिये उनकी गुणग्राहकता के विषय में विशेष लिखना अनावश्यक है, किन्तु इतना कह देना पयाप्त है कि आपने मुझे जिस तरह प्रोत्साहित किया है वह अवश्य ही मेरे लिये अविस्मरणीय है।

 इन ग्रन्थों के संपादन तथा प्रकाशन के कार्य में म० म० पं० गिरिधरजी शर्मा चतुर्वेदी अध्यक्ष (प्रिंसिपैल) महाराजाज संस्कृत कालेज जयपुर, पं० आया दत्तजी ठाकुर एम० ए० काव्यतीर्थ प्रोफेसर लखनऊ यूनीवर्सीटी, जयपुरीय पं० बद्रीनाथजी शास्त्री एम० ए० रिटायर्ड प्रोफेसर लखनौऊ यूनीवर्सीटी, पं० सूर्यनारायणजी आचार्य संस्कृत प्रोफेसर महाराजाज़ कालेज जयपुर, पं० पुरुषोत्तम जी साहित्याचार्य धर्मशिक्षक व संस्कृत प्रोफेसर मेवोकालेज अजमेर, प० मदनलालजी प्रश्नवर व्याकरणानायं रिटायर्ड प्रोफेसर महाराजाज संस्कृत कालेज जयपुर तथा पं० जयचन्द्र झा जी वेद के प्रोफेसर महाराजाज संस्कृत कालेज जयपुर समय समय पर मुझे सत्परामर्श द्वारा पूर्ण प्रोत्साहित करते रहे हैं जिसके लिये इन विद्वज्जनों का मैं बड़ा उपकृत हूँ। साथ ही नन्दकिशोरजी शर्मा से जो पूज्य पिताजी के समय से ही मेरे यहाँ के लाईब्रेरियन हैं इन अमुद्रित ग्रन्थों के संकलन में मुझे बड़ी सहायता प्राप्त हुई है।

 जो २ ग्रन्थ पूर्व में मुद्रित होचुके हैं उनमें कादम्बिनी जिसकी प्रथमावृत्ति सं० १९७९ वि० में प्रकाशित हुई थी तथा आशौचपंजिका जो पहिले सं० १९७५ वि० में प्रकाशित हुई थी इन दोनों का द्वितीय संस्करण भी अत्यावश्यक होगया है क्योंकि ये प्रायः अधिक उपयोगी हैं और इनके लिये बहुत मांगें भी बराबर आ रही हैं ।

 यह प्रायः सर्वविदित है कि पूज्य पिताजी यह वैज्ञानिक तत्व यद्यपि हिन्दी भाषा में भी भली प्रकार प्रतिपादन कर सकते थे तथापि उनकी संस्कृत में ही हार्दिक अभिरुचि थी इसलिये उन्होंने जो कुछ भी विवेचनायें किई वह संस्कृत भाषा में हैं। जैसा कि उन्होंने यह वैदिक विज्ञान का रिसर्च (Research) किया है, वह यदि हिन्दी में होता तो आज इसकी ख्याति संसार में द्रुतगति से होकर यह विशेष उपयोगिता में आता, परन्तु उनकी संस्कृत में प्रगाढ रुचि के कारण ही ऐसा नहीं हो सका । इतने पर भी यद्यपि विषय तो अवश्य बहुत गहन और मार्मिक हैं तथापि संस्कृत भाषा उन्होने बहुत ही सरल रक्खी है । साथही विषयों को आधुनिक रीति से समझाते हुए आवश्यकतानुसार मान चित्र आदि भी देकर यथाशक्य सरल बनाया है जिससे संस्कृत भाषा के जाननेवाले उनकी विवेचना को भली प्रकार समझ सकें।

 कुछ वर्ष हुए कादम्बिनी के भाषानुवाद के लिये प्रयाग के अर्थशास्त्राध्यापक श्रीयुत् दयाशंकरजी दुबे, एम. ए., एल. एल. बी. के आग्रह पुरस्सर पूर्ण अनुरोध करने पर पिताजी ने इस प्रस्ताव को स्वीकार कर लिया था। जिसके लिये उक्त दुबेजी ने यहाँ जयपुर के ही काइरोपाह्न पं० नवलकिशोरजी गौड को जो उन दिनों हमारे यहाँ ही पूज्य पिताजी के निरीक्षण में उनके रचित ग्रन्थों की प्रेसकापी आदि का उचित रूप से संपादन कराने का कार्य करते थे कादम्बिनी के अनुवाद के लिये समय समय पर पिताजी से अनुरोध करते रहने का भार दिया । काङ्करजी ने भी जब जब समय पाया पिताजी से निवेदन करके जितना कुछ वह कहते उसे लिखलिया। इस प्रकार अन्ततोगत्वा कादम्बिनी का हिन्दी अनुवादपूर्ण होगया। इसके अनन्तर इस ग्रन्थ की भूमिका के रूप में वृष्टि का ज्ञातव्य विषय भी पिताजी ने लिखा । श्रीयुत दुबेजी की इच्छाथी कि वह स्वयं इस ग्रन्थ को छपवावें, परन्तु वह ऐसा न कर सके और इसी कारण से इसका प्रकाशन भी अभी तक नहीं हो पाया, किन्तु यह कहना होगा कि इस हिन्दी अनुवाद के तैयार कराने का श्रेय दुबेजी महोदय को ही है साथही पं० नवलकिशोरजी की भी तत्परता में कमी नहीं।

 आज मैं उसी हिन्दी भाषानुवाद सहित कादम्बिनी को सुचारु रूप से संपादित करके पाठकों के सम्मुख उपस्थित कर रहा हूँ, मुझे यह पूर्ण आशा है कि पाठकवृन्द इसकी वृष्टि विषयक विवेचना से पूर्ण लाभ उठायेंगे।

 अन्त में मेरी यही प्रार्थना है कि विद्या-प्रेमी संसार मुझे यह हार्दिक शुभाशीर्वाद देवें कि मैं अपने श्रद्धेय पूज्य पिताजी की कृतियों को प्रकाशित कर अपने कर्त्तव्य धर्म के पालन में सफलता प्राप्त कर सकू ।

**यदा यदा हि धर्मस्य ग्लानिर्भवति भारत।  
अभ्युत्थानमधर्मस्य तदात्मानं सृजाम्यहम् ॥ (गीता )**

 इस भगवदुक्ति के अनुसार जब जब वैदिक मत्यविद्या अज्ञान धूमसे आवृत होने लगती है और मोह वश जनता का विश्वास हटने लगना है, तब परमेश्वर की प्रेरणा से कोई शक्ति प्रकट होकर सत्यविद्या व सत्यधर्म को राहुप्रास से मुक्तकर अज्ञान का नाश कर देती हैं। वेद एक सत्य-विद्या है और वैदिक धर्म सत्यधर्म है, अतएव इनकी रक्षाका आयोजन ईश्वर की ओर से समय समय पर सदा होता रहता है, जिसकी सारी इतिहास दे रहे हैं। वर्तमान समय भी वेद विद्या और वैदिक धर्म के लिये एक प्रचंड आपत्ति का समय है। पुराने इतिहास की खोज के लिये चाहे आज नाम मात्र को वेद का गौरभ माना जाता हो, किन्तु वेद सत्यविद्या का निधान है, सब प्रकार के विज्ञानों का मूल स्रोत है, या भारतीय विज्ञान सूर्य के प्रकाश का पूर्ण विवरणात्मक इतिहास है, इस अटल सत्य को मानने के लिये आज की शिक्षित जनता तैय्यार नहीं। वैदिक धर्म्म एक वैज्ञानिक धर्म है, त्रिकालावाध्य एक रस है, यह विश्वास आज पाश्चात्य क्रमसे शिक्षित जनता के अंतः करण में स्थान नहीं पाता। पावे कहाँ से ? आज सत्य-विद्या या सत्य-धर्म की तौल होती है वस्तु-विज्ञान (Science) की तराजू पर? वस्तुविज्ञान ही इस युग की मुख्य विद्या है। वस्तु विज्ञान को वर्त्तमान शैली के अनुकूल प्रस्फुटित करने वाला कोई वेद का माध्य आजतक उपलब्ध नहीं। वैदिक धर्म का वस्तु-विज्ञानों से सम्बन्ध बताने के साधन कालसमुद्र की तरंगों में लीन हो चुके हैं, फिर विज्ञानराशि कहकर वेद का गौरव इस युग में किस आधार पर टिक सके ! बस, नाममात्र की श्रद्धा वेदकी बच गई है। “इलहामी पुस्तक” कहकर कुछ आस्तिक लोग “कुरान” आदि की तरह उस पर भी श्रद्धा कर लेते हैं; किन्तु श्रद्धा का आधार अंधकारमय है। यह निराधार श्रद्धा कितने दिन चल सकती है ? इस बीसवीं शताब्दी में अंधविश्वास का कहाँ ठिकाना? भारत के कई योग्य आधुनिक विद्वानों ने वेद गौरव शिक्षा के लिये वस्तु विज्ञान से वेद का सम्बन्ध दिखाने का प्रयत्न किया, किन्तु भारतीय शास्त्रों की नियत परिभाषा के अनुसार क्रमबद्ध विज्ञान का मूल वेद में न बताया जासका और बिना उसके वैज्ञानिकों का विश्वास उस विवरण

पर नहीं जम सकता था। वे इधर उधर की से उड़ी बातें कह कर ऐसे प्रयत्नों को उपहास काही स्थान मानते रहे। जब तक क्रमबद्ध रूप में वैज्ञानिकों को स्पष्ट न बता दिया जाय कि वेद में वस्तु विज्ञान की इतनी ऊँची परिभाषाएँ हैं कि जहाँ तक का बीसवीं शताब्दी के वैज्ञानिकों को स्वप्न भी नहीं आया। जब तक यह सिद्ध न कर दिया जाय कि आधुनिक वस्तुविज्ञान की बहुत सी उलझनें वैदिकविज्ञान की शरण में आने से अनायास सुलझ सकती हैं तब तक वैज्ञानिक जगत् वेद का यथोचित गौरव नहीं मान सकता। किन्तु जगन्नियन्ता जगदीश्वर को यह कब सहा होसकता था कि सत्यविद्या का गौरव विज्ञान के मध्याह्नकाल में छिपा रह जाय? उसने एक ऐसे प्रतिभाशाली व्यक्ति को संसार क्षेत्र में उतार दिया, जिसने उसी जगन्नियन्ता की प्रेरणा से अपनी सब श्रायु वैदिक-विज्ञान और वैदिक- इतिहास के अन्वेषण में लगाकर उक्त महत्व पूर्ण विज्ञान और इतिहास का एक क्रमबद्ध सूत्र तय्यार कर ही डाला, जिसके अतुल परिश्रम और अलौकिक प्रतिभा के प्रकाश से अनेक शताब्दियों से अमूल्य विज्ञान रनों को अपने उदर में छिपा रखने या गुहा का द्वार आज देखने में आ गया और उसमें प्रवेश करने वालों को परम सौकथ्य मिल गया। वही व्यक्ति हमारे (चरित नायक) गुरुवर जयपुर राज्य के प्रधान राज पंडित समीक्षा-चक्रवर्ती स्वर्गीय पं० श्री मधुसूदनजी ओझा विद्यावाचस्पति हुए। आपका वैदिक अन्वेषण सम्बन्धी कार्य जब पूर्ण रूपसे प्रकाश में श्वावेगा तब विद्वज्जन हमारी इन पंक्तियों की सत्यता का अनुभव करेंगे यह हमें पूर्ण विश्वास है।

 अस्तु ऐसे महापुरुषों का पवित्र परिचय जाति की एक सम्पत्ति होती है, कार्य-क्षेत्र में उत्तर- ने वालों के लिये योग्यतम आदर्श होता है, और विद्या रसिकों के लिये कौतूहल वर्द्धक होता है। इस विचार से श्री पंडितजी महाराज का संक्षिप्त परिचय पाठकों के समक्ष प्रस्तुत किया जाता है।

 विहार प्रान्त में मिथिला के मुजफ्फरपुर जिले के गाढ़ा नामक प्राम में जोकि रेलवे स्टेशन सीतामढ़ी से दक्षिण की ओर दश भील की दूरी पर है पंडित श्री वैद्यनाथ ओझाजी के घर वि० सं० १९२३ में श्रीकृष्ण जन्माष्टमी (भा० कृ० ८) की रात्रिको १०३ बजे मृगशिरानक्षत्र में आपका जन्म हुआ।

**आपकी जन्म कुण्डली इस प्रकार है।**

**![](../books_images/U-IMG-1730250980k9.png)**

 आपका कुल एक प्रसिद्ध विद्वान और प्रतिष्ठित पुरुषों का परम्पराका है। आपका बाल्यकाल स्वदेश में पिता के पास ही लालन-पालन व प्रारम्भिक शिक्षा में व्यतीत हुआ आपके पिता के बड़े भाई पं० राजीवलोचनजी ओझा जिनने जयपुर महाराज स्व० रामसिंहनी से अतुल सम्मान और पूर्ण जीविका प्राप्त की थी, उनके कोई सन्तान न थी इससे वे अपने छोटे भ्राता वैद्यनाथ झा के पुत्र श्री मधुसूदन झा जी को अपना दत्तक पुत्र बनाकर यज्ञोपवीत संस्कार के अनन्तर वि० सं• १९३२ में अपने साथ जयपुर ले आये और जयपुर में ही उच्चकक्षा के विद्वानों के पास आपके पठन पाठन का प्रबन्ध किया गया। पं० श्री राजीवलोचनजी अपने साथ महाराजा साहिब के पास भी उक्त पंडितजी को लेजाया करते थे पण्डितजी बचपन से ही बड़े कुशाग्र बुद्धि थे अतः कभी कभी महाराज के प्रेम पूर्वक किसी प्रश्न का बड़ी मधुरता और बुद्धिमत्ता से उत्तर देते, जिससे महाराज इनको वात्सल्य पूर्णं प्रेम दृष्टि से देखते और पंडित राजीवलोचनजी से यह कहा करते कि यह लड़का बड़ा होनहार मालुम होता है।

 पाँच छः वर्ष व्यतीत हुये थे उक्त पण्डितजी सिद्धान्तकौमुदी ही पढ रहे थे कि इम अवसर में आपके पितृव्य राजीवलोचन आझा जी का स्वर्गवास होगया। इसके एक या डेढ़ वर्ष बाद ही महाराज रामसिंहजी का भी स्वर्गवास होगया। अतः इन घटनाओं से आपके जीवन क्रम का एकदम परिवर्तित होजाना एक स्वाभाविक बात थी किन्तु चरित्र नायक को स्वाभाविक विद्या का व्यसन था, आपको विद्याध्ययन के अतिरिक्त और कुछ अच्छा नहीं लगता था। अब जयपुर में विद्या प्राप्ति का सुयोग न देखकर इन्हें अपनी पितृव्य पत्नी के साथ सं० १९३६ वि० में अपनी जन्म भूमि को प्रस्थान करना पड़ा, किन्तु वहाँ भी अध्ययन क्रम आपकी रुचि के अनुकूल नहो सका और आपकी विद्या पिपासा अति प्रबल थी, इस कारण आप अपने कुटुम्बियों को समझा बुझा कर अध्ययनार्थ काशी चले गये, वहाँ दरभंगा पाठशाला में स्वनाम धन्य म० म० स्वर्गीय श्री शिवकुमार मिश्र जी के समीप विद्याध्ययन करने लगे और लगातार ८ वर्ष तक वहाँ ही पढ़ते रहे। अपने उत्कट परिश्रम तथा अद्भुत् बुद्धि के कारण, व्याकरण, न्याय, साहित्य, मीमांसा, वेदान्त आदि के ग्रन्थों का आपने गुरु मुख से न केवल अध्ययन ही कर लिया प्रत्युत उन पर पूर्ण अधिकार भी प्राप्त कर लिया। आपने काशी में विद्याध्ययन के अतिरिक्त भगवान् कामेश्वर शंकर की उपासना भी बड़े मनोयोग से की जिससे आपको विद्योन्नति में पूर्ण सफलता प्राप्त हुई।

 आपका विवाह १७ वर्ष की अवस्था में अलवर के राजगुरू पं० श्री चंचल भोझाजी मन्त्र शास्त्री की कन्या से वि० सं० १९४० में हुआ। इस समय चंचल झा के सुपुत्र पं० रामभद्र भोमाजी राज्य के लब्ध प्रतिष्ठ रिटायर्ड जुडीशियल मिनिस्टर हैं।

 काशी में विद्याध्ययन पूर्ण कर पंडितजी बूँदी, कोटा, झालरापाटन, रतलाम आदि के नरेशों से मिले और पूर्ण सम्मानित हुए। अन्त में जयपुर राज्य से विशेष अनुरोध होने पर वि० सं० १९४६ में जयपुर चले आये।

 जयपुर में आते ही पण्डितजी महाराजाज़ कालेज में संस्कृत प्रोफेसर नियुक्त हुए बीच में आपने कुछ समय संस्कृत कालेज में वेदान्त के प्रधान अध्यापक का कार्य भी किया था। इस अरसे में कई घटना ऐसी हुई जिनसे आपके प्रखर पाण्डित्य की महिमा भूतपूर्व जयपुर नरेश स्व० महाराज माधवसिंहजी के कानों तक पहुँची और गुणग्राहक महाराजने इन्हें अपने आत्मिक परिजनों में नियुक्त कर वि० सं० १९५१ में निजी पुस्तकशाला का प्रबन्ध इनके अधीन कर दिया व मौजमन्दिर (धर्मसभा) का सभापति बना दिया और राज्य के सर्व प्रधान पंडित मान कर परम आदर पूर्वक अपने पास रक्खा। श्रीमान् प्रायः नित्य ही कुछ समय इनसे शास्त्रीय वार्तालाप किया करते थे जिसका महाराज पर इतना प्रभाव पड़ा कि वह पण्डितजी की अनुमति बिना कोई भी धार्मिक कार्य नहीं करते थे।

 पंडितजी महाराज न केवल शास्त्रों ही में नैपुण्य रखते थे अपितु शासननीति में भी आप पूर्ण प्रवीण थे, अतः समय २ पर महाराज के नैतिक विषयों में भी आप से वार्तालाप होता रहता था इस प्रकार पण्डितजी स्व० जयपुर नरेन्द्र के उच्चकोटि के कृपापात्रों में से बन गये और महाराज के नवरत्नों में आपकी गणना थी। जयपुर राज्य के उच्चसामन्तों के समान आप आदरणीय थे। और आपका प्रभाव राज्य वर्ग में तथा प्रजाजनों में बहुत विशेष था। आपको महाराज ने आजीविका भी पूर्ण दे रक्खी थी, इसलिये रईसों के समान ही आपका जीवन बीता।

 सन् १९०२ ई० में भारत सम्राट् एडवर्ड सप्तम के राज्याभिषेक के समय जो ऐतिहासिक विलायत यात्रा हुई थी, उसका सब धार्मिक आयोजन पण्डितजी के सत्परामर्शानुसार ही हुआ था और महाराजाधिराज इन्हें भी अपने साथ लेगये थे। वहाँ संस्कृत के यूरोपियन विद्वान जब आप से मिले तो बड़े प्रभावान्वित हुए और शीघ्र ही वहाँ आपकी कीर्ति फैल गई। वहाँ के व्याक्स फोर्ड के प्रसिद्ध विद्वान् मैकडोनल्ड, कैम्ब्रिज के विद्वद्वर बैंडाल और इंडिया आफिस पुस्तकालयाध्यक्ष टामस पडितजी से मिलकर इनकी वैज्ञानिक विवेचनाओं पर मुग्ध होगये और आपका बड़ा सम्मान सत्कार उनने किया। आपका वहाँ वेद धर्म पर एक बड़ा जोरदार व्याख्यान भी हुआ (जो जयपुर के संस्कृत ग्नाकर मासिकपत्र में कई वर्ष पहले छप चुका है) इससे वहाँ के सभी विद्वज्जन आश्चर्यान्वित हुये और भाप के कारण वैदिक धर्म का डंका विलायत में गूंज उठा।

 उक्त कथन की सत्यता प्रमाणित करने को विलायत से प्रकाशित होनेवाले समाचार पत्रों के कुछ अंश नीचे दिये जाते हैं।

***The Westminister Gazette*—26.7.02  
A Hindoo savant in London.**

 In the back ground of the group of personages who have come to London for the Coronation, the presence has remained unnoticed of a hindoo savant, a great celebrity in India, a human store house of vedic wisdom and philosophy. This is a pundit Madhusudan Ojha a profound sanskrit scholar. The pundit's conversation in fluent Sanskrit greatly interested the Cambridge orientalist in his Eastern visitor.

**The Sun—23.7.02.**

 The Pundit visited Professor Macdonald of Oxford who was greatly pleased to cultivate his acquaintance. Last Sunday the pundit was invited to cambridge by Professor C. Bendall who with his wife gave him a warm reception. What interested the cambridge orientalist most was the conver sation of the Pundit in fluent Sanskrit which is a rare treat now even in India while he was deeply impressd by the deep learning of his eastern visitor.

 सम्राट् के राज्याभिषेक के अवसर पर पंण्डितजी महाराजने कुछ पद्य बनाकर इङ्गलिश अनुवाद सहित छपाकर सम्राट् को समर्पित किये थे, जिनकी सादर स्वीकृति के साथ सम्राट् ने आपको मैडिल तथा एक लिखित धन्यवाद पत्र से सम्मानित किया था।

 पण्डितजी महाराज सदा वैदिकविज्ञान की खोज में हीं लगे रहते थे। आपका संपूर्ण समय वेद रहस्य के उद्घाटन के प्रयत्न में ही बीतता था। आप अस्वस्थ होजाने की दशा में भी अपना कार्य करते ही रहते थे। अपने शरीर, स्वास्थ्य, आराम व अर्थोपार्जन आदि सब बातों की उपेक्षा कर यह महान् कार्य आपने आजीवन किया। आपके लगभग ५० वर्ष घोर तपस्या के रूप में बीते, जिस तपस्या के फल स्वरूप आपके लिखे हुए १२५ से भी अधिक ग्रन्थ विद्यमान हैं, जो संस्कृत विद्या, सनातनधर्म और भारतवर्ष का वैज्ञानिक युग में मस्तक ऊँचा करने के लिये पर्याप्त साधन है। आपने अपने हाथोंसे इन सब प्रन्थों की पाण्डुलिपि साथही प्रतिलिपि लिखी है इनमें दो चार प्रन्थों के अतिरिक्त प्रत्येक ग्रन्थ २०० से ५०० पृष्ठ तक के हैं और कोई कोई तो इससे भी अधिक हैं। इतनी मौलिक रचना करलेना कोई मामूली बात नहीं है। आपका लेख भी बड़ा सुन्दर छापे के सदृश होता था और आप चित्रकला में भी कुशल थे।

 राजकार्य और ग्रन्थ लेखन व्यसन के कारण विशेष देश भ्रमण का अवसर पंडितजी को नहीं मिला इसीलिये आपके असाधारण पांडित्य व अलौकिक वैदिक रहस्योद्घाटन शैली और विषयों के प्रवचन की चतुरता का भारतीयों को विशेष परिचय प्राप्त नहो सका, किन्तु जब कभी भी ऐसा अवसर प्राप्त हुआ, तब श्रोतागणों को चित्रित् होता हुआ ही देखा और धीरे धीरे देश में आपकी ख्याति बढ़ती हो गई।

 सन् १९०६ ई० में काशी में कांग्रेस सभा के अवसर पर और प्रयाग के सम्बत् १९६२ वि. कुम्भ के अवसर पर जो भारतधर्म महामण्डल के महाधिवेशन हुए थे, जिनमें सभी भारतीय नरेशों को सानुरोध निमन्त्रण भेजा गया था, वहां जयपुर राज्य की ओर से पण्डितजी महाराज गये थे। उस समय भूतपूर्व दरभंगा नरेश के सभापतित्व में आपका भाषण सुनकर न केवल विद्धन्मण्डली ही, किन्तु अंग्रेजी के बड़े २ विद्वान् और साधारण जनता भी मुग्ध तथा गद्गद होगये। बहुत दिनों तक यह आपकी ख्याति कई समाचार पत्रों में प्रकाशित होती रही थी उसी अवसर पर भारतधर्म–महामण्डल की ओर से आपको विद्यावाचस्पति तथा महामहोपदेशक इन दो परवियों से विभूषित किया गया था। इसके अतिरिक्त आपके अभिभाषण लाहौर. काशी, कलकत्ता आदि में भी बड़े जोरदार हुए थे, जिनसे उपस्थित जनता बहुत प्रभावान्वित हुई और आपको बड़े सम्मान पूर्वक अभिनन्दन पत्र समर्पित किये गये। आप वैदिक गहन विषयों के उदूघटनार्थ शास्त्रों का अवलोकन तथा लेखन का कार्य तो करते ही रहते थे साथ ही जिज्ञासु वर्गों को प्रायः नित्यही कुछ समय अनेक विषयों को समझाया भी करते थे। आपकी प्रवचन शैली बहुत ही उच्चकोटि की थी आप श्रोताओं के हृदय में वस्तुज्ञान पूर्ण रूपेण जमा देते थे श्रोतालोग अद्भुत विषयों को सुन कर चकित तथा मुग्ध होजाते। कोई भी विषय जब तक जिज्ञासुओं की समझ में पूरे तौर से न आजाता तब तक वह अनेक प्रकार से घंटो तक उस वस्तु की मीमांसा करते ही रहते थे। इस कार्य में उनका मस्तिष्क कभी नहीं थकता था। उनमें यह एक खास बात थी कि गूढ़तम तत्वों के बिचार में इतना प्रबल परिश्रम अहर्निश करते रहने पर भी उनका मस्तिष्क अश्रान्त ही दीख पड़ता था। इस अत्यधिक परिश्रम के कारण पाचन शक्ति की कमी से उनका स्वास्थ्य तो ठीक नहीं रहत था और शरीर बड़ा कृश था, किन्तु लिखने या बोलने में वे कभी नहीं रुकते थे। वे बहुत ही स्वल्पाहारी थे, कभी न तो वे अपनी इस धुन में भोजन करना तक भूल जाते थे, दो चार बार ताकीद करने पर भोजन के लिये जाना तो नित्य नियम साही था।

 पण्डितजी महाराजके समीप जिज्ञासुओं के आने जाने की संख्याही क्या होसकती थी, देश विदेश से लोग नई नई शंकाओं को सुलझाने के लिये उपस्थित हुआ करते थे।

 वर्तमान जयपुर नरेश महाराज श्री १०८ श्री मानसिंहजी को महाराज कुमार अवस्था में

हिन्दी संस्कृत की प्रथम शिक्षा का आरम्भ पंडितजी महाराज ने हीं कराया था। स्वर्गीय भूतपूर्व महाराज माधवसिंहजी के अनुसार वर्तमान जयपुरनरेन्द्र भी धार्मिक विषयों में सभी परामर्श पंडितजी से ही लिया करते थे, ये पंण्डितजी को बड़ी श्रद्धा तथा मानकी दृष्टि से देखते थे और उन के पांडित्य से बहुत प्रभावान्वित रहते थे।

 अन्यान्य कई राजा महाराजा भी आपको बड़ी सम्मान की दृष्टि से देखते थे। स्वर्गीय तथा वर्तमान श्रीमान् दरभंगा महाराज का आप पर बड़ा ही प्रेम प्रसाद था, साथ ही आपकी इस अद्वितीय विद्वत्ता को वे अपना निजी गौरव समझते थे। वर्तमान् अलवर नरेश ने तो अपने यज्ञोपवित के अवसर पर भाप से ही दीक्षा ग्रहण की थी और आपको अपना सर्वश्रेष्ठ गुरू मानकर ये आपका बहुत ही सम्मान करते थे। स्व० महाराज किशनगढ, स्व० भूतपूर्व काशी नरेश तथा शाहपुराधीश भी आपके बड़े भक्त थे।

 इतने पर भी एक विशेषता थी कि पंडितजी ने राजा महाराजा बड़े २ सेठ आदि किसी से भी कभी कोई याचना नहीं की। आप स्वतन्त्र प्रकृति और निरपेक्ष व्यक्ति थे। साथ ही आपकी प्रकृति अति शान्त और नितान्त सरल थी। आप का रहन सहन बहुत ही सादगी का था। संसार में रहकर भी संसार से अलग थे यह आप में एक अलौकिक गुण था। आपको किसी प्रकार का कोई शौक या वांछा कभी नहीं हुई यदि थी तो सर्वोपरि वही एक मात्र वैदिकविज्ञान के आविहकार का पराकाष्ठा का व्यसन, और इसी में मनसावाचा कर्मणा अन्तश्वास तक वे तल्लीन भी रहे बल्कि प्राण वियोग के समय तक इसी का मनन रहा।

 यों तो पंडितजी महाराज के शिष्यों की संख्या बहुत हैं, परन्तु जिनने नियम पूर्वक पुस्तक खोलकर आपसे विद्याध्यन किया से भी कम नहीं है। इन पंकृतियों के लेखक ने प्रायः ४० वर्ष किसी रूप में उनके चरणों में बैठकर अध्ययन किया है। मृत्यु से ३ दिन पूर्व भी मेरा पाठ हुआ था और भी बहुत से प्रतिष्ठित विद्वान् उनके शिष्य हैं जिन में से कुछ विद्वानों के नाम निम्नलिखित हैंः—

 वि० सं० १९६३ में अखिल भारतवर्षीय संस्कृत-साहित्य सम्मेलन की ओर से जयपुर के गण्य मान्य सरदारों, विद्वानों और सेठ साहूकारों की स्वागत समिति के तत्वावधान में पंडितजी महाराज के ७० वें वर्ष के उपलक्ष में आचार्य प्रवर गोस्वामी श्री १००८ श्री गोकुलनाथजी महाराज शुद्धाद्वैत संप्रदायाचार्य बम्बई के सभापतित्व में रामनिवास बाग के अलवर्ट हाल में हीरकजयन्ती (Diamond Jubilee) मनाई गई थी जिसमें बाहर के अनेक प्रसिद्ध विद्वान म० म० हाथी भाई शास्त्रीजी राजपण्डित जामनगर (काठियावाड़), म० म० पं० मथुराप्रसादजी दीक्षित राजपंडित सोलन (पंजाब), विद्यामार्त्तण्ड पं० सीताराम शास्त्री भिवानी, पं० विद्याधर शास्त्रीजी एम. ए. प्रोफेसर डूंगर कालेज बीकानेर आदि भी सम्मिलित हुए थे। संस्कृतरत्नाकर मासिकपत्र का (वेदाङ्क) नाम का विशेषाङ्क और अभिनन्दनपत्र पंडितजी महाराज को समर्पित किया गया था। और इस श्र में संस्कृत तथा हिन्दी में पंडितजी महाराज का जीवन चरित्र भी प्रकाशित हुआ है इसके अतिरिक्त आपका जीवन चरित्र सुधा में छपा है। पूर्ण रूपेण आपका विस्तृत जीवन चरित्र पुस्तकाकार में प्रकाशित करने का भी विचार है।

 वि० सं० १९९६ भाद्रपद शुक्ला १५ को केवल दो तीन दिन ही अस्वस्थ रहकर गुरुवर पंडितजी का अचानक स्वर्गवास हो गया। स्थानीय सिविल सर्जन का कथन था कि यह दिमागी उत्कट परिश्रम का श्राघात हृदय पर हुआ।

 पंडितजी के परिवार में आपके सहोदर भाई भतीजे कोई भी न थे, आपकी धर्मपत्नी का स्वर्गवास वि० सं० १९६२ में ही हो चुका था और फिर आपने विवाह नहीं किया। केवल एक मात्र पुत्र पंडित प्रशुनजी उन दिनों अलवर नरेश के पास थे जिन्हें आपके अस्वस्थ होते ही तार द्वारा बुला लिया गया था। पंडितजी ने अपने अन्तिम समय में स्वरचित ग्रन्थों के प्रकाशित की एक मात्र इच्छा अपने पुत्र से प्रकट की जिसके लिए आपके सुपुत्र ने दृढ़ प्रतिज्ञा की।

 उस दिन सम्पूर्ण नगर में शोक छाया हुआ था। राजकीय उच्च कर्मचारियों व राज के लवाजमा के साथ आपका शब विमान श्मशान पहुँचाया गया, वहाँ शव को स्नान कराकर विभूति तिलक धारण कर जो सूर्याभिमुख बैठाया गया तो मुख पर विज्ञान ज्योति का अद्भुत दर्शन

हुआ कि सब लोग आश्चर्य चकित हो प्रणाम करने लगे। यह वैदिकविज्ञान का प्रत्यक्ष चमत्कार था। आपका उत्तर क्रिया श्राद्धादिक शास्त्रीय विधि विधान तथा राज्य के सम्मान के अनुसार आप के सुपुत्र ने बड़ी श्रद्धा से किया। मासिक तयाह में ब्राह्मण भोजनादिक होते रह कर वार्षिक श्राद्ध के अनन्तरही पितृपक्ष में पं० प्रद्युम्नजी ने गयाश्राद्ध भी सविधि सम्पन्न कर डाला।

 पंडितजी के स्वर्गारोहण के अवसर पर समाचारपत्रों में “वैदिकविज्ञान का सूर्य अस्त यह हैडिङ्ग निकला था। अलवर दरभंगा आदि कई नरेशों तथा महामना पं० मदनमोहनजी मालवीय, प्रयाग के वाइस चांसलर डा० गङ्गानाथ झा आदि अनेक गण्य मान्य व्यक्तियों के सम वेदना सूचक बहुत से तार व पत्र आये थे और बहुत स्थानों में शोक सभाएँ हुई। जयपुर में भी रायबहादुर पं० अमरनाथजी अटल एम० ए०, फाइनेन्स मिनिस्टर के सभापतित्व में महाराजाज संसकृत कालेज में बड़े बड़े सरदारों उच्च कर्मचारियों विद्वानों तथा गएय मान्य पुरवासियों की उपस्थिति में एक विराट् शोक सभा की गई।

 पंडितजी महाराज के पुत्र पण्डित प्रद्युम्नजी ओझा का बाल्यकाल से अपने पूज्य पिताजी के पास ही अधिकांश रहन सहन व पठन पाठन का प्रबन्ध रहा था, यह अपने पिता के इकलौते पुत्र थे अतः इनका लालन पालन भी अत्यधिक प्यार से होता था। आपकी शिक्षा संस्कृत हिन्दी तथा अंग्रेजी में हुई। यह भी अपने पिता के साथ स्वर्गीय जयपुर नरेश महाराज माधवसिंहजी के समीप जाया करते थे और महाराज भी इनको छोटे पण्डितजी के नाम से सम्बोधित कर बड़ा वात्सल्य प्रकट किया करते थे। ये बाल्यकाल से ही बड़े बुद्धिमान् और चंचल प्रकृति के हैं। इनकी बुद्धिमत्ता से प्रसन्न होकर महाराजाधिराज ने इन्हें अपने पास आने जाने के लिये स्वतन्त्र आज्ञा प्रदान कर रक्खी थी और इनके लिये भी अपने खासा अस्तबल से सवारी के लिये घोड़ा अलग नियुक्त कर दियाथा साथ ही जहाँ कहीं भी महाराज विदेश पधारते वहाँ आपके पूज्य पिताजी तो साथ होते ही थे ये भी महाराज की आज्ञानुसार बहुतसी यात्राओं में साथ रहा करते थे। जब यह कुछ बड़े हुये तो पंडितजी के स्वदेश आदि जाने पर या अस्वस्थ होने पर महाराज इन्हीं को पुस्तकशाला मौजमन्दिर (धर्मसभा) आदि कार्यों पर पंडितजी के स्थानापन्न नियुक्तकर कार्यं लिया करते थे और उस समय के प्रधान मंत्री स्व० बाबू संसारचन्द्रसेनजी, सी० आई० ई० तथा स्व० नब्बाब मुम्ताजु- होला सर फैयाज अली खाँजी, के ०सी० आई० ई०, एम्० वी० ओ० और राय बहादुर पुरोहित स्व० सर गोपीनाथजी, सी० आई० ई० इनके कार्य से परम संतुष्ट तथा प्रसन्न रहते थे इस प्रकार इनने पूर्ण नीतिकुशलता और समाचातुरी प्राप्त करली और महाराज के कृपापात्र बन गये।

 जब स्वर्गीय दरभंगा नरेश श्रीमान् श्री १०८ रमेश्वरसिंहजी जयपुर पधारे थे तो भूतपूर्व जयपुर नरेश ने इन्हीं पं० प्रद्युम्नजी ओझाको उनके आतिथ्य सत्कार पर प्रमुख नियुक्त किया था उस समय दरभंगा नरेश इनके प्रबन्ध से बहुत प्रसन्न हुए थे और तब से वह इनको विशेष प्रेम और

कृपा की दृष्टि से देखने लगे। वर्त्तमान दरभंगा नरेश श्रीमान् महाराजाधिराज श्री १०८ श्री कामेश्वर सिंहजी भी इनपर उसी प्रकार पूर्ण कृपा रखते हैं और इस प्रन्थ प्रकाशन कार्य में उन की भी सहानुभूति रहती है।

 कुछ समय पं० प्रद्युम्नजी को अपनी संपत्ति के प्रबंन्ध के लिये स्वदेश जाकर भी रहना पड़ा था वहाँ उच्च यूरोपियन आई० सी० एस० आफिसर ने इनकी नीति निपुणता देख कर एक इलाके का इन्हें प्रेसीडेन्ट नियुक्त कर दिया जिसमें दीवानी तथा फौजदारी विभाग का कार्य इन्होने कई वर्ष तक बड़े न्याय निपुणता से किया जिससे पबलिक बड़ी परितुष्ट रही और उस अरसे में जो जो यूरोपियन आफिसर बदल कर आये वे सभी इनके कार्य से परम संतुष्ट रहे और इसके लिये उन्होंने लिखित प्रमाण पत्र भी इन्हें दिये हैं साथ ही जब वहाँ बहुत से लाईसेन्स प्राप्त लोगों से भी लाईसैन्स वापस लिया जाकर कमो की जा रही थी उस समय इनको सम्पूर्ण भारतवर्ष के लिये दुनाली अँग्रेजी बन्दूक का लाईसैन्स देकर बिहार गवर्नमेन्ट ने इन्हें राजभक्त रूप से सम्मानित किया था।

 पं० प्रद्युम्नजी अपने पिता के समक्ष वर्त्तमान श्रीमान् अलवर महाराज श्री १०८ श्री तेजसिंहनी के राज्य सिंहासनारोहण के अवसर से ही उनके बड़े कृपापात्र तथा पूर्ण विश्वास पात्र होकर उनके आत्मीय परिजनों में सम्मानित हुए और उनके पास ही रहा करते थे। वे धार्मिक सभी कार्य इनके परामर्शानुसार करते और समय समय पर अन्य विषयों पर भी परामर्श लिया करते थे, साथ ही शस्त्र तथा अश्व के कार्यों में भी सुयोग्य होने के कारण इन्हें महाराज ने अपना ए. डी. सी. नियुक्त कर आखेट (शिकार) आदि में भी अपने साथ रखते थे।

 पिता के अस्वस्थ होते ही पं० प्रद्युम्नजी को जयपुर आ जाना पड़ा। वर्तमान श्रीमान् महाराजा जयपुर ने इनके पिताजी को जीविका इनको यथावत् प्रदान करदी।

 श्रीमान् महाराज अलवर को पण्डितजी में पूर्ण भक्ति और उनके पुत्र पं० प्रयुनजी पर पूर्ववत् अतुल कृपा है और श्रीमान् पण्डितजी की इन महान् कृतियों से पूर्ण परिचित हैं अतः श्रीमान् का इस ग्रन्थ प्रकाशन कार्य में पूर्ण सहयोग है।

 पं० प्रद्युम्नजी ने अपने पिता के अन्तिम इच्छा ग्रन्थ प्रकाशन की उनके समक्ष प्रतिज्ञा कर उन्हें परितुष्ट किया था उस प्रतिज्ञा के अनुसार इस कार्य में प्राणपण से जुटे हुए हैं।

 इन तीन वर्षों में अपने ६-७ ग्रन्थ प्रकाशित कर डाले हैं और कई विभिन्न प्रेसों में मुद्रणार्थ दिये जा चुके हैं, साथ ही आगे कार्य क्रम जारी कर रक्खा है

 जो कुछ सम्पत्ति पुज्य पण्डितजी ने छोड़ी है उसे ये एकमात्र प्रन्थ प्रकाशन में हीं लगा रहे हैं, और वो क्या आपका यहाँ तक संकल्प है कि यदि द्रव्य का अभाव होगा तो मकान आदि बेच कर इस कार्यं को यथा सम्भव सम्पन्न करेंगे। किन्तु प्रश्न यह है कि क्या देश में गुणग्राहकता का इतना अभाव हो गया है कि वह ऐसा होने देगा ? इसका उत्तर भविष्य देगा।

**अन्नाद्भवन्ति भूतानि पर्जन्यादन्न संभवः।  
यज्ञाद्भवति पर्जन्यो, यज्ञः कर्म समुद्भवः ॥**

 अन्न से भूत-प्राणियों का जीवन रहता है, अन्न पर्जन्य से पैदा होता है, और पर्जन्य यज्ञ से उत्पन्न होता है, तथा यह यज्ञ कर्म से समुद्भूत है। इति।

 इस सिद्धान्त से यही सिद्ध होता है कि कर्म समुद्भूत यज्ञही अन्न जल आदिका और प्राणियों के जीवन का हेतु है। यज्ञ की इसी शक्ति को लक्ष्य में रखकर यह भी कहा गया है कि—

**“सहयज्ञाः प्रजाः सृष्ट्वा पुरोवाच प्रजापतिः।  
अनेन प्रसविष्यध्व मेष वोऽस्त्विष्ट कामधुक्”॥ इति ॥**

**तथा– “सर्वेषां देवानामात्मायद्यज्ञः”इत्यादि (श० ब्रा० १४।३।१)**

 यह यज्ञ क्या वस्तु है जिस से सभी की मनोवृत्ति की पूर्ति होती है। आजकल इस के विषय में भिन्न-भिन्न मतानुयायियोंने भिन्न-भिन्न प्रकार से सिद्धान्त स्थिर कर रक्खे हैं। इसी लिए इसकी वैज्ञानिक उपपत्ति न जानकर और भिन्न-भिन्न सिद्धान्त सुनकर भोलीभाला साधारण जनता इसका तिरस्कार करने का सहसा साहस कर बैठती है, और अपनी ही त्रुटि से अपने उद्देश्यों की पूर्ति नहीं कर सकती।

 आज हम यहां पर्जन्य के विषय में कुछ लिखते हुए प्रसंगागत इस यज्ञ के विषय पर वैज्ञानिक दृष्टि से यह प्रतिपादन करते हुए कि यज्ञ से जनमनोवृत्ति की पूर्ति कैसे होती है, और वह क्या वस्तु है तथा आगे क्रमशः वर्षा का यज्ञ के साथ संबन्ध, आप् (जल) की याज्ञिकता और उत्पत्ति एवं स्वरूप अर्थात् जल कहाँ से, किस रूप से कब कैसे पैदा होता है, और पृथ्वी पर कैसे

आता है, तथा इसके आने के कौन-कौन से निमित्त हैं और वे कैसे जाने जा सकते हैं–इत्यादि विषयों का दिग्दर्शन पाठकों के आगे संक्षेप में रखते हैं।

 वास्तवमें “अग्नौसोमा हुतिर्यज्ञः” इस वैदिक परिभाषानुसार अनि में सोम की आहुति डालनेही को यज्ञ कहते हैं। यद्यपि भिन्न-भिन्न शास्त्रकारों ने “अन्नोर्क प्राणानामन्योन्य परिग्रहो यज्ञः”, “वाचश्चित्तस्योत्तरोत्तरि क्रमो यज्ञः”–इत्यादि भिन्न-भिन्न प्रकार से अपने–अपने प्रन्थों में यज्ञ की परिभाषायें लिखी हैं, किन्तु उन सब का समन्वय हमारी पूर्वोक परिभाषा में सुसंगत हो जाता है; क्योंकि अध्यात्म, अधिभूत और अधिदैवत इन तीनों ही जगह अग्नि में सोम बहुत होता रहता है और इन तीनों से पृथक् कोई वस्तु शेष नहीं रह जाती।

 पृथ्वी पिएड से २१ वें अहर्गणपर, जो कि लगभग ९ करोड़ मील की दूरीपर है, “वृहद्धतस्थौ भुवनेष्वन्तः” इस श्रुति के अनुसार सूर्य स्थित है। यह सूर्य अग्निस्थ है। इसके चारों ओर सोम समुद्र है, जिसे कि वेद में पारमेष्ठ्यमंडल कहा गया है। उस अग्निमय सूर्य में उस का स्वरूप रक्षक यह परिमेष्ठ्य सोम अनवरत आहुत होता रहता है। इसी से सूर्य को 'अग्निहोत्र' कहा गया है, और उसके प्रकाशमंडल (Solar system) को ‘संवत्सरयज्ञ’ कहते हैं। समित्येकीभावे। सम्=एकत्र वसन् सरतीति संवत्सरः। अथवा “त्सरउमगतो”। सर्वत्रत्सरतीति संवत्सरः। सप्तदशौ वै संवत्सरः। यानी १७ स्तोम को व्यासमान कर जो एक वृत्त खींचा जाय वह संवत्सरवृत्त कहलाता है। इसी संवत्सर रूप अधिदैवत यज्ञ में ‘अधि’ की न्यूनाधिकता से ऋतु परिवर्तन होता है जिस से चातुर्मास्य कहते हैं। यह हुआ आधिदेवतयज्ञ।

 हम जो प्रतिदिन सायंप्रातः अपनी शारीराग्नि में अन्नमय सोम की आहुति देते हैं इसको अध्यात्म यश कहते हैं। संसार का प्रत्येक भौतिक पदार्थ अग्निमय है और वह भी सर्वत्र व्याप्त ‘ऋत्’ सोम को आहुति लेकर ही अपने स्वरूप में प्रतिष्ठित हो रहा है जब तक यज्ञ है, तभीतक इन तीनों की सत्ता है। उक्त सौर यज्ञ के कारण ही सौर प्राणदेवता मर्त्यत्व से विमुक्त होकर अमृतत्व को पहुँच जाता है, जैसाकि श्रुति कहती है—

**“सत्रस्य ऋद्धिरस्यगन्म ज्योतिरमृता अभूम।  
दिवं पृथिव्या अध्यारुहामा विदामदेवान् स्वर्ज्योतिः”॥ इति॥**

 हमारा आध्यात्मिक यज्ञ पार्थिव प्राण की प्रधानता से मर्त्यभावानुगृहीत है। चाध्यात्मिक प्राणदेवताओं को उसी वैधयज्ञ के द्वारा आधिदैविक प्राणदेवताओं के साथ युक्त कर अमृत

भाव को प्राप्त करलेना ही कर्मप्रधान भौतिक यज्ञ का फल है। इसी कारण से मनुष्यों की मनोवृत्ति की पूर्ति यज्ञ द्वारा हुआ करती है।

 अब हमें बताना यह है कि अग्नि और सोम कहते किसे हैं। वेद में दो तरह के पदार्थ माने हैं–ऋत् और सत्य। इनमें अग्नि सत्य पदार्थ है और सोम ऋतू पदार्थ है। सहृदय और सशरीर पदार्थ सत्य है और हृदय शून्यपदार्थ ऋत है। संसार में जितने पिण्ड हैं उनके एक प्रकार का केन्द्र (Centre) होता है, अतः ये सब सत्य पदार्थों हैं और इन का मूल कारण अभि है, सोम द्रव पदार्थ है इसके कोई केन्द्र नहीं होता। यही सोम जब अग्निसात् होजाता है तब अमि पिण्ड रूपमें परिणत हो जाता है। अर्थात् यह समझना चाहिए कि सोमगर्भित अग्नि ही पिण्डरूप है। पृथ्वी भी एक पिण्ड है और पिण्ड अग्नि का बनता है, अतएव यास्काचार्य लिखते हैं–“अग्निः पृथ्वीस्थानः” (निरू० दैवत कां० ७।५।२) इति। जिस पदार्थ पिण्डको साधारण जनसमूह दृश्य समझता है, वह वास्तव में अदृश्य है। उसका तो केवल हमें स्पर्श होता है, प्रत्यक्षी करण तो एकमात्र उस वस्तु के वेदमय रश्मिमंडल ही का होता है। इस का विवेचन हमारे 'वेद समीक्षा' नामक ग्रंथ में देखना चाहिए। यहां पर इतना ही हमें बताना है कि पिण्डसे निकल ने वाली किरणें अपने नियत देश से हटती नहीं। उदाहरणार्थ किसी वस्तु पिण्ड को सामने रख लीजिए। जैसे- सामने एक पुस्तक रक्खी हुई है, उससे चारों ओर अनन्त वेदमय किरणें-जिनका स्पर्श हमारी आंखें करती हैं- निकल रही हैं। सब का प्रदेश नियत है। यदि हम किसी भी तरक्क उन किरणों के रोकने के लिए कुछ भी अवरोधक वस्तु रखदेंगे तो उस तरफ जाती हुई वे किरणें उस अवरोधक वस्तु से टकरा कर प्रतिफलित होती हुई, उसी नियत देश से जिस से वह जा रहीं थी, वापस लौट आयेंगी किन्तु इधर उधर विरुद्ध मार्ग का अनुगमन कदापि नहीं करेंगी। इस से यह होगा कि उधर की तरफ़ बैठा हुआ व्यक्ति उस वस्तु को किरणों के वापस लौट जाने के कारण नहीं देख सकेगा। बस, इसी नियत भाव के कारण अग्नि को सत्य कहते हैं।

 सोम इस अग्नि से विरुद्ध अवस्था वाला ऋत है। पानी, वायु और सोम ये तीनों एक जाति की वस्तु हैं। घनावस्थाका सोम 'पानी' कहलाता है, तरलावस्था वाला वायु' और विरलावस्था वाला “सोम” ‘सोम’ ही कहलाता है। सोम और वायु को हम आंख से देख नहीं सकते। इसका एक मात्र कारण इन में अत्रिप्राण का प्रभाव होना है। अत्रिप्राण की विवेचना हमारे 'ऋषिरहस्य' और 'अत्रिख्याति' नामक ग्रंथों में देखनी चाहिए। अत्रि प्राण की अधिकमात्रा होने के कारण हम पानी में–जोकि एक प्रकार से सोम ही है–ऋतभाव को देख सकते हैं। जैसे–जब बहता हुआ कहीं जा रहा है, उस बहते हुए जल के आगे यदि कुछ अवरोध के लिये

पत्थर वगैरह रखदिया जाय तो वह जल उपर्युक्त उस पुस्तक की किरणों की तरह उससे टकराकर वापस नहीं लौटेगा, प्रत्युत उस पत्थर के इधर उधर हो कर आगे निकल आवेगा। कारण यही है कि आग्नेय पिण्डों की तरह जल का कोई केन्द्र नहीं, यह हृदय शून्य है केन्द्र के न होने से ही पानी तथा वायु और सोम में सत्यस्व उत्पन्न नहीं होता है। इस उदाहरण से पाठकों को यह विदित हो गया होगा कि अग्नि सत्य है और सोम ऋत है। “अग्नीषोमात्मकं जगत्” इस श्रुति वाक्यानुसार संसार अग्नि और सोम मय है और अग्नि में सोमके आहुत होने को यज्ञ कहते हैं।

 पाठक-वृन्द अथ समझगये होंगे कि यज्ञ किसे कहते हैं, इसका विशद विवेचन अस्मद्रचित “यज्ञमधुसूदन” में किया गया है।

 प्रकृत में अब हमें यहाँ इसयज्ञ से पानी की उत्पत्ति बतानी है। सोम की अवस्था विशेष का नाम ही पानी है। इस पानी की उत्पत्ति बताने के लिए वैदिक सृष्टि प्रकरण का कुछ अंश निरूपण करना आवश्यक है।  

**“प्रजापतिस्त्वेवेदं सर्वमसृजत, यदिदं किञ्च”। (शत० प्रा० ६।१।११)**

**“प्रजापतिर्वा इदमग्र आसीदेक एव ”(६।१।३।१) इत्यादि।**

 श्रुति सूक्तियों से सिद्ध होता है कि समस्त विश्व को प्रजापतिने बनाया है। इस प्रजापति के दो भाग हैं— मर्त्य और अमृत जैसाकि लिखा है—

**“तस्य ह प्रजापतेः अर्धमेव मर्त्यमासी दर्धममृतम्” (श. प्रा. १०।२।२)  
तथा “उभयं हैतदग्रे प्रजापतिरास, मर्त्य चैवामृतंच” (१०।१।४)**

 इन दोनों में से मर्त्यभाग विश्व है और अमृतभाग सत्य है अर्थात् सत्य और यज्ञ भेद से दो तरह का प्रजापति होता है उस में यज्ञ प्रजापति द्वारा यज्ञाधार सत्य प्रजापति का ही वितान होता है। यह बात—**“यज्ञंकृत्वा सत्यं तनवामहै”**—इस श्रुति वाक्य से सिद्ध होती है। इसी सत्यात्मा को षोडशी पुरुष कहते हैं। अव्यय, अक्षर और क्षर की पांच-पांच कलायें तथा एक परात्पर इन्हीं १६ की समष्टि को षोडशी पुरुष कहते हैं। इनमें ज्ञान स्वरूप अव्यय संसार का आलम्बन, कर्मस्वरूप अक्षर निमित्त कारण और अर्थस्वरूप क्षर उपादान कारण है, परात्पर इन तीनों से परे है। पर अव्यय को कहते हैं, यह पर से भी परे है अतः इसे “परात्पर” कहते हैं, हम यहां जल की उत्पत्ति बताने के लिये केवल तर आत्मा का ही विवेचन करते हैं।

पुराणों में “ब्रह्मा” शब्द इसी तर के लिये प्रयुक्त हुआ है। इसकी प्राण आप्, वाक्, अन्न और अन्नाद ये पांच कलायें विश्वसृड ब्रह्म के नाम से कहलाती हैं। येही कलायें ब्रह्मा के पाँच मुख हैं। इनमें अनाद अमि है और अन्न सोम है। सोम के अभिसत् होजाने से ब्रह्मा चतुर्मुख ही बन जाता है। वेद में अभि को रुद्र नाम से भी कहा है–“रुद्रो वा एष यदग्निः” इति। रुद्र के द्वारा ब्रह्मा के शिरश्छेद वाली पौराणिक गाथा इसी उक्त विज्ञान के आधार पर रची हुई है। अस्तु। ब्रह्मा की इन पांचों कलाओं का पंचीकरण होता है। अर्थात् पांचों पांचों में बहुत हो जाती हैं। इन पंचीकृत प्रारण, आपू, वाक्, अन्न और अन्नाद क्षरों को पंचजन कहते हैं। ये पांचों (पंचजन) पांचों में पांचोंकी आहुति होने से पैदा होते हैं अतः इसे सर्वहुत यज्ञ भी कहते हैं। इन पंचजनों का पुनः परस्पर यज्ञ होता है। इस यज्ञ से पांच पुरंजन पैदा होते हैं। इसी को लक्ष्य में रखकर कहा गया है–“यज्ञेन यज्ञमयजन्तदेवाः” (यजुः) इति। ये उत्पन्न हुए पांच पुरंजन -स्वयंभू, परमेष्ठी, सूर्य, चन्द्रमा, पृथ्वी- इन नामों से कहलाते हैं इनमें स्वयंभू प्राणमय, परमेष्ठी आपोमय, सूर्यवाङ्मय, चन्द्रमा अन्नमय और पृथ्वी अन्नादमयी है लोकसृष्टि होती है, वाङ्मय सूर्य से प्राणमय स्वयंभू से वेदसृष्टि होती है, आपोमय परमेष्ठी से देवसृष्टि और अन्न–अन्नादमय चन्द्र–पृथ्वी से भूतसृष्टि होती है। स्वयंभू की वेदसृष्टि प्राणसृष्टि कहलाती है और इसेही–ईश्वर की मोमसी सृष्टि कहते हैं। स्वयंभू मंडल में वेदत्रवी (ऋक्, यजुः, साम) की सत्ता है। इसमें यजु के यत् भाग को प्राण कहते हैं और जू भाग को वाकू। ये दोनों अन्तरिक्ष वायु के नाम से वेद में प्रसिद्ध हैं, और इन दोनों में एक के बिना एक नहीं रह सकता। प्रतिसंचर क्रम में ये अन्तरिक्षवायु शेष रह जाते हैं और ये– प्राण, वाक्, मन के बिना सर्वथा अनुपपन्न है। मन की इच्छा से अन्तरिक्षालम्बन पर ब्रह्माभिरूप वायु में क्षोभ उत्पन्न होता है और क्षोभ के कारण उस समय वायु में स्वत एव घर्षण होने लगता है। इस घर्षण होने के कारण उस प्राणाग्नि से पानी पैदा होजाता है। अथवा यों समझिए कि वह प्राणाग्नि पानी के स्वरूप में बदल जाता है। अग्नि के कारण ही पानी का संघात और विलयन होता है— इस बात को दार्शनिक भी मानते हैं। जैसे— "अपां संघातो विलयनं च तेजः संयोगात्" (वैशेषि) इति। वेद में भी "अग्नेरापः" इसीलिये कहा है। अस्तु। हमें यहां बताना यही था कि स्वयंभू के ब्रह्माग्नि रूप प्राण से सर्व प्रथम पानी की सृष्टि होती है। इसी सृष्टि विज्ञान को लक्ष्य में रखकर मनुभगवान कहते हैं-

**“सोऽभिध्याय शरीरात् स्वात् सिसृक्षुर्विविधाः प्रजाः।  
अप एव ससर्जादौ तासु बीज भवा सृजत्”॥ इति॥**

**(मनुस्मृ० १।८)**

 हम पहले कह चुके हैं कि स्वयंभू की सृष्टि मानसी सृष्टि है; किन्तु उससे जब यह पानी की सृष्टि विजातीय प्राणों के संगम से पैदा होने के कारण मैथुनी सृष्टि कहलाने लग गई। प्राण मय स्वयंभू से पैदा होने वाले इस आपोमयमंडल को “परमेष्ठी” कहते हैं। यह मंडल जिसे कि कहीं पर सरस्वान् समुद्र के नाम से भी कहा है, स्वयंभू से नीचे है और इससे अब आगे सूर्याण्ड (ब्रह्माण्ड) की उत्पत्ति होती है। यह आपोमयमण्डल सूर्याण्ड से परम स्थान में है, अतः इसे परमेष्ठी कहते हैं। आप् की उत्पत्ति एवं निरुक्ति बताती हुई श्रुति इस प्रकार उपर्युक्त प्रकरण की पुष्टि करती है।

**“आपो ह वा इदमग्रे सलिलमेवास। ता अकामयन्त कथं नु प्रजाये महीति।

 परमेष्ठी के इस पानी को–जिसे हम पीते हैं–वह पानी नहीं समझना चाहिये। परमेष्ठी के इस पानी को प्रारम्भ में बताया हुआ ऋत तत्वही समझना चाहिये। यह ऋत तब इस मंडल का मनोता है। भृगु, अंगिरा और अत्रि–यही इसका स्वरूप है। इनमें भृगु की जो घन,

तरल और विरल ये ३ अवस्थायें हैं, इन्हीं को क्रमसे आप्, वायु और सोम कहते हैं। इसीलिये कहा भी है—

**“आपो भृग्वङ्गिरो रूपमापो भृग्वङ्गिरो मयम्।  
अन्तरेते त्रयो वेदा भृगूनङ्गिरसः श्रिताः”।**

**तथा**—**“तृतीयस्यां वै दिवि सोम आसीत्"।  
तथा**—**“ऋतमेव परमेष्ठी, ऋतं नात्येति कश्चन।**  
**      ऋते समुद्र हित, ऋते भूमिरियं श्रिता”॥इति ॥**

 उपर्युक्त आप्-वायु-सोम में जो आप् है वह भी वायु रूप ही है। केवल आप् (पीने के जल) के आरंभक होने के कारण इसे आप कह दिया गया है। असल में सूर्य मण्डल से ऊपर बाले इस आप को “अंभः” कहते हैं और पीनेवाले जल को ‘मर’ कहते हैं। पुराणों में सूर्यमण्डल ब्रह्माण्ड नाम से कहा गया है। यह अंभः पानी परमेष्ठि मण्डल से ब्रह्माण्ड का भेदन करके इस पृथ्वीलोक में आता है। परमेष्ठिलोक, विष्णुलोक कहलाता है। बस, यही विज्ञान गो- हम का मूल समझना चाहिये। इसका विशद विवेचन हमारे अन्य ग्रंथों में देखना चाहिये। गंगाजल में यही अंभः पानी है। यद्यपि इसका संपर्क सभी पानियों में है, किन्तु गंगाजल में सब से अधिक मात्रा में है और गंगाजल का साक्षात् संबन्ध इसी पारमेष्ठथ अंभः सोम से है। इस अंभः पानी के और इस परमेष्ठी लोक के पवमान नामक वायु के मेल से यह मर नामक स्थूल पानी (पीने का पानी) बनता है। इन्हीं को आज कल पाश्चात्य विज्ञान में हाइड्रोजन (Hydrogen) और आक्सीजन (Oxygen) कहते हैं। प्रकृति के अनुसार यह सर्व प्रथम स्वतः इस परमेष्ठिलोक से इससे नीचे वाले सूर्यलोक में जाता है और सूर्याएड (ब्रह्माण्ड) का भेदन करके सीधा पृथ्वीलोक की तरफ आने के लिए सूर्य किरणों में प्रतिष्ठित होजाता है। सूर्य आग्नेय होने के कारण इस आये हुये विजातीय पानी को अपनी उष्णरश्मियों से धक्का देकर फेंक देता है। उत्तर में सोममय चन्द्रमा है और दक्षिण में यमानि है, अत एव यह पानी दक्षिण में न जाकर सजातीय आकर्षण के कारण उत्तर में चन्द्रमंडल में ठहर जाता है और फिर यहाँ से चान्द्ररश्मियों से चूकर भूलोक में अवतीर्ण होता है। भूलोक में आया हुआ यह पानी प्रति संचर क्रम से फिर सूर्यरश्मियों द्वारा भाप के रूप में उड़ाया जाकर ऊपर आकाश में सूर्य किरणों के अन्दर प्रतिष्ठित होजाता है और फिर यह पानी आठ मास तक वहां रहकर तथा आकाश वायु से इतस्ततः दिशा-

ओं में फैलाया जाकर समय समय पर भिन्न भिन्न स्थानों में कई निमित्तों से अल्प और अधिक मात्रा में पृथ्वी पर बरस जाता है। इसीलिये उपर्युक्त क्रम को लक्ष्य में रखकर यह कहा गया है–

**“अग्नौ प्रास्ताहुतिः सम्यगादित्यमुपतिष्ठते।  
आदित्याज्जायते वृष्टि र्वृष्टेरन्नं ततः प्रजाः”॥इति ॥**

तैत्तिरीय संहिता में भी इसी विज्ञान के उद्देश्य से यह कहा गया है—

**“अग्निर्वा इतो वृष्टिसुदीरयति मरुतः सृष्टां नयन्ति।  
यदा खलु वा असावादित्योन्यङ्रश्मिभिः पर्यावर्त्तते अथ वर्षति”।**

 (तै० सं० २।४।१०)। इति।

 इसी वर्षा के जानने के लिये निमित्त ज्ञान की आवश्यकता होती है। संसार में निमित्त के सहारे से ही सब कार्य होते रहते हैं। यदि सूक्ष्म दृष्टि से देखा जाय तो प्रतीत होगा कि कोई भी घटना बिना किसी निमित्त के नहीं होती है। उसका कोई न कोई निमित्त अवश्य ही होता है। घटना के निमित्त की पहले से ही यदि ज्ञान रहे तो मनुष्य निमित्त के उपस्थित होने पर घटना से लाभ उठाने के लिए सन्नद्ध हो सकता है। निमित्त ज्ञान के आधार पर ही कर्त्तव्याकर्त्तव्य रूप ज्ञान के बोधक धर्म्म शास्त्र की भी उपपत्ति है । सर्व शास्त्रों का आधार भूत यह शास्त्र सब में प्रधान है।

 व्यवहार के विविध विषयों के विविध निमित्तों के सम्बन्ध से निमित्त शास्त्र विविध प्रकार का है। एक प्रकरण ऐसा भी है, जिसमें अन्नों का परस्पर सम्बन्ध प्रतिपादित किया गयाहै। इस प्रकरण का ज्ञाता-व्यक्ति एक नियत क्षेत्र में और नियतकाल में अन्न विशेष की उत्पत्ति करके कह सकता है कि विविध प्रकार की भूमियों में भिन्न भिन्न प्रकार के अन्न कितनी कितनी मात्रा में बोये गये हैं और ये कितनो कितनी मात्रा में अन्न की प्राप्ति करायेंगे। यह प्रकरण अन्न विद्याबोधक निमित्त शास्त्र है। इस प्रकार भिन्न भिन्न निमित्त शास्त्र ६४ प्रकरणों में विभक्त हैं। इन निमित्त शास्त्रों में वृष्टि के निमित्तों का बोध कराने वाला एक “वृष्टि विद्या बोधक निमित्त शास्त्र” भी है। हम पहिले कह आये हैं कि सूर्य अपनी किरणों द्वारा पृथ्वी पर से जल को ऊपर खींच लेता है. अर्थात् सूर्य की गरमी से जल के परमाणु सूक्ष्म बनकर ऊँचे चले आते हैं और उन के साथ आकाश वायु के परमाणु आदि मिलकर बादल बन जाते हैं फिर वे बादल वायु की प्रेरणा से जिस जिस देश में तथा जिस जिस काल में जितना जितना जन बरसना होता है उतना उतना वहाँ बसरते हैं । परन्तु किस समय का खींचा हुआ जल कितने समय के पीछे कितने दिन तक कितना

किस समय कहाँ कहाँ बरसेगा— इत्यादि बातों का बतानेवाला यह ऊपर कहा हुआ “वृष्टिविद्या बोधक निमित्तशास्त्र” है।

 इस शास्त्र में वर्षा के निमित्त–भौम,आन्तरिक्ष,दिव्य और मिश्र–इन ४ भेदों में विभक्त हैं—

 १–देश, मनुष्य, पशु, पक्षी, कीट, पतंग प्रभूति भौतिक चीजों के द्वारा वर्षा के ज्ञान होने को भौतिकनिमित्त कहते हैं।

 २–वायु, बादल, विद्युत्, गर्जन, तर्जन, सन्ध्या दिग्दाह, प्रतिसूर्य, तारा, कुण्डल, आँधी, गन्धर्वनगर, इन्द्रधनुष, वायुधारणा आदि से वर्षा के ज्ञान होने को अन्तरिक्षनिमित्त कहते हैं।

 ३–सूर्य-चन्द्रग्रहण, पुच्छलतारे, सूर्य के चिन्ह, सप्तनादीचक्र, ग्रहों का उदयास्त संक्रान्ति आदि से वृष्टि के ज्ञान प्राप्त करने को दिव्यनिमित्त कहते हैं।

 ४–कार्तिक से आश्विन तक के बारह महीनों के प्रत्येक दिनों के तथा विशेष रूप से खास-खास अक्षयतृतीया, आषाढ़ीपूर्णिमा, होलिका आदि के शकुनों तथा उपर्युक्त चिन्हों से वर्षा के ज्ञान करने को मिश्रनिमित्त कहते हैं।

 इन निमित्तों में भौमनिमित्त की अपेक्षा अन्तरिक्षनिमित्त, और अन्तरिक्ष की अपेक्षा दिव्यनिमित्त-इस तरह उत्तरोत्तर एक दूसरे से अधिक बलवान है। क्योंकि भौमनिमित्त का फल बहुधा थोडीही दूरतक, अन्तरिक्ष का फल एक जिलेतक, दिव्यनिमित्त का फल एक प्रान्ततक और मिश्रनिमित्त का फल सर्वत्र होता है। इनमें प्रायः भौमनिमित्तों से सद्योवृष्टि का ज्ञान हो जाता है।

 इन चारों निमित्तों के लिए— विशेष कर दिव्य और मिश्रनिमित्तों की परीक्षा के लिए सर्वप्रथम खगोलीय ग्रहनक्षत्र स्थिति जानना परमावश्यक है। इसके ज्ञान बिना सहसा कोई निमित्त निश्चित कर लेना दुष्कर है। अतः पाठकों के आगे खगोलविद्या के संबन्ध में कुछ ग्रहनक्षत्रस्थिति का दिग्दर्शन करादेना अप्रासंगिक न होगा।

 वेदशास्त्र में पृथ्वी का घूमना और पृथ्वी की अपेक्षा सूर्य का स्थिर रहना मानागया है। इस विषय का विशेष विवेचन अस्मद्रचित “अहोरात्रवाद” में देखना चाहिये। यह पृथ्वी जिस अपने निश्चित मार्ग पर सूर्य के चारों ओर चक्कर लगाती है, उसे “क्रान्तिवृत्त” कहते हैं। अर्थात् यह पृथ्वीपिण्ड सूर्य को केन्द्र बनाकर जिस वृत्त पर चारों ओर चक्कर लगाता है, वह “क्रान्तिवृत्त” कहलाता है। परिभ्रमणवृत्त के बीचों बीच एक रेखा की कल्पना की गई है, जिसे वेद में “बृहति

(वृत)” छन्द और ज्यौतिष में विषुवद्वृत्त, तथा अंग्रेजी में इक्वेटरलाइन (Equator line) कहते हैं। सूर्य इसी विषुववृत्त के, जिसे बृहतीवृत्त भी कहते हैं, मध्यमें तपता है। अतएव वेद में यह कहा गया है।

**“सूर्यो बृहतिमध्यूढस्तपति” तथा “स वा एष संवत्सरो  
बृहतिमभिसंपन्नः” (शत० १२। १७। १)**

 यहां इस सूर्य में कितना प्रचंड उष्णत्व है; इसका अनुमान करना भी दुरूह है। सूर्य से आई हुई उष्णता का पृथ्वी पर लगभग चारखरबव अंश है। आधुनिक वैज्ञानिकों का मत है कि सौरजगत् में जितनी उष्णता फेंकी जाती है, उसका दशकरोड़वाँ हिस्सा ग्रहों को मिलता है। इस प्रचण्डमार्त्तण्ड की उष्णता से हम लोग भस्मसात् क्यों नहीं हो जाते, इसका एक मात्र कारण यही है कि हम सूर्य से करीब १,१६,१२,५०० योजन के फासले पर हैं। अस्तु, हमें बताना यही था कि यह सहस्रदीधिति भगवान् अपने पूर्णतेज से इस विषुववृत्त के मध्य में तपते हैं। खगोल इस विषुवत् से आधा उत्तर में और आधा दक्षिण में है। इसके उत्तर भाग में १२,८,४ क्रमशः इन अंशों के अन्तर पर क्रान्तिवृत्त को काटते हुये तीन पूर्वापर कृत्त बनते हैं और इसी तरह इस विषुवत् के दक्षिण भाग में क्रान्तिवृत्त को काटते हुए १२,८ और ४ अंशों के अन्तर पर क्रमशः तीन पूर्वापर वृत्त बनते हैं। इस प्रकार कुल ६ पूर्वापर वृत्त बनजाते हैं, सातवाँ स्वयं विषुवत् है। इस तरह सब मिलाकर सात पूर्वापर वृत्त हो जाते हैं। इन्हीं को अहोरात्रवृत्त कहते हैं। येही सातों वेद में गायत्री, उष्णक्, अनुष्टुप् बृहती, पंक्ति, त्रिष्टुप और जगती– इन छन्दों के नाम से सूर्य के सात घोड़े प्रसिद्ध हैं। क्रान्तिवृत्त नाम का सूर्य के रथ का एक पद्दिया है। छन्दः और वृत्त ये दोनों शब्द एकार्थवाची हैं, अतः सप्तवृत्त या सप्तछन्द ये दोनों ही शब्द प्रयोग में आते हैं। उत्तर में सब से बड़ा जगती और दक्षिण में सब से छोटा गायत्री छन्द नाम का घोड़ा है, बीचवाला बृहतीछन्द सब से बड़ा है। यद्यपि मध्य का बृहतीछन्द (विषुवद्वृत्त) सब से बड़ा है, एवं दक्षिण तथा उत्तर के छन्द एक दूसरे के बराबर हैं, तथापि दृश्यमण्डल के अनुरोध से जगती को सब से बडा और गायत्री को सब से छोटा माना है। छन्दः की अक्षर गणना से भी देखा जाय तो जगतीछन्द ४८ अक्षरों का और गायत्रीछन्द २४ अक्षरों का ही होता है।

 अस्तु, हमें यहाँ इस वैदिक प्रणाली के विवेचन करने की आवश्यकता नहीं। हमें तो बताना यही था कि क्रान्तिवृत्त को काटते हुए जो सात पूर्वापर वृत्त बनते हैं, इनको खगोल विद्या में क्रम से कर्क, सिंह, कन्या, तुला, वृश्चिक, धन और मकरवृत्त कहते हैं। इनमें उत्तर भाग का सब से आखिरी कर्कवृत्त कहलाता है और दक्षिण भाग का सब से अन्तिम मकरवृत्त

नाम से प्रसिद्ध है। इसी के संबन्ध से मकरसंक्रान्ति होती है। हम ऊपर लिख आए हैं कि विषुववृत्त से उत्तर और दक्षिण में १२,८ और ४ अंशों के अन्तर पर तीन तीन पूर्वापर वृत्त बनते हैं। इन वृत्तों के सब अंशों को यदि जोड़लिया जाय तो दोनों भागों के कुल मिलकर ४८ अंश होजाते हैं। इस ४८ अंशात्मक भाग की आखिरी सीमा को घेरता हुआ जो दीर्घवृत्त बनता है इसे ही ऊपर बताया हुआ क्रान्तिवृत्त समझना चाहिये। अश्विनी आदि २८ नक्षत्र तथा बुध, बृहस्पति, शुक्र प्रभृति प्रहराशिगण इसी ४८ अंश के परिसर के भीतर घूमा करते हैं। इन २८ नक्षत्रों में अभिजित् संधिभाग में पड़जाता है। अतः कुल २७ नक्षत्र माने जाते हैं। ये नक्षत्र दक्षिण भाग में छोटे, मध्यभाग में मध्यम और उत्तरभाग में स्थूल हैं। ये अश्विन्यादि २८ नक्षत्र जिस वृत्तपर हैं, उस चान्द्रकक्षा को ‘दक्षवृत्त’ कहते हैं। दशों दिशाओं से प्रस्तुत 'प्रचेता' नामक रसों के संयोग से पैदा होने वाला दिक्सोममय प्राचेतसप्राण "दक्ष" कहलाता है। इस दक्ष के ६० कन्यायें हैं। “अग्निर्वृषा, योषा सोमः' इस परिभाषानुसार योषा रूप प्राण समूह दक्षवृत्त के ६० हिस्से ही ६० कन्या मानी गई हैं। अतएव “ददौ स दश धर्माय कश्यपात्रयोदश” इत्यादि पौराणिक वचनानुसार पृथक् पृथक् धम्मं-कश्यपादि योषा प्राण के उपभोगानुरोध से सौम्यप्राणमय यह दक्षवृत्त २७.१०,१३,२,२,२,४ इन सात विभागों में विभक्त हैं। चन्द्रमा के अनुरोध से २७ विभाग ही अश्विनी आदि २७ नक्षत्र समझने चाहिए। अरिष्ट के हिसाब से इस नक्षत्र मण्डल के ४ विभाग किए गए हैं। जैसा कि वेद में कहा है—

**“स्वस्ति न इन्द्रो वृद्धश्रवाः स्वस्ति नः पूषा विश्ववेदाः।  
स्वस्ति नस्तार्क्ष्योऽरिष्टनेमिः स्वस्ति नो बृहस्पतिर्दधातुः”॥**

 यहाँ वृद्धभवा से चित्रा नक्षत्र अभिप्रेत है, जो कि पूर्व स्वस्वस्तिक माना गया है। पूषा रेवती है, यह पश्चिम खस्वस्तिक ह। उत्तर खस्वस्तिक तार्क्ष्य है। ‘त्रयाणां ऋक्षाणां समूहस्तार्क्ष्यम्’ तीन नक्षत्रों के समूह को तादर्य कहते हैं, यह तार्क्ष्य श्रवणतारा है। इसी प्रकार दक्षिण स्वस्वस्तिक बृहस्पति (लुब्धक बन्धु) है। इन चार स्वस्वस्तिक में संपूर्ण नक्षत्र मण्डल विभक्त हैं। यह एक दूसरा नक्षत्र सन्निवेश का क्रम है। इसी तरह यह मण्डल देव और आसुर भेद से भी विभक्त है। इस क्रम में अश्विनी से चित्रा तक देवमंडल है। इसमें उत्पन्न हुआ प्राणीदैवो संपत्तिवान् होता है। जैसा कि गीता में लिखा है—

**“दैवीसंपद् विमोक्षाय, बन्धनायासुरीमता।  
दैवीसंपत्ति मभिजातोऽसि”। इत्यादि॥**

 यज्ञ जन्य दैवात्मा का स्वरूप यथावत् सिद्ध करने के लिए यज्ञ यागादि दैविक कार्य इसी दैवमण्डल में करने चाहिए। इसीलिये यजमान यज्ञारंभ में—“अश्विनोर्बाहुभ्यांपूष्णो हस्ताभ्यां त्वांऽऽददे नार्य्यसि” यह मन्त्र पढ़कर दैवमण्डल को ध्यान में लाता है।

 इस दैवमण्डल के प्रतिपक्ष में विशाखासे भरणी तक आसुरमण्डल है। अतः इसमें आसुरमण्डल की प्रधानता है। इसमें उत्पन्न हुआ प्राणी आसुरसंपत्ति की प्रधानता से क्रूरकर्मा होता है। मारणोञ्चाटनादि तंत्रोक्त क्रूरकार्य इसीलिये इस मण्डल में किये जाते हैं।  

 ये कुल नक्षत्र १–तारा^(५)नक्षत्र २–ताराव्यूह^(४)नक्षत्र ३–खदेश^(३)नक्षत्र, ४–गति^(२)नक्षत्रऔर ५–सांपातिक^(१)नक्षत्र इन भेदों से पाँच प्रकार के होते हैं ।

 १–जिस नक्षत्र पर वसन्तसंपात होता हो उससे शुरू करके, जितनी प्रतिदिन की चंद्रगति होती है उतनी दूर के प्रदेश को सांपातिक नक्षत्र कहते हैं। ये २८ नक्षत्र होते हैं। इस संपातबिन्दु के अस्थिर होने के कारण यह नक्षत्र प्रदेश का विभाग अस्थिर समझा गया है। क्योंकि शतपथ निर्माण काल में कृत्तिका नक्षत्र पर वसंतसंपात मानागया है, इसके बाद कौषितकब्राह्मण के रचनाकाल में रोहिणी पर वसंतसंपात समझा गया, फिर किसी समय पर मृगशिरनक्षत्र पर वसन्तसंपात माना जाने लगा और अब आजकल कृत्तिका से ५ नक्षत्र हटकर उत्तराभाद्रपद पर यह वसन्तसंपात माना जाता है। जिस समय जहां से संपात होता है, वहीं से वर्षारंभ होता है। यह हुआ सांपातिक नक्षत्रों का क्रम।

 २–दूसरे गतिनक्षत्र हैं, ये प्रतिदिन की चान्द्रगति के प्रदेश के हिसाब से २७ माने जाते हैं, क्योंकि इसमें अभिजित नक्षत्र के प्रदेश के अत्यल्प रहजाने के कारण यह गणना किई गई है।

 ३–यदि किसी नियत बिन्दु से नियताकाश को सम विभाग से नियत परिमाण में विभक्त किया जाय तो उस नियत प्रदेश में रहने वाले नक्षत्र को खदेश नक्षत्र कहेंगे। जैसे कि १३ अंश २० कला के प्रदेश को नक्षत्र मानकर रेवत्यन्त अंशावच्छिन्न प्रदेश से क्रान्तिवृत्त के १८० अंश की कल्पना करके २८ विभागों में विभक्त कियाजाय तो उस नियत प्रदेश में स्थित नक्षत्रों को स्वदेश नक्षत्र कहेंगे। नियताकाश में स्थित रहने के कारण ये स्थिर नक्षत्र कहलाते हैं।

 ४–असंख्य ताराओं में तत्तन्नक्षत्रों को पहिचानने के लिए तत्तन्नक्षत्र समष्टि से कल्पित मूर्तिमय नक्षत्रव्यूह को ताराव्यूह कहते हैं। जैसे तीन तारावाले अश्विनी नक्षत्र को पहिचानने

के लिये अश्वमुखाकृति की कल्पना करली गई है। इसी तरह भरणी, कृत्तिका आदि में भी समझ लेना चाहिये।

 ५–अनेक ताराओं से कल्पित ताराव्यूह में रहने पर भी इन प्रत्येक ताराओं का योगतारा एक ही माना जाता है। इस योगतारा को तारानक्षत्र कहते हैं, जैसे शतभिषा के सौ तारे होने पर भी उसका योगतारा एक शतभिषा माना जाता है। इस तरह यह नाक्षत्रिक विभाग समझना चाहिये।

 इन नक्षत्रों को समझाने के लिये आचार्यों ने ज्योतिषशास्त्र में पूर्वोक्त विषुववृत्त के दक्षिणोत्तर में १२, ८, ४ अंशों के अन्तर पर बने हुए तीन तीन पूर्वापर वृत्तों के ४८ अंशवाले मार्गके तीन मार्ग बना डाले हैं– १–ऐरावत, २–जरद्रव और ३–वैश्वानर। ये तीन मार्ग बड़े हैं। इन में तीन तीन नक्षत्रों के हिसाब से फिर छोटे मार्ग बनाए गये हैं जिन्हें वीथियाँ (गलियाँ) कहते हैं। येही ९ वीथियाँ ९ नाड़ीवृत्त हैं। जिस प्रकार सूर्य रथ का संबन्ध सात पूर्वापर अहोरात्रवृत्तों से है उसी तरह चन्द्रमा के रथ का संबन्ध इन ९ नाड़ी वृत्तों से है। इन वीथियों के नाम तथा इनमें नक्षत्रों का सन्निवेशक्रम इस प्रकार है—

 १–भरणी, कृत्तिका, स्वाति की *नागवीथी;* २–रोहिणी, मृगशिर, आर्द्रा की *गजवीथी;*३–पुनर्वसु,पुष्य,अश्लेषा की *ऐरावतवीथी* ४–मघा, पूर्वाफाल्गुनी, उत्तराफाल्गुनी की *वृषवीथी*; ५–पूर्वाभाद्रपद, उत्तराभाद्रपद, रेवती, अश्विनी की गोवीथी, ६–श्रवण, धनिष्ठा, शतभिषा की *जारद्रववीथी;* ७–अनुराधा,ज्येष्ठा,मूल की *मृगवीथी;* ८–हस्त, चित्रा, बिशाखा की *अजवीथी;* और ९–पूर्वाषाढ़, उत्तराषाढ़ की *वैश्वानरवीथी* होती है। क्रान्तिवृत्त के दक्षिण भाग की आखिरी सीमा वैश्वानरवीथी है और क्रान्तिवृत्त के उत्तर भाग की आखिरी सीमा नागवीथी समझनी चाहिये। इन ऊपर बताई हुई नाग, ऐरावत, गज इन तीन वीथियों का उत्तरमार्ग; वृष, गो, जारद्भव-इन वीथियों का मध्यमार्ग और मृग, अज, वैश्वानर इन वीथियों का दक्षिणमार्ग है। इन प्रत्येक मार्गकी तीन तीन वीथियों में भी पहिलीवीथी उस मार्ग के उत्तर में, दूसरी उस मार्ग के मध्य में और तीसरी उस मार्ग के दक्षिण में समझनी चाहिये। क्रान्तिवृत्त के उत्तर भाग में ४२ अंश का अन्तरिक्ष धर्मशास्त्र-पुराण आदि में वर्णित “**देवयान**” मार्ग है। इस के आगे ही सप्तर्षिमण्डल की स्थिति है। विषुवदुरेखा से ९० अंश उत्तर की ओर उत्तरीय ध्रुव की स्थिति है और उसी रेखा से ९० अंश दक्षिण की ओर दक्षिण ध्रुव की स्थिति है। यह सप्तर्षिमण्डल इस उत्तरीय ध्रुव से २४ अंश के अन्तर पर घूमता है। यहांतककी देवयान की स्थिति समझनी चाहिये। वैश्वानर-

वीथी क्रान्तिवृत्त को अन्तिम सीमा है। इसके आगे ४२ अंशात्मक “पितृयाण” मार्ग है। दक्षिणध्रुव से २४ अंश उत्तर की ओर अगस्त्य का तारा है, इस अगस्त्यतारा से उत्तर एवं वैश्वानरवीथी मे दक्षिण पितृयाण की स्थिति समझनी चाहिये। इसीलिये भगवान् वेदव्यास लिखते हैं—

**“उत्तरं यदगस्त्यस्य अजवीथ्याश्च दक्षिणम्।  
पितृयाणः सवै पन्था वैश्वानरपथाद् बहिः॥  
नागवीथ्युचरं यच्च सप्तर्षिभ्यश्च दक्षिणम्।  
उत्तरः सवितुः पन्था देवयान इति स्मृतः॥”इति ।**

 अस्तु। विषय का विस्तार बहुत बढगया, अतः इस प्रकरण को यहां ही समाप्त करते हैं। हमें केवल यही बतानाथा कि दृष्टि-विद्या संबन्धी निमित्तशास्त्र में प्रवेश करने के पूर्व ग्रह नक्षत्र प्रभृति की स्थिति जानलेना अत्यावश्यक है, जिसका कि कुछ दिग्दर्शन हमने पाठकों के सौकर्य के लिये यहां कर दिया है।

 प्राचीन समय में इस विद्या के विद्वान् उपर्युक्त चार निमित्तों के आधार पर सद्यः होनेवाली एवं विलम्ब में होनेवाली वर्षा का तथा इसी के आश्रय से सुभिक्ष, दुर्भिक्ष, महामारी आदि का भी बहुत समय पूर्वही निश्चय कर लिया करते थे कि अमुक अमुक देशों में अमुक अमुक समय पर, इतनी मात्रा में, वर्षा होगी और इस प्रकार का सुभिक्ष, दुर्भिक्ष होगा। इतना ही नहीं, बल्कि देतो वर्षा, अल्पवर्षा, अधिक वर्षा आदि दैवकोप की शान्ति के लिये ठीक ठीक प्रबन्ध भी कर लिया करते थे। आजकल के पाश्चात्य विद्वान्, जोकि हमारे चारों निमित्तों के कई पदार्थों में से केवल आन्तरिक्षनिमित्त के एक वायु के ही ज्ञान को (संभवतः वह भी पूरा नहीं) केवल सद्यो वृष्टिमात्र बताने वाले एक भाग को जानने में पर्याप्त धन खर्च कर बैठते हैं, इनकी तरह हमारे प्राचीन नैमित्तिक दैवज्ञों को इतने अपव्यय करने की न आवश्यकता ही होती थी और न इतना परिश्रम ही उन्हें उठाना पड़ता था। वे विद्वान् कार्तिकशुक्ला प्रतिपदा से कार्तिक कृष्णा अमावास्यातक के बारह महीनों की एक डायरी रखते थे, जिस में प्रतिदिन के प्रत्येक समय के चारों निमित्तों को यथावत् लिखते रहते थे और फिर उसी के अनुसार फल बता दिया करते थे। परन्तु आजकल कुछ समय से इन नैमित्तिक विद्वानों को राजा महाराजाओं आदि से सहायता न मिलने के कारण यह विद्या भारतवर्ष से लुप्तप्राय होगई है, और प्रायः सबही विद्वान् इस विद्या को छोड़ बैठे। अतः आजकल वृष्टि, सुभिक्ष, दुर्भिक्ष आदि का ज्ञान केबल पंचाङ्ग के आधार पर ही रह गया। अब भी यदि हमारी वृष्टिविया के चारों निमित्तों के आधार पर वृष्टिफल के देखने का पुनः प्रयत्न किया जाय, एवं एतदर्थं स्कूल, कालेजों आदि

में ज्योतिष आदि अन्य विषयों के साथ साथ इस विद्या के पढ़ाने का भी पाठ्यक्रम नियत किया जाय तो मुझे आशा ही नहीं, बल्कि पूरा विश्वास है कि विद्वान लोग इस में पूरी सफलता प्राप्त करके इस देश में इस विद्या को फिर से चमका सकते हैं। और धन तथा मान प्राप्त कर सकते हैं।

 हाँ, यह बात अवश्य है कि ऋषि, महर्षियों के इस विद्या के सिद्धान्त भिन्न भिन्न प्रन्थों में भिन्न भिन्न प्रणाली से प्रतिपादित हैं, उनमें से कई तो अब अलभ्य ही हैं; जो हैं उनमें भी प्राचीन पद्धति के अनुसार विषयों का प्रतिपादन बडे दुरूह क्रम से किया हुआ है, जिससे कोई सहसा लाभ नहीं उठा सकता और न सहसा उसके पढ़ने का साहस ही कर सकता है। ज्योतिषशास्त्र के कई लभ्य ग्रन्थ ऐसे हैं, जिनमें इस विषय का भी प्रतिपादन किया गया है; किन्तु उनमें भी कई जगह मत भेद सा दीख पड़ता है। जैसे शुक्लपक्ष और कृष्णपक्ष का प्रायः सबही प्रन्थों में झगड़ा देखने में आताहैं। कारण यह है कि कई तो पुराणाचार्य अमान्तमास मानते हैं और कई पूर्णिमान्त मास के पक्षपाती बनते हैं। इनमें शुक्लपक्षतो दोनों ही का एक मिल जाता है, परन्तु कृष्णपक्ष में एक महीने का अन्तर पड़ जाता है। क्योंकि कृष्णपक्ष की आदि से मासारंभ मानने वालों ने जहाँ चैत्र कृष्ण लिखा है; उसी को शुक्लपक्ष की आदि से मासारंभ मानने वालों ने फाल्गुनकृष्ण लिखा है। इस तरह कई जगह उसकी परिभाषा जाने बिना यह संदेह होजाता है कि कौनसा पाठ कृष्णपक्षादि से है और कौनसा शुक्लपक्ष के प्रारम्भ से है। यह निश्चितरूप से जाने बिना तिथियों के फल देखने में बहुत संदेह रह जाता है और फल भी ठीक-ठीक नहीं मिलता।

 यह प्रस्तुत पुस्तक, मैंने इन्हीं उपर्युक्त झगड़ों के दूर करने के लिये प्राचीन वृष्टिविद्या-संबन्धी निमित्तशास्त्रों के साररूप में एक नये ढंग से लिखी है। यह पुस्तक मेरे लिखे हुए “पर्जन्यशास्त्र” का एक भाग है। जिसका कि नाम “कादम्बिनी” रक्खा गया है। कादम्बिनी निमित्तशास्त्र है। कादम्बिनी अर्थ होता है–मेघमाला। मेघमाला से वर्षा का बोध होता है। आकाश में छायी हुई मेघमाला को देखकर, इस निमित्त के आधार पर यह ज्ञान होजाता है कि वृष्टि होगी। जैसे वृष्टि होने का निमित्त मेघमाला है, वैसे मेघमाला के होने का भी कुछ न कुछ निमित्त अवश्य होता है जिससे जान लिया जाता है कि आकाश मेघों से घिर जावेगा। इस तरह के वृष्टि विषयक निमित्तों की बोधरूप से वर्षा करानेवाला यह "कादम्बिनी" निमित्तशास्त्र मेघमाला के समान है। जिस प्रकार स्त्री के पेट में रहा हुआ गर्भ समय पर प्रसृत होता है, ठीक इसी प्रकार धौरूपी स्त्री के पेट में सूर्यरश्मियों के द्वारा रहा हुआ गर्भ आठ मास के बाद प्रसूत होता है। इसके इस प्रसवकाल को ही वर्षा ऋतु या चातुर्मास्य कहते हैं। इसीलिये शास्त्रों में भी लिखा है कि—

**“अष्टमासधृतं गर्भं भास्करस्य गभस्तिभिः।  
रसं सर्वसमुद्राणां द्यौः प्रसूते रसायनम्”॥इति।**

 इस पुस्तक में उक्त सिद्धान्तानुसार वृष्टियोनि, गर्भकाल, गर्भप्रसवकाल, गर्भविमान, गर्भोपघातक, गर्भेदोहद इत्यादि सब विषय क्रमशः प्रतिवादित किये गये हैं।

 यह इस पुस्तक का द्वितीय संस्करण है। प्रथम संस्करण केवल मूलमात्र काही प्रकाशित हुआ था किन्तु इस संस्करण में इस पुस्तक का भाषानुवाद भी संमिलित कर दिया गया है। हमें आशा है कि इस अनुवाद से जनता को अवश्यमेव पूर्णलाभ होगा।

 अन्त में हम पाठक सज्जनों से, मनुष्य स्वभाव सुलभ, त्रुटि आदि के लिये क्षमा-याचना कर ते हुए यह लेख समाप्त करते हैं।

 ग्रन्थ के आरंभ में मांगलिक शब्द का प्रयोग करना "समाप्तिकामो मंगल माचरेत्” इत्यादि शिष्टाचार नियम से आवश्यक माना गया है। अतएव श्रीविद्यावाचस्पतिजी ने निर्विघ्न ग्रन्थ समाप्ति के लिये ईश्वरवाचक अपने नाम का प्रयोग करके ग्रन्थ लिखने का प्रयोजन भी इसी प्रथम पथ के द्वारा बता दिया है।

संपादक।

 १–विद्यावाचस्पति श्री मधुसूदनजी ओझा, वृष्टि-विद्या बतानेवाली इस कादम्बिनी नामक पुस्तक को, सब संसार के हित के लिये निर्माण करते हैं।

 २-३–प्रकृति की परीक्षा करनेवाले जिन श्रद्धेय आचार्य चरणों ने सिद्धान्त निश्चित किएहैं। उनके निर्दिष्ट पथपर चलने से मनुष्य अपने अभीष्ट को शीघ्र ही प्राप्त कर लेता है। इसीलिए मैं (ग्रन्थकार) वृष्टि-विद्या के आचार्य-शिव, बृहस्पति, गर्ग, वसिष्ठ, काश्यप, भृगु, सहदेव, वराहमिहिर और पराशर प्रभृति का स्मरण करता हूँ।

 ४-५–वेदानुसार अपने उग्र तप के प्रभाव से इन आचार्यों ने जो वृष्टि-विज्ञान निश्चित किया है उसी का यह अनुवचन है।

 इन आचार्यों ने वैदिक विज्ञान द्वारा समस्त विषयों में पूर्णज्ञान प्राप्त किया है, और उनका यह अटल सिद्धान्त है कि “**विदितवेदितव्यावयम्**"। “**ब्रह्म विद्ययैव सर्वं भविष्यन्तो मन्यन्ते**” इत्यादि किन्तु यदि इनके सिद्धान्तों में इस समय काल वा लेख दोष से कहीं पर विपरीतता दिखाई देती होतो परीक्षा करके अवश्य ही उसका संशोधन कर लेना चाहिये।

 ६–वसव्य, शर्मण्य, सपीती, मरूत आदि जिन देवताओं के कारण वृष्टि होती हैं, उनकी मैं प्रार्थना करता हूँ।

 इन देवताओं का वृष्टि के साथ जो सम्बन्ध है, वह तैत्तिरीय-संहिता में विशेष करक दिखाया गया है।

 ७–अग्नि, वायु, सूर्य और सोम की मैं प्रार्थना करता हूँ, जिनके द्वारा जल आकाश में जाता है, ठहरता है, स्थान से च्युत होता है और बरसता है। सोम (रस) भाग जल है। यह अग्नि द्वारा ऊपर जाता है और सूर्य इसे वृष्टि के अधिष्ठाता वायु (पर्जन्य) के द्वारा यहाँ बरसाता है। जैसा कि वेद में लिखा है—

**“समान मेतदुदकमुच्चैत्यव चाहभिः।  
भूमिं पर्जन्या जिन्वन्ति दिवं जिन्वन्त्यग्नयः”(ऋ० सं० १।१।२।५१)  
अग्निर्वा इतो वृष्टिमुदीरयति। मरुतः सृष्टां नयन्ति।  
यदा खलु वाऽसावादित्यो न्यङ्श्मिभिः पर्यावर्तते, अथ वर्षति॥ (तै० सं० २।४।१०)**

 यह जल समान रूप में वर्त्तमान अहर्गण के द्वारा ऊपर जाता है और नीचे आता है। पर्जन्य इसे पृथ्वी पर पहुँचाते हैं और अग्नि द्युलोक में अर्थात् पर्जन्य के द्वारा वृष्टि होती है और अग्नि के द्वारा यह जल द्युलोक में जाता है । (ऋ० सं० १।१।२।५१)

 यहां से अग्नि वृष्टिको ऊपर भेजता है और मरुत् (पर्जन्य वायु) उत्पन्न हुई वृष्टि को जाता। जब यह आदित्य किरणों द्वारा नीचे को पर्यावृत्ति करता है तब वृष्टि होती है । (तै० सं० २।४।१०)

 ८–आग में डाली हुई आहुति आदित्य (सूर्य) को मिलती है। और सूर्य से वर्षा होती है, वर्षा से अन्न और अन्न से प्रजा का पालन होता है। (आग में डाली हुई आहुति की वस्तु गर्मी के कारण विशकलित हो जाती है-अर्थात् उस वस्तु के प्रत्येक परमाणु अलग अलग होजाते है। और इन्हें सूक्ष्म तथा हलके होने से आदित्य अपने किरणों में उठा लेता है, तब इस वृष्टि से अन्न पैदा होता है और अन्न से प्रजा जीवित रहती है। बस, इसी विज्ञान को लक्ष्य में रखकर मनु महाराज ने उपरिलिखित “**अग्नौ प्रास्ता०**” यह श्लोक लिखा है।)

 ९–उपरिलिखित भाव को लेते हुये आदि कवि वाल्मीकिजी ने भी रामायण में यह श्लोक लिखा है। वर्षा ऋतु का वर्णन है—

 आकाश सूर्य की किरणों द्वारा आठ महीने (कार्त्तिक शुक्ला प्रतिपदा से आषाढ शुक्ला प्रतिपदा) तक गर्भ रूप में धारण किये हुए समस्त समुद्रों के रसायन रूप जल को जन्म देरहा है अर्थात् वृष्टि करता है।

 जब शीतकाल में समुद्र के (स्वस्वस्तिक के) ऊपर रहता है तब वह अपनी तीव्र किरणों से समुद्र के जलको तपाकर हलका बना लेता है और हलके होने के कारण वह अपनी किरणों में धारण भी कर लेता है। इसी धारण किये हुए जल को फिर वह आकाश में फैला देता है। इस तरह आकाश में वह सूर्य द्वारा फैलाया हुआ जल ८ मास के बाद अर्थात् चातुर्मास्य में

वरस जाता है। इस प्रकार यहाँ सूर्य को गर्भ धारण कराने वाला पुरुष मानकर आकाशरूपी स्त्री से जल का प्रसव होना बताया गया है। यह भाव ब्रह्म पुराण और विष्णु पुराण के निम्नलिखित चार श्लोकों में भी हैं।

 १०–सूर्य आठ महीनों तक मौलिकजल (हाईड्रोजन) लेकर उसे इस पेयजल में परिणत करके वरसाता है, इस से अन्न होता है, और अन्न से समस्त संसार जीवित रहता है।

 ११–सूर्य पृथ्वी में स्थित जिस रस (मौलिकजल) को किरणों द्वारा ग्रहण करता है, उसे वह धान्य पैदा होने के लिये एवं प्राणियों की पुष्टि के लिये फिर वापिस बरसा देता है।

 १२–सूर्य भगवान् अपनी किरणों द्वारा नदी, समुद्र, पृथ्वी में एवं प्राणियों के शरीर में स्थित इस तरह चार प्रकार के– जल को ग्रहण करता है।

 १३-१४–अपनी तीक्ष्ण किरणों से सूर्य पृथ्वी के (से) जल को लेकर सोम को पुष्ट करता है, और वह सोम वायु नाड़ियों में विद्यमान जल के द्वारा आकाश में धूम-अभि और हवा की मूर्ति वाले बादलों में इधर उधर घूमता फिरता है, तथा बादलों का जल वायु से प्रेरित होकर पृथ्वी पर गिरता है।

 १५–आकाश चन्द्रमा से वायु, सफेद बादल, बिजली, गर्जना एवं अल्पवृष्टि के द्वारा गर्भ धारण करता है। अर्थात् उपरिलिखित इन पाँचों लक्षणों के दिखाई देने से आकाश में गर्भ धारण समझना चाहिये। इन पाँचों में से जितने भी कम लक्षण हो उतनी ही गर्भ में कमी होती है।

 (चन्द्रमा सोम के कारण शीत प्रकृति का है। जिस नक्षत्र काल में सूर्य की किरणों द्वारा जल आकाश में गया है, यदि उसी नक्षत्र पर चन्द्रमा भी है तो वह जल उसी शीत के प्रभाव से वहाँ स्थिर होजाता है इसी को गर्भ धारण होना कहते हैं। हाँ, यदि सूर्य और चन्द्रमा के मध्य में अग्निसम्बन्धी ग्रह जैसे मंगल, अथवा वायुसम्बन्धी ग्रह जैसे शनि आदि आजावे तो चन्द्रमा उस गर्भ को धारण नहीं कर सकता, क्योंकि इन अभि-वायुसम्बन्धी ग्रहों के कारण उसका प्रभाव कम होजाता है, और यदि उस समय गर्भ रह भी गया तो कुछ दिनों में उसका पात हो जायगा। चन्द्रमा गर्भ धारण करवाता है इसीलिए वेद में भी लिखा है कि “**सोमोवैरेतोधाः**” शत० इति।)

 इस प्रकरण में वर्षा के गर्भकाल, दोहदकाल और प्रसवकाल का वर्णन किया गया है। शीतकाल को गर्भ का, उष्णकाल को दोहद (गर्भपोषण) और वर्षाकाल को प्रसव का समय माना जाता है। किस महीने से शीतकाल और किस महीने से उष्णकाल और वर्षाकाल माना जाय इस विषय में जितने मतभेद हैं वे क्रम से बताये जाते हैं।

 १६–किसी का मत है कि-मार्गशीर्ष से चार महीने फाल्गुन तक शीतकाल, चैत्र से चार महीने आषाढ तक उष्णकाल और श्रावण से चार महीने कार्त्तिक तक वर्षाकाल होता है।

 १७–इस समय में कार्त्तिक से माघ तक शीतकाल, फाल्गुन से ज्येष्ठ तक उध्यकाल और आषाढ से आश्विन तक वर्षाकाल माना जाता है।

 १८–शीतकाल में गर्भ धारण होता है, इसके बाद उष्णकाल में उसका परिपाक (पोषण) होता है और वर्षाकाल में वह प्रसूत होजाता है, अर्थात् बरस जाता है।

 १९–ज्येष्ठा नक्षत्र के आस पास जब अमावस्या होवे तब गर्भकाल और ज्येष्ठानक्षत्र के आस पास जब पूर्णिमा होवे तब प्रसवकाल अर्थात् वर्षाकाल समझना चाहिये। यह भी किसी का मत है।

 मार्गशीर्ष की अमावस्या को और ज्येष्ठ की पूर्णिमा को प्रायः ज्येष्ठा नक्षत्र आयाकरता है।

 २०–कई विद्वान् निम्नलिखित हिसाब से गर्भ और प्रसवकाल का विभाग मानते हैं-मूल नक्षत्र के उतरार्द्ध में सूर्य के आने से गर्भकाल और आर्द्रा नक्षत्र पर सूर्य आने से प्रसवकाल होता है। अर्थात् मूल नक्षत्र पर जब सूर्य आवे तब से ६ दिन बाद से ४ मास तक गर्भकाल और आर्द्रा पर वे तब से ४ मास तक प्रसवकाल माना जाय।

 मूल पर सूर्य पौष के महीने में और आर्द्रा पर आषाढ में प्रायः आया करता है, और १३ दिन तक रहता है।

 २१–कई कहते हैं कि-जिस पात से सूर्य दक्षिणायन हो वह गर्भकाल का प्रारंभ और जिस पात से उत्तरायण हो वह प्रसवकाल माना जाता है।

 २२- २३–गर्भकाल के प्रारंभ का दिन मानने के विषय में किसी ग्रन्थ का यह मत है कि स्वाति पर सूर्य के आने से, या स्वाति के सूर्य में स्वाति नक्षत्र पर चन्द्रमा के होने से वा स्वाति के सूर्य पर अश्विनी के चन्द्रमा होने से, अथवा अनुराधा के सूर्य में अनुराधा नक्षत्र पर चन्द्रमा के आने से, या मूल पर सूर्य के आने से गर्भकाल का प्रारंभ होता है। इन पाँचों में मूलाक से उत्तर के दृढ़ फल वाले हैं और पहिले के मन्द फल हैं।

 इस प्रकरण में विशेष करके गर्भ के प्रसव (वर्षा) काल काही वर्णन किया जायगा। २४–सूर्य दक्षिणगोल में ही हो किन्तु उत्तरायण हो चुका हो ऐसे समय में जिस नक्षत्र

पर पहिले लिखे हुए वायु, बादल आदि पाँच प्रकार से गर्भस्थिति होजाय तो उसी नक्षत्र पर चन्द्रमा के आठवीं बार आने पर वर्षा होती है।

 २५–कई वैज्ञानिकों का मत है कि सूर्य, चन्द्रमा, नक्षत्र इन में से कोई भी वर्षा होने में कारण (सबब) नहीं बनता । केवल वायु से उठाया हुआ जल वायुद्वारा ही बरसाया जाता है ।

 (वास्तव में देखा जाय तो पृथ्वी पर से पदार्थों के आकाश में उठाने का कार्य अग्नि (तेज) ही करता है, इसलिये इसका नाम वन्हितम (भारवाही - हव्यवाहक) प्रसिद्ध है।

 इस जल को भी पृथ्वी पर से यही अग्नि \[तेज\] सूर्य की किरणों द्वारा आकाश में उठाता है, जैसा कि हम पहिले भी लिख चुके हैं। किन्तु यह अनि आकाश में जाकर वायुरूप में बदल जाता है। इसको वेद में सवृत्तिवायु कहते हैं। यह स्वाति नक्षत्र से प्रकट होती है। इस वायु के चलने से वर्षा भी होती है। अतएव वेद में कहा जाता है कि-“**सविता वै** **देवानां प्रसविता**”–इत्यादि। बस, इसी विज्ञान को लेकर वायुद्वारा जल का उठाना और बरसाना यहाँ पर कहाँ गया है।)

 २६–सूर्य के दक्षिणगोल में रहने के कारण तपे हुए समुद्र से जल उठता है और वह वायु द्वारा आकाश में फैलाया हुआ जल देश देश में बरसता है।

 जब सूर्य दक्षिणगोल में रहता है तो उत्तरगोल में इसकी किरणें बहुत कम तज वाली रहती हैं। और दक्षिणगोल में विशेष तपती हैं। इसी कारण दक्षिणीसमुद्र का तपा हुआ जल भाप बन करके आकाश में किरणों द्वारा उठा लिया जाता है। और फिर वह वायु द्वारा समय पर बरसाया जाता है।

 २७–आकाश में वायुद्वारा इधर उधर फेंका जाने वाला बादल ठहर जाता है, वह बादल जिस नक्षत्र के नीचे होता है उसी नक्षत्र पर समझा जाता है।

 २८–जिस नक्षत्र पर चन्द्रमा के रहते हुए गर्भस्थिति हुई हो, उसी नक्षत्र पर आठवीं बार चन्द्रमा के आने से अर्थात् १९५ दिन में, उस दिन की गर्भस्थिति का जल बरस जाता है।

 २९–शुक्लपक्ष का रहा हुआ गर्भ कृष्णपक्ष में, कृष्णपक्ष का गर्भशुक्लपक्ष में और दिन का गर्भ रात्रि में तथा रात्रि का गर्भ दिन में वरसता है।

 (कारण यह है कि यद्यपि जिस पक्ष या जिस समय आकाश में गर्भ रहता है, वरसनेके समय भी उसी पक्ष और उसी समय के आकाश में रहता है, किन्तु वह आकाश पृथ्वी की चाल के कारण छः महीने बाद उलटा दिखाई पडता है। अर्थात् उस गर्भस्थिति के समय का आकाश यदि शुक्लपक्ष का है तो छः महीने बाद वह कृष्णपक्ष में पडेगा, या कृष्णपक्ष का है तो छः महीने बाद शुक्लपक्ष में। इसी तरह दिन का होगा तो वह आकाश छः महीने बाद रात्रि में और रात्रि का होगा तो वह छः महीने बाद दिन में पड़ेगा।)

 ३०-३१–जिस पक्ष में गर्भस्थिति हो, उससे चौदहवें पक्ष में अर्थात् गर्भस्थिति से साढे छः महीने के अन्त के दिन में वर्षा होती है। जैसे—

 कार्त्तिकशुक्ल में रहा हुआ गर्भ वैशाखकृष्ण में और चैत्रशुक्ल का गर्भ आश्विन मेंबरसेगा।

 ३२–पूर्व की दिशा से उठा हुआ बादल और वायु पश्चिम दिशा में और पश्चिम दिशा से उठा हुआ बादल और वायु पूर्व की दिशा में जल बरसाता है। इसी तरह अन्य दिशाओं का भी यह हिसाब इसी विपरीत क्रम से जानना चाहिये ।

 इस प्रकरण में गर्भ के जल की नाप का वर्णन है।

 ३३–रोहिणी, पूर्वाभाद्रपद, उत्तराभाद्रपद, पूर्वाषाढ़ और उत्तराषाढ़ नक्षत्रों में रहा हुआ गर्भ बहुत वृष्टि करता है। आर्द्रा, अश्लेषा, मघा, स्वाति और शतभिषा नक्षत्र के गर्भ से झड़ लगते हैं अर्थात् कई दिन तक थोड़ा थोड़ा जल रात दिन बरसा करता है।

 ३४–मार्गशीर्ष से छः महीनों में उपरिलिखित आर्द्रा अश्लेषा आदि पांचों नक्षत्रों में से यदि किसी में गर्भ रहे तो क्रम से उन छः महीनों में आठ, छः, सोलह, चोबीस, बीस और तीन दिन तक वृष्टि होती है। अर्थात् मार्गशीर्ष में आठ, पौष में छः, माघ में सोलह, फाल्गुन में चोबीस, चैत्र में बीस और वैशाख में तीन दिन तक वृष्टि होती है।

 ३५–पहिले बताये हुये वायु, बादल आदि पाँच प्रकार से रहा हुआ गर्भं समय पर अर्थात् ६॥ महीने बाद सौ योजन (४०० कोस) के घुमेर में बरसता है । इन पांचों में एक एक लक्षण की कमी से गर्भ रहने पर उस सौयोजन के घुमेर में भी एक एक भाग के योजन की कमी करलेनी चाहिये। अर्थात् पाँचों लक्षणों से रहा हुआ गर्भ १०० योजन के घुमेर में, चार लक्षणों का ७५ योजन में, तीन का ५० में और दो या एक का २५ योजन के घुमेर में बरसता है।

 ३६–इन पांचों लक्षणों में भी केवल हवा से रहा हुआ गर्भ तीन आढक[^1] का एक आढक होता है। चार आढक का १ द्रोण। (कादम्बिनी द्वादश अ० श्लोक ३१३)"), बिजली से छः आढक, बादलों से नव आढक और गर्जना से बारह आढक और पांचों (वायु, विद्युत्, बादल, गर्जना, अल्पवृष्टि) से रहा हुआ गर्भ पाँच द्रोण जल बरसाता है।

[^1]: "पचास पल (तोला

 ३७–चन्द्रमा और सूर्य के सौम्य प्रहों (चंद्र, रवि, शुक्र, बुध, गुरु) से युक्त होने पर गर्भ रहे तो वर्षा अच्छी होती है। और क्रूर ग्रहों (शनि, मंगल, राहु, केतु, एवं वक्र हुआ बुध) से युक्त होने पर गर्भ रहे तो, बज्रपात, ओले, मत्स्य आदि के सहित वृष्टि होती है।

 ३८–गर्भकाल के समय अतिवृष्टि होने से गर्भनाश हो जाता है। इस में द्रोण के आठवें भाग से अधिक वर्षा होने से गर्भस्राव (पात) समझना चाहिये।

 ३९–गर्भकाल के दिनों में पाँचों प्रकार से रहा हुआ भी गर्भं उस समय अधिक वर्षा होने से नष्ट होजाता है। इसका बचा हुआ जल वर्षा ऋतु में कहीं कहीं कुछ बूँदें गिरा देता है।

 ४०–सब तरह से पुष्ट हुआ गर्भ यदि प्रसव (वर्षाऋतु) के समय ग्रहों के दोष से नहीं बरसे तो उसी गर्भ धारण किये हुए दिन में भोले बनकर गिरता है।

 ४१–बहुत समय तक रक्खा हुआ दूध जिस तरह जम कर गाढ़ा होजाता है उसी तरह बहुत समय तक गर्भ \[आकाश\] में रक्खा हुआ जल भी कठिन अर्थात् भोले के रूप में परिणत हो जाता है।

 इस प्रकरण में गर्भ के नाश करनेवाले उपद्रवों का वर्णन है।

 ४२-४३–गर्भ के नाश करनेवाले उत्पात तीन प्रकार के हैं। पार्थिव, अन्तरिक्ष्य और दिव्य। इन निम्नलिखित उत्पातों के होने से गर्भ का स्राव होजाता है, अथवा समय पर बरसता नहीं, वा कम बरसता है इत्यादि। वे उत्पात ये हैं- भूचाल का होना, कील गिरना, गन्धर्वपुर, धूमकेतु, ग्रहों का युद्ध, निर्घात, परिघ धनुष का दीखना और सूर्य-चन्द्रमा का ग्रहण होना या गर्भमास के चिह्नों का बदल जाना।

 *भूचाल* चार प्रकार के होते हैं-आग्नेय, ऐन्द्र, वारुण और वायव्य। पृथ्वी की अग्नि की गति से आग्नेयकंप होता है, इस कंप में कहीं से जमीन तोड़कर आग की ज्वाला निकलती है। ग्रहों की चाल से ऐन्द्रकंप होता है। जब पृथ्वी के एक तरफ शनि हो, और दूसरी तरफ मंगल हो तो ये दोनों उस क्षण में सारी पृथ्वी को एकदम घुमा देते हैं। यही कंप सब से भयंकर और समस्त पृथ्वी भाग में होने वाला है। तीसरा कंपवारुण है, अर्थात् जल से होने वाला है यह समुद्र के आस पास के देशों में विशेष होता है। चौथा वायु की गति से वायव्यकंप होता है। *उल्कापात*में रात्रि के समय आकाश में प्रकाश की एक लंबी लाइन सी दीखती है किन्तु वह प्रारंभ में मोटी और पुच्छ भागों में पतली होती है। रजोवृष्टि में दिन के समय आकाश बिलकुल धुंधला दिखाई देता है। *दिग्दाह* से सुबह-शाम दिशाओं में आग जलती हुई दिखाई देती है। *वज्र* दो तरह के होते हैं-वज्र और महावज्र। वत्र त्रिकोण और महावज्र षट्कोण होता है।*कीलपात*में पश्चिम से पूर्व तक एक लम्बी लोहे के समान रेखा आकाश में दीखने लगती है। *गन्धर्वपुर* से आकाश में बादलों के नगर, मकान आदि दीखते हैं। आकाश में धूमकेतु नामक नये सारे उगते हैं। इनमें कई तारों का झुण्ड़ होता है। रण में एक पुच्छलतारा भी होता है। *निर्घात* होने से बड़े जोर की आवाज आती है। *परिघ* होने से उदय और अस्त के समय सूर्यबिम्ब के तीन तरफ काली रेखा दीखने लगती है। *धनुः–*इन्द्रधनुष को कहते हैं।

 ४४–इस तरह से गर्भ के नष्ट करने के दुर्निमित्त कहे गये हैं, अब आगे जिन से गर्भ का पोषण होता है वे निमित्त कहे जाते हैं।

 ४५–गर्भ के दोहद \[पोषण\] काल में अर्थात् उष्णकाल में उत्तर, ईशान और पूर्व की वायु चले और वह वायु कोमल और हृदय को प्रसन्नता देती हुई हो तो इससे गर्भ पुष्ट होता है। तथा सूर्य और चन्द्रमा के चौतरफ सफ़ेद, चिकना और बड़ा मण्डल हो तो वह गर्भ को पुष्ट करनेवाला है।

 पृथ्वी अपने स्थान पर (गिर्द) घूमती हुई पश्चिम से पूर्व को चलती रहती है और सूर्य के चारों ओर घूमती हुई ईशान-कोण की तरफ झुकी हुई उत्तर को जाया करती है। पवन सामने की दिशाओं से उत्तर, ईशान और पूर्व से आता हुआ प्रतीत होता है। यह इधर की हवा परमेष्ठी (आकाश में सोमपदार्थ के एक मण्डल) से ध्रुव तक की ठंड़क को लिए हुए होती है, इसलिये यह गर्भ पुष्ट करती है।

 ४६–विजलियाँ, इन्द्रधनुष, धीमीगर्जना और सूर्य के बिंघ के आगे छोटे छोटे वृत्त मण्डल (कुण्डलना) के होने से, तथा स्निग्ध फैले हुए बड़े बड़े बादलों के होने से और कभी साफ़ चन्द्रमा वाले आकाश के दिखाई देने से भी गर्भ पुष्ट हुआ समझना चाहिये।

 ४७–रवि, भौम, बुध आदि ग्रहगण भी स्निग्ध गति के हों, पुष्ट हों अर्थात् इनके तारों का प्रकाश खूब चमकीला एवं स्निग्ध हो और ग्रहण से युक्त न हो तथा सूर्य के दक्षिण की तरफ इनकी गति हो तो यह भी गर्भ के पुष्ट करनेवाले होते हैं। इसी तरह यदि पशु-पक्षि-गण भी स्वभाव से ही बिना घबराये हुए की तरह सुन्दर आवाज करते हों और प्रसन्न दिखाई दें, तो गर्भ पुष्ट हुआ समझना चाहिये।

 ४८–उपरिलिखित ये सब लक्षण सब ऋतुओं के गर्भों की पुष्टि करनेवाले कहे गये हैं। अब महीनों के क्रम से खास खास लक्षण हैं, वे आगे कहे जाते हैं।

 ४९–मार्गशीर्ष और पौष में सन्ध्या के समय ललाई का होना, सूर्य, चन्द्रमा के कुण्डलना होना और बादलों का होना गर्भ पुष्टि का लक्षण है।

 मार्गशीर्ष में अधिक ठंड़ न पड़कर, पौष में अधिक ठंड़ पड़े, तो यह भी गर्भ पुष्टि का अच्छा लक्षण है।

 ५०–माघ में विशेष वायु चले, पाला गिरने से ग्रहों के तारों का प्रकाश कम हो, विशेष ठंड़ पड़े और सूर्य के उदयास्त समय बादल हों तो गर्भ पुष्ट हुए समझने चाहिये।

 ५१-५२–फाल्गुन मास में रूखी और जोर की हवा चले, स्निग्धता को लिये हुए सफेद बादल दिखाई दें, सूर्य-चन्द्रमा के चौतरफ अधूरे चक्र हों और सूर्य कपिल या ताम्रवर्णं का हो तो ये गर्भ पुष्टि के लक्षण हैं। तथा फाल्गुन में वृक्षों के पत्तों को गिराता हुआ तेज पवन चले और चैत्र में दक्षिण दिशा का अत्यन्त मधुरवायु बद्दे, तो वह भी गर्भ की पुष्टि करता है।

 ५३–चैत्र में वायु चले, कुण्डलना हो, कुछ वर्षा तथा सफेद बादल हों तो गर्भ को पुष्ट हुआ समझना चाहिये।

 वैशाख में वायु, विजली, वृष्टि, सफेद बादल और गर्जना होना गर्भ पुष्टि का लक्षण है।

 ५४–ऊपर लिखे हुए प्रकारों से गर्भ पुष्टि के लक्षण तो हों और गर्भ के नष्ट करनेवाले उत्पात नहीं हों, तो वहाँ अच्छी वर्षा होती है और आनन्द प्रवृत्त होता है।

 १–सब महीनों में नक्षत्रों का बढ़ना अच्छा है। क्योंकि नक्षत्र वृद्धि से गायें बहुत धीदूध वाली होती हैं, और प्रजा में उपद्रव नहीं होते।

 २–वर्षा ऋतु के तीनों महीनों में अर्थात् आर्द्रा नक्षत्र पर जब सूर्य आवे उस दिन से ९० दिन तक नक्षत्र बढ़े या तिथि बढ़े, तो अच्छा समय कहना चाहिये।

 *तिथि या नक्षत्र के बढ़ने और घटने का कारण।* ज्यौतिषशास्त्र में माना गया है कि एक सूर्योदय से दूसरे सूर्योदय तक ६० घड़ी अर्थात् २४ घंटे होते हैं और तिथि तथा नक्षत्र भी ६० घड़ी (२४ घंटे) के ही हुआ करते हैं। चन्द्रमा पृथ्वी के गिर्द घूमता हुआ सर्पिलगति में रहता है। इसका कारण यह है कि पृथ्वी स्थिर नहीं है, किन्तु सूर्य के गिर्द घूमती हुई अपने स्थान से कुछ २ आगे बढ़ती जाती है। सर्पिलगति में घूमता हुआ चन्द्रमा अठाईसवें वर्ष में उसी बिन्दु पर जाता है जिस विन्दु से कि उसकी गति का प्रारंभ माना जाय। इस गति में चन्द्रमा कभी तो पृथ्वी के समीप आ जाता है और कभी दूर चलाजाता है, किन्तु यह याद रखना चाहिये कि चन्द्रमा की अपनी चाल सदैव एकसी रहती है। लेकिन जब वह पृथ्वी के समीप होता है तब उसकी गति तीव्र मालुम होती है और चन्द्रमा पृथ्वी से दूर चला जाता है तब उसकी चालधीमी मालुम देने लगती है। अर्थात् जब चन्द्रमा के घूमने का मार्ग संकुचित होता है तब उसकीगति तेज प्रतीत होती है और जब उसके घूमने का मार्ग बड़ा होता है तब धीमी चाल प्रतीत होनेलगती है। धीमी चाल के कारण कभी कभी तिथि और नक्षत्र बीच में ही समाप्त हो जाते हैं, सूर्योदय के समय नहीं रहते, तब इस देश में तिथि या नक्षत्र का क्षय मान लिया जाता है। तीव्र गति के समय कभी कभी एक ही नक्षत्र या तिथि दो सूर्योदय काल तक रह जाते हैं। इस दशा में तिथि या नक्षत्र की वृद्धि मानी जाती है। तथा ज्योतिष का सिद्धान्त भी यही है कि नक्षत्र तथा तिथि वही मानी जाती है जोकि सूर्योदय काल में रहे। बस, इस तरह तिथि या नक्षत्र घटा-बढ़ा करते हैं ।

 ३–कृष्णपक्ष की कही हुई बातें अगर नियत दिनों में नहीं मिले, तो उस पक्ष के आगे के या पीछे के कृष्णपक्ष में उनकी परीक्षा करनी चाहिये। पहिले कई ग्रन्थ अमान्तमास के हिसाब से लिखे गये हैं तथा आजकल विशेष व्यवहार पूर्णिमान्तमास का है, अतः कहीं कहीं इस से विरुद्ध फल हो जाता है। आजकल महीने का आरंभ कृष्णपक्ष से मान कर उसकी समाप्ति पूर्णिमा पर मानी जाती है। लेकिन वास्तव में देखा जाय तो शुक्लपक्ष से मास का प्रारंभ करके, कृष्णपक्ष की अमावस्या को उस मास की समाप्ति माननी चाहिये। जिसे कि अमान्तमास कहते हैं। इस से चन्द्रमा का विशेष सम्बन्ध है। देखिए-पूर्णिमा के रोज चन्द्रमा पूर्ण अपनी यौवन अवस्था पर रहता है। फिर वह शनैः शनैः नित्य क्षीण होता हुआ अमावस्या को सर्वथा नष्ट हो जाता है। अर्थात् उसकी मृत्यु हो जाती है। और पुनः शुक्लपक्ष की प्रतिपदा से वह जन्म लेता है। इस तरह अमान्तमास

में जन्म से मृत्यु पर्यन्त चन्द्रमाकी एक आयु पूर्ण हो जाती है। अतः यही अमान्तमास मानना उचित है। और इसीलिये पहले के ग्रन्थ इस मासके हिसाब से लिखे गये हैं।

 आज कल कई विद्वान् कहते हैं कि पूर्णमासी शब्द में मास शब्द महीने का वाचक है और मासके पूर्ण होनेके कारण ही इस तिथिको पूर्णमासी कहते हैं। किन्तु इस तरह मानना उनकी भूल है। यहाँ मास शब्द महीने का वाचक नहीं है, किन्तु मसी परिणामे धातुसे सिद्ध हुआ '**मास**' नाम है चन्द्रमा का (**मस्यति परिणमते–इति माः**) अतः पूर्णमासी उसी तिथिका नाम है कि जिस दिन चन्द्रमाकी कलायें पूर्ण हो गई हों।

 अमान्तमास पूर्णिमान्तमा ससे पन्द्रह दिन पीछेसे आरंभ होता है। इसलिये शुक्लपक्ष तो दोनों में एकसा ही रहता है। लेकिन कृष्णपक्ष अमान्तमासके हिसाब में पूर्णिमान्तमासकी अपेक्षा पिछले महीने पड़ता है। इसलिये अमान्तमास के अनुसार कृष्णपक्ष में कहे हुए धर्म यदि पूर्णिमान्तमास के अनुसार निर्दिष्ट मास में नहीं मिले तो आगे के मासमें समझ लेने चाहिये। और यदि पूर्णिमान्त मासके अनुसार किसी ग्रन्थमें कृष्णपक्षके धर्म कहे गये हैं तो अमान्तमास के अनुसार पीछेके महीने में जान लेने चाहिये।

 ४–कई ऐसी तिथियाँ हैं कि जिनमें नियमित रूप से गर्भ हुआ ही करते हैं। इनमें गर्भ का होना स्वाभाविक है। अगर उन तिथियों में गर्भ के लक्षण दिखाई नहीं दें तो इसमें किसी ग्रह की रुकावट समझनी चाहिये।

 ७–कार्तिक शुक्ला पञ्चमीको यदि रविवार हो तो १० विस्वा, सोमवार हो तो १२ विस्वा, मंगलवार हो तो ८ विस्वा, बुधवार हो तो १२ विस्वा, वृहस्पतिवार हो तो १८ विस्वा, शुक्रवार हो तो १६ विस्वा और शनिवार हो तो ५ विस्वा वृष्टि कहनी चाहिये।

 ८–कार्तिक शुक्ला एकादशी और द्वादशी तिथि '**अभ्रुध्रुवा**' कहलाती है। अर्थात् इन दोनों दिनों में स्वाति या विशाखा नक्षत्र पर सूर्य रहते हुये अश्विनी या रेवती अवश्य आया करती है और इस योगसे बादल भी हआ करते हैं। बादल वगैरह के होने से पूर्वोक्त गर्भ के लक्षण संपन्न हो जाते हैं। यदि किसी कारण इन दोनों दिनोंमें गर्जना न हो और बादल भी न हों तो वह वर्ष खराब समझना चाहिये।

 ९–कार्तिक शुक्ला एकादशी वा द्वादशीके दिन यदि आकाश बादलोंसे ढका हुआ हो तो आषाढमें अति वृष्टि होती है ।

 १०–कार्तिक शुक्ला द्वादशीकी रात्रि में बिजली, वर्षा, गर्जना तथा पचरंगी बादलों के होने से गर्भ का रजःपात (गिरजाना) समझना चाहिये।

 ११–कार्तिक शुक्ला द्वादशीकी रात्रि में यदि बादल न हों तथा पूर्णिमा को भी बादल न हों तो पुष्पबन्ध (गर्भ का ठहर जाना) समझना चाहिये।

 १२–कार्तिककी पूर्णिमाके दिन कृत्तिका नक्षत्र पूरी ६० घड़ी हो तो सुभिक्ष का लक्षण है। और यदि कृत्तिकाकी इस दिन वृद्धि अर्थात् दो कृत्तिका हो जाय तो वर्षा विशेष समझनी चाहिये।

 १३–कार्तिककी पूर्णिमा तिथिको भरणी नक्षत्र के ६० घड़ी के होनेसे उस वर्ष में कहीं अच्छी वृष्टि होती है और कहीं होती ही नहीं।

 १४–कार्तिककी पूर्णिमा तिथि को रोहिणी नक्षत्र के होनेसे प्रजा में चैन नहीं रहता और दुर्भिक्ष होता है।

 १५–कार्तिक मासकी तुला संक्रान्तिके दिन वर्षाके होनेसे धान्य साधारण ही पैदा होता है और पौष (कुछ) सुभिक्षता होती है।

 १६–कार्तिक मास की संक्रान्ति के आखिरी दो दिन में खूब वर्षा हो जाय तो आगे वर्षाऋतु में अच्छी वर्षा होती है।

 १७–कार्तिक मास के कृष्णपक्ष (अर्थात् प्रचलित व्यवहारसे मार्गशीर्ष कृष्ण) की चतुर्थीको मृगशीर्ष नक्षत्र हो और उस दिन वर्षा जहाँ जहाँ होजाय, वहाँ वहाँ आषाढमें अच्छी वर्षा होती है।

 १८–कार्तिक कृष्णा (मार्ग० कृ०) अष्टमीको यदि बिजलियाँ दिखाई दें तो श्रावण में वृष्टि अवश्य होगी।

 १९–मार्गशीर्ष पौष और माघमें यदि सूर्य और चन्द्रमा बर्फके गिरनेसे मैले हों, ताँबेके रंग के समान हों तो आषाढ शुक्ला सप्तमीसे तीन दिन तक वृष्टि समझनी चाहिये।

 २०–मार्गशीर्ष शुक्ला प्रतिपदाको यदि बिजली, गर्जना और वर्षा न हो तो गर्भ को संपन्न समझना ऐसा पण्डितोंका मत है।

 २१–मार्गशीर्ष शुक्ला में द्वितीयासे (११ दिन तक) गर्भ धारणके दिन हैं। इन दिनों में जिस नक्षत्र के रोज जहाँ वृष्टि हुई हो, वहाँ उसी नक्षत्र पर सूर्यके आने पर वर्षा होगी।

 जैसे मार्गशीर्ष शुक्ला चतुर्थीको पुष्यनक्षत्र हो और इस दिन यहाँ वर्षा हुई हो तो जब सूर्य इस पुष्य नक्षत्र पर आवेगा तब यहाँ वर्षा होगी। एक एक नक्षत्र पर सूर्य १३ दिन रहा करता है।

 २२–मार्गशीर्ष शुक्ला द्वितीयाको यदि दक्षिणका पवन चले और शनिवार भी होवे तो वह वर्ष मनुष्यों के लिये क्लेश देनेवाला जानना चाहिये।

 २३–मार्गशीर्ष शुक्ला दशमीको यदि सारे रात दिन उत्तरी पवन चले तो गर्भ धारण हुआ। समझना चाहिये।

 २४–मार्गशीर्ष शुक्ला दशमीको यदि बादलोंकी गर्जना होवे तो ज्येष्ठ पा श्रावणकृष्ण (प्रचलित व्यवहार से आषाढकृष्ण वा भाद्रकृष्ण) में वर्षा होती है।

 २५–मार्गशीर्ष शुक्ला द्वादशी और अमावस्या के रोज़ यदि वर्षा हो जावे तो आगे वर्षाकाल में अच्छी वर्षा होवे।

 २६–मार्गशीर्ष कृष्ण (पौषकृष्ण ) में चतुर्थी से (९ दिन तक) गर्भ धारणकी तिथियाँ हैं। इन दिनों में गर्भके पूर्वोक्त लक्षण दिखाई देने से आषाढशुक्ला में निश्चयपूर्वक वर्षा होती है।

 २७–मार्गशीर्ष कृष्ण (पौषकृष्ण) में मघानक्षत्र के दिन बिजलियों सहित काले बादलों के दिखाई देने से आषाढ शुक्ला चतुर्थी को निश्चय से वृष्टि होती है।

 २८–मार्गशीर्ष कृष्ण (पौषकृष्ण) में चतुर्थीके दिन अश्लेषा नक्षत्र के होने पर, पञ्चमी को मघा के और षष्ठीको पूर्वाफाल्गुनीके होने पर यदि पूर्वोक्त पांच प्रकारसे गर्भ धारण होवे तो आषाढ में पूर्वाफाल्गुनी नक्षत्र के आने पर तीन राततक वृष्टि होती है।

 २९–मार्गशीर्ष कृष्ण (पौ० कु०) में सप्तमीके दिन उत्तराफाल्गुनीके होने पर अष्टमीको हस्तके और नवमीको चित्राके होने पर जो गर्भ रहता है, उससे आषाढ में अष्टमीको[^2] को आया करता है ।") स्वातिनक्षत्र के आने से तीन राततक खूब वर्षा होती है।

[^2]: "यह स्वातिनक्षत्र आषाढ शुक्ला अष्टमीको कभी हो जाता है। प्रायः यह प्रतिवर्ष नवमी (भडल्या नवमी

 ३०–मार्गशीर्ष कृष्ण (पो० कृ०) सप्तमीकी अर्द्धरात्रि में गर्जना होना उत्तम है। और मार्गशीर्ष कृष्ण (पो० कृ०) अष्टमीको बिजलियाँ चमकने से श्रावण मास में वर्षा होती है।

 ३१–मार्गशीर्ष कृष्ण (पो० कृ०) अष्टमीको पूर्वकी हवासे सुभिक्ष होता है। और इसके अलावा अन्यदिशाओंकी वायुसे दुर्भिक्ष पड़ता है।

 ३२–मार्गशीर्ष कृष्ण (पो० कृ०) अष्टमीको स्वाति और चित्राके योग होने पर यदि बादल दिखाई दें तो आषाढमास में इन्हीं दोनों नक्षत्रों के दिन वर्षा होगी।

 ३३–मार्गशीर्ष कृष्ण (पौ० कृ०) सप्तमी और नवमीको यदि ईशान कोण में काले बादल खूब हों तो उस वर्ष वृष्टि या हवा कम होय।

 ३४–मार्गशीर्ष कृष्ण (पौ० कृ०) दशमी की रात्रि में वर्षा के होने से भाद्रपद मास में खूब वर्षा होती है।

 ३५–मार्गशीर्ष कृष्णा (पौष कृष्णा) में एकादशीके दिन दक्षिणका पवन घले, बादल बिजलियाँ भी होवें तो दुर्भिक्ष पड़ता है।

 ३६–मार्गशीर्ष कृष्णा (पौ० कृ०) में दशमीको चित्रानक्षत्रके, एकादशीको स्वातिके और द्वादशीको विशाखा नक्षत्रके होने पर यदि गर्भ रहे तो आषाढके महीनों में उन्हीं नक्षत्रोंके आने पर तीन राततक वृष्टि होती है।

  ३७–मार्गशीर्ष कृष्णा (पौष कृष्णा) में द्वादशी, त्रयोदशी, चतुर्दशी और अमावस्या को चौतरफी हवा के चलने से आषाढमें वर्षा होती है।

 ३८–मार्गशीर्ष कृष्णा (पौ० कृ०) में चतुर्दशी या अमावस्याको यदि सूर्य बादलों से ढका हुआ होतो धान्य की महँगाई रहे।

  ३९–मार्गशीर्ष कृष्णा(पौ० कृ०) अमावस्याको मूलनक्षत्र के होने से सस्ताई और ज्येष्ठानक्षत्र से महँगाई होती है।तथा इस दिन शनि, रवि, मंगलवार के होने से टीडियों आदि द्वारा अकाल पड़ता है।

 ४०–मार्गशीर्ष में भी संक्रान्ति-प्रवेशके दिन वर्षाके होने से साधारण धान्य पैदा होता है और पौषमास में सस्ताई रहती है।

इति मार्गशीर्षः।

 ४१–पौष में चन्द्र-गति द्वारा मूलनक्षत्रसे भरणीनक्षत्र तक पूर्वोक्त पाँच प्रकारसे गर्भ रहे तो, सूर्य की गति से आर्द्रानक्षत्र पर जब सूर्य आवे तबसे विशाखा नक्षत्र पर जावे तब तक वर्षा होती है।

 पौषमें मूलनक्षत्र (अर्थात् मूलनक्षत्र पर चन्द्रमा) प्रायः अमाको भाता है और आर्द्रा नक्षत्र पर सूर्य आषाढमें आया करता है। एवं १३ दिन तक उसी नक्षत्र पर रहता है। इस तरह प्रत्येक नक्षत्र को १३ दिन क्रम से भोगता हुआ कार्तिक में विशाखानक्षत्र पर जाता है।

 ४२–पौष शुक्ला में प्रतिपदा से दशमी तक गर्भ रह जाय तो भी चातुर्मास्यमें अच्छी वृष्टि होती है। यदि इस गर्भका चैत्र में पतन न होवे तब।

 ४३–पौष में पूर्वाषाढनक्षत्रका सूर्य यदि बादलों से ढका हुआ होवे तो भाषाढमें आर्द्रा पर जब सूर्य वे तब मूलनक्षत्र पर्य्यन्त नित्य वर्षा होय।

 ४४–रेवती के सूर्यमें अर्थात् चैत्रमें वर्षा हो जाने और रेवसीके आगे के अश्विनी आदि दश नक्षत्रों में नहीं होने तो गर्भपात समझना-यह नारद ऋषिका मत है।

 ४५–पौष शुक्ला द्वितीयाको बिजली, बादलों की घटा और पाला (बर्फ) के होने से अथवा केवल आकाशमें बादलों के आच्छादित होने से ही श्रावणका महीना सम्पन्न समझना चाहिये।

 ४६–पौष शुक्ला चतुर्थीको आकाशमें बिजली, बादलों की घटा, मत्स्य, इन्द्रधनुष वगैरह का होना उत्तम है।

 ४७–यदि उपर्युक्त तिथि में बिजली, मेघ, मत्स्य और इन्द्रधनुष वगैरह में से एक भी न होवे तो वर्षाऋतुमें अनावृष्टि समझनी चाहिये। ऐसा पडितोंने कहा है।

 ४८–पौष शुक्ला में शतभिषानक्षत्र के दिन बिजली, कालेबादल और आठों दिशाकी हवा चले तो आषाढ कृष्ण (प्रचलित व्यवहार से श्रावण कृष्ण) चतुर्थी से सात दिन तक द्रोण प्रमाण में वर्षा होय।

 ४९–पौष शुक्ला में पूर्वाभाद्रपद नक्षत्रको विशेष परीक्षा करनी चाहिये। इस दिन सूर्य चन्द्रमाकी कुण्डलना होने से, बिजली, वर्षा और गर्जना होने से वर्षा ऋतु में अच्छी वृष्टि होती है।

 ५०–पौष शुक्ला पंचमी को यदि हिम (पाला) गिरे तो वर्षा ऋतु में निःसन्देह अर्थात्मंगल आदि विरोधी ग्रह हों तो भी खूब वर्षा होती है।

 ५१–पौष शुक्ला षष्ठीको केवल बादलों के होने से श्रावण में वर्षा होती है और यदि इस दिन वृष्टि होजावे तो भाद्रपद कृष्णा अर्थात् आश्विन कृष्णा में वर्षा होगी।

 ५२–पौष शुक्ला में सप्तमी, अष्टमी और नवमी इन तिथियों में बादलों की गर्जना होने से निस्सन्देह गर्भ अच्छा समझना चाहिये।

 ५३–पौष शुक्ला में सप्तमीके दिन रेवतीनक्षत्रके, अष्टमीको अश्विनीके और नवमी को भरणी नक्षत्र के होने पर बिजली चमके, बर्फ गिरे या अच्छी हवा चले अर्थात् पूर्व, उत्तर ईशान, पश्चिमकी हवा चले तो गर्भका होना समझना चाहिये।

 ५४–पौष शुक्ला में सप्तमीके दिन रेवती नक्षत्र के और अष्टमी, नवमीको अश्विनी नक्षत्रके होने पर जलकी बूंदें, बर्फ ( पाला ) और पूर्व या उत्तरकी हवाका चलना उत्तम है।

 ५५–पौष शुक्ला एकादशीको बिजली, बर्फ और बादलों की घटा होवे और यदि इस दिन रोहिणी नक्षत्रका योग भी होवे तो उस वर्ष वृष्टि अच्छी होती है।

 ५६–पौष शुक्ला में एकादशी और नवमीको पूर्व दिशामें गर्जने वाले बादल धान्यके नाश करनेवाले होते हैं।

 ५७–पौष शुक्ला त्रयोदशीको शनि, शुक्र या मंगलवार के होने पर वर्षा हो जावे तो गेहूँ वगैरह अन्नोंका दुर्भिक्ष समझना चाहिये।

 ५८–पौष की अमावस्यामें वृष्टिके होने से आषाढमें खूब जल बरसता है और सब धान्यों की सम्पत्ति होती है तथा गायें भी दूधवाली होती हैं।

 ५९–पौष शुक्ला चतुर्दशीको बिजली दीखना उत्तम है। इससे आषाढ़ कृष्ण अर्थात्श्रावण कृष्णा में खूब जल बरसता है।

 ६०–यदि उक्त दिन में बादल सूर्य को ढककर [ऐरावत]() (लाल रंग का लंबा इन्द्रधनुषकी तरह ९ चिन्ह) से युक्त होकर गर्जना करे तथा बिजलियाँ भी चमकें तो गर्भ श्रेष्ठ समझना चाहिये।

 ६१–यदि उक्त दिन में उत्तर दिशा की तरफ सुनहरी बिजली दिखाई देवे तो उसे शीघ्र ही बहुत मेघ आने वाला समझना चाहिये।

 ६२-६३–पूर्व दिशा की बिजली वर्षा करनेवाली, अग्निकोणकी वर्षा रोकनेवाली, दक्षिण कीकम फल वाली, नैऋत्यकोणकी जल नाश करनेवाली, पश्चिमकी धान्य पैदा करनेवाली, वायुकोणकी हवा चलने वाली, उत्तरकी शीघ्र ही जल बरसानेवाली और ईशानकोण की सदा ही उत्तम होती है।

 ६४–जिस देश में सुभिक्ष होने वाला है, उसी देशकी तरफ बिजली जावेगी। यह सब बिजलीके लक्षण केवल पौष शुक्ला चतुर्दशीके समझने चाहिए।

—————————————————————————————————————————

\*"एतदिन्द्र धनुर्वक्रं तदेव ऋजु रोहितम् । ऐरावतं च तत्प्रोक्तं फलमस्य धनुःसमम्" इति।

 ६५-६६–पौषमास की पूर्णिमाको बादलों के कारण चन्द्रमा नहीं दीखे और उत्तर तथा दक्षिण दिशा में बिजलियाँ चमकें और आकाश भी खूब बादलों से घिरा हुआ हो तो यह जल बरसाने का उत्तम योग है। इससे श्रावणकी अमावस्यामें अत्यन्त वर्षा होती है।

 ६७–पौषकी पूर्णिमाको बिजली चमके या वर्फे (पाली) गिरे अथवा केवल आकाशमें खूब बादल ही हों तो आषाढ में अमावस्या के दिन वर्षा होती है।

 ६८–पौषके महीनेमें यदि गर्भके कुछ भी चिन्ह दिखाई न दें तो वर्षा ऋतु में वर्षाका सर्वथा अभाव होता है यह ज्योतिषियों का मत है।

 ६९–पौष कृष्णा (प्रचलित व्यवहार से माघ कृष्णा) पश्चमी को मंगलवार हो और उस दिन वर्षा भी होजावे तो उस वर्ष खूब धान्य पैदा होता है।

 ७०–पौषकृष्णा (मा० कृ०) पञ्चमीकी रात्रिके आकाशमें यदि स्वच्छ तारे निकले हों और स्वाति नक्षत्र के दिन पाला गिरा हो तो आवरण के महीने में स्वाति नक्षत्र के दिन वर्षा समझनी चाहिये। इस दिन स्वातिनक्षत्र प्रायः आया ही करता है।

 ७१–पौष कृष्णा (मा० कृ०) सप्तमीकी आधीरातमें वर्षा होने से वर्षाऋतुमें मेघ खूत्र गर्जता और बरसता है।

 ७२–पौष कृष्णा (मा० कृ०) सप्तमीको स्वातिनक्षत्रका आना सुभिक्षकारी है। इस दिन केवल बादलों के होने से वर्षाऋतु में वृष्टि कम होती है और वर्षा होने से खूब वृष्टि होती है।

 ७३–पौष कृष्णा (मा० कृ०) सप्तमीको स्वातिनक्षत्रका योग श्राने पर पाला गिरे और गर्जना हो तो प्रजाको धान्यसे अच्छा सुख मिले।

 ७४–पौष कृष्णा (मा० कृ०) सप्तमीको केवल स्वातिनक्षत्र के भी होने से सब जगह सुभिक्ष और कुशलता होती है।

 ७५–पौष कृष्णा (मा० कृ०) सप्तमीको वृष्टि और चौतरफी हवा के चलने से श्रावणशुक्ला सप्तमीको स्वाति नक्षत्र के रहने पर अच्छी वर्षा होती है।

(इस दिन चित्रा, स्वाति या विशाखा इन में से कोई अवश्य रहता है।)

 ७६–पौष कृष्णा (माघकृष्णा) अष्टमीकी आधीरातमें गर्जना होने से चातुर्मास्य में

(आर्द्रा नक्षत्र पर जब सूर्य आवे तब से ४ मास तक) अच्छी वर्षा होती है। इस तरह ज्यौतिषी कहते हैं।

 ७७–पौष कृष्णा (मा० कृ०) अष्टमीको वृष्टिके न होने से, आर्द्रा पर सूर्य आवि तब महावृष्टि होती है।

 ७८–पौष कृष्णा (मा० कृ०) दशमीको गर्जना होने से श्रावण शुक्ला दशमीको वृष्टि होती है।

 ७९–पौष कृष्णा (मा० कृ०) दशमीको रात या दिन में विशाखानक्षत्र के होने से, यह वर्षाऋतुमें जल बरसाने वाला उत्तम योग कहा गया है।

 ८०–पौष कृष्णा (मा० कृ०) दशमीको बिजलियाँ और बादलों की खूब घटा होने से भाद्रपदकी पूर्णिमा में वृष्टि होती है।

 ८१–पौष कृष्णा (मा० कृ०) त्रयोदशी, चतुर्दशी और अमावस्या को बादलों की घटा और बिजलियों के होने से श्रावण में वर्षा होती है।

 ८२–पौष कृष्णा (मा० कृ०) अमावस्या को पूर्व दिशा में बिजलियाँ हों या पाला गिरे तो श्रावणकी पूर्णिमामें अच्छी वर्षा होय।

 ८३–पौष कृष्णा (मा० कृ०) अमावस्या को शनिवार, रविवार या मंगलवारके होने से धान्य क्रम से दुगुना, तिगुना और चौगुना महंगा होजाता है।

 ८४–पौषक अमावस्या तिथिकी धडियों के चार हिस्से करके उनमें क्रमसे आषाढ, श्रावण, भाद्रपद और आश्विन मासको कल्पना करे। इन महीनों की कल्पना किई हुई जिन धड़ियों में जैसी वर्षा या बादल वगैरह हों वैसा ही फल उन महीनों का कहना चाहिए।

 ८५–पौष के ३० दिनों में २॥ दिनके हिसाबसेपौषसे प्रारंभ करमार्गशीर्ष तक के १२महीनों को कल्पना करनी चाहिये।इस कल्पनामें जिस महीनेकी तिथिकोजैसी वर्षा वगैरह हो वह ही फल उन १२ महीनों का समझना चाहिये।

 जैसे पौष शुक्ल प्रतिपदा से २॥ दिन अर्थात् तृतीया तिथिके १२ बजे तक पौषमास की कल्पना इसके बाद २॥ दिन अर्थात् षष्ठी तिथि तक माघके महीने की कल्पना होती है। इस तरह १२ महीनों की कल्पना करनी चाहिये।

 ८६-८७–पौष में संक्रान्ति के दिन रवि, शनि या मंगलवार के होने से धान्य क्रम से दूना, तिगुना और चौगुना महँगा होजाता है। और बुध या शुक्रवार से समानता, वृहस्पति या चन्द्रवार से आधा मूल्य होजाता है। इस तरह वारों के क्रम से कई मनुष्य धान्य का फल कहते हैं।

 ८८–माघ में मूल नक्षत्र से भरणीनक्षत्र पर्यन्त बिजली, गर्जना, पूर्व या उत्तर की वायु और बादलों के होने से आर्द्रा पर सूर्य आवे तब से विशाखा पर जावे तब तक वर्षा होय।

 अर्थात् मूल को उक्त लक्षण दिखाई दें तो आर्द्रा के १३ दिनों में पूर्वाषाढ को दीखें तो पूनर्वसु के १३ दिनों में इस तरह मूलादि भरणी पर्यन्त के ११ नक्षत्रों में वर्षा, बिजली आदि चिन्हों से आर्द्रा, विशाखादि ११ नक्षत्र तक सूर्य रहे तब तक वर्षा होय । सूर्य एक एक नक्षत्र पर १३ दिन रहा करता है।

 ८९–माघ शुक्ला प्रतिपदा को केवल वायु और बादल हुए भी हों किन्तु जल न बरसे तो तेल और गन्धवाली चीजें महँगी हो जाती हैं।

 ९०–माघ शुक्ला द्वितीया को बादल और बिजलियाँ होवें तथा तृतीया को केवल गर्जना ही होवे तो धान्य महँगा होता है।

 ९१–माघ शुक्ला चतुर्थी को वर्षा होजाय अथवा केवल बादल ही हों तो भी ताम्बूल (पान) और नारियल (खोपरा) वगैरह महँगे होंगे।

 ९२–माघ शुक्ला पञ्चमी को बादलों के होने पर भी यदि वर्षा न होवे तो भाद्रपद में वर्षा कम होती है और यदि इस दिन उत्तर दिशा की हवा चलती हो तो वर्षा का अभाव समझना चाहिये।

 ९३–माघ शुक्ला षष्ठी को सोमवार होने पर भी यदि बादलों में गर्जना न होवे तो कपास वगैरह महँगे होवें।

 ९४–माघ शुक्ला सप्तमी को घड़ियों के चार विभाग करें और उनमें चातुर्मास्य की क्रमशः कल्पना करके जिस घड़ी में जैसी वर्षा या मेघघटा वगैरह दिखाई दें वही फल उन उन महीनों का कहना चाहिये।

 ९५–माघ शुक्ला सप्तमी को सोमवार के होने से दुर्भिक्ष पड़ता है और यदि उसमें सूर्य भी निर्मल दिखाई दे अर्थात् बादल वगैरह नहीं हो तो अनावृष्टि समझनी चाहिए।

 ९६–माघ शुक्ला सप्तमी को वृष्टि के होने से आषाढ में अतिवृष्टि होती है। और ज्येष्ठ में मूलनक्षत्र के दिन सूर्य के खूब तपने पर सुभिक्ष होता है।

 ९७–माघ शुक्ला सप्तमी को बिजली, बर्षा और बादलों की खूब घटा के होने से वर्षा ऋतु में अच्छी वृष्टि होती है।

 ९८–माघ शुक्ला सप्तमी को और चैत्र शुक्ला तृतीया को एक ही बार के होने से उस वर्ष धान्य वगैरह में रोली लग जाती है अर्थात् वह नष्ट हो जाता है।

 ९९-माघ शुक्ला में सूर्यास्त के बाद सप्तमी को बादलों का होना खराब, अष्टमी को उत्तम और नवमी को मामूली है।

 १००–उक्त तिथियों में रात दिन बादल हुए रहें, पूर्व या उत्तर की हवा चलती रहे और पश्चिम दिशा में बिजली चमकती रहे तो वर्षा ऋतु में अतिवृष्टि समझनी चाहिये।

 १०१–माघ शुक्ला सप्तमी को बादल न होने से और अष्टमी को होने से आषाढ में वर्षा न होकर श्रावण में होती है।

 १०२–माघ शुक्ल अष्टमी को सूर्य बादलों से ढका हो और रात्रि में चन्द्रमा साफ दीखता हो अर्थात् बादल न हों तो यह दुर्भिक्ष का लक्षण समझना चाहिये।

 १०३–माघ में भरणी और कृत्तिकानक्षत्र के दिन की विशेष परीक्षा करनी चाहिये। इन दिनों में बादलों के होने से धान्य की उत्पत्ति और न होने से धान्य की हानि होती है।

 १०४–माघ शुक्ला अष्टमी को यदि कृत्तिकानक्षत्र भाजावे तो फाल्गुन में धान्य पर रोली लगे अथवा श्रावण में वर्षा का अभाव होता है।

 १०५–माघ शुक्ला अष्टमी को सूर्योदय के समय बादल न होने से आर्द्रा नक्षत्र पर सूर्य आवे और श्रावण के अन्त में अर्थात् पुनर्वसु नक्षत्र पर सूर्य आवे तब वर्षा नहीं होती है।

 १०६–माघ शुक्ल नवमी की रात्रि में चन्द्रमा के कुण्डलना (चौतरफी चक्र) होने से संपूर्ण आषाढ में और अश्विन में वर्षा होती है।

 यहाँ पर किसी का मत है कि उक्त तिथि में चन्द्रमा के कुण्डलना होने से आषाढ और आश्विन में वर्षा का अभाव होता है। अतः परीक्षा करके इसका निर्णय करना चाहिये।

 १०७–माघ शुक्ला नवमी को प्रातःकाल अष्टमी तिथि का मेल होवे तो, आर्द्रानक्षत्र पर सूर्य के आने से आषाढ और श्रावण में वर्षा नहीं होती।

 १०८–माघ शुक्ला नवमी को दिन भर बादल न हों और केवल इसके चौथे प्रहर में ही बादल दिखाई देवें तो भाद्रपद में वृष्टि समझनी चाहिये।

 १०९–माघ शुक्ला नवमी को रात दिन कहीं पर भी बादल न हों तो उस वर्ष समुद्र के अतिरिक्त कहीं पर भी जल नहीं मिले। अर्थात् उस वर्ष सर्वथा दी दृष्टि का अभाव हो।

 ११०–माघ शुक्ला दशमी को वर्षा होय और नवमी को वर्षा नहीं भी होवे तो उस वर्ष वर्षा ऋतु अत्यन्त आनन्द देने वाली होती है। वर्षा की प्रतीक्षा करने का समय ही नहीं आता।

 १११–माघ शुक्ला नवमी को रात दिन बादलों की घटा रहने से भाद्रपद में निस्संदेह अति वृष्टि होती है।

 ११२–माघ शुक्ला सप्तमी से आठ दिन तक बादलों के होने से उस वर्ष अतिवृष्टि और न होने से अनावृष्टि होती है।

 ११३–माघ की पूर्णिमा को चन्द्रमा के कुण्डलना का होना, उत्तर और दक्षिण की बिजलियां होना, खराब दिशा (नैऋत्य) की हवा का चलना तथा बादलों का होना-ये सब लक्षण खराब हैं।

 ११४–माघ की पूर्णिमा के प्रहरों में वर्षाऋतु के चारों महीनों की भावना करे। जिस प्रहर में बादल दिखाई दें उस प्रहर में कल्पना किये हुए मास में अनावृष्टि होती है।

 ११५–माघकृष्णा (प्रचलित व्यवहार से फाल्गुन कृष्णा) द्वितीया को बिजलियाँ और बादलों के होने से श्रावण तथा भाद्रपद में वर्षा होती है और सुभिक्ष होता है।

 ११६–माघकृष्णा (फा० कृ०) षष्ठी को चित्रानक्षत्र के आने पर यदि आकाश में बादल दिखाई दें तो आर्द्रा के सूर्य में निस्सन्देह वर्षा होती है।

 ११७–माघकृष्णा (फा० कृ०) सप्तमी को स्वाति नक्षत्र के आने पर बिजली, बादलों की घटा और पाला गिरने से तथा प्रचण्ड (विशेष) हवा के चलने से वर्षाकाल में अच्छी वृष्टि होती है।

 ११८–माघकृष्णा (फा० कृ०) नवमी को रविवार और मूलनक्षत्र के होने से भाद्रपद शुक्ला नवमी को निश्चय वर्षा होती है।

 ११९–माघकृष्णा (फा० कृ०) नवमी को मूलनक्षत्र के रहते हुए बिजली, बादलों की घटा और इन्द्रधनुष के होने से आषाढ और भाद्रपद शुक्ला नवमी तथा दशमी को वर्षा होती है।

 १२०–माघकृष्णा (फा० कृ०) नवमी, दशमी और एकादशी को बिजली, जोर की हवा और बादलों की घटा के होने से अतिवृष्टि होती है।

 १२१–माघकृष्णा (फा० कृ०) सप्तमी और त्रयोदशी को पूर्व दिशा में बादलों के होने से आषाढ में सात रात तक लगातार वर्षा होती है।

 १२२–माघकृष्णा (फा० कृ०) चतुर्दशी अर्थात् शिवरात्रि को रातदिन पाला गिरने से और उत्तर की हवा के चलने से सुभिक्ष समझना चाहिए।

 १२३–माघकृष्णा (फा० कृ०) अमावास्या को हवा की तरह रातदिन पाला पड़ने से और बादलों के छाये रहने से भाद्रपद की पूर्णिमा में वर्षा होती है।

 १२४–माघ मास में (मकर) संक्रान्ति के दिन वर्षा के होने से पृथ्वी में खूब धान्य पैदा होता है और गायें भी खूब दूध वाली होती हैं।

 १२५–फाल्गुन में नित्य बादल होते हों और जल न बरसे तो गर्भ सम्पन्न समझना चाहिये। इससे वर्षाऋतु में अच्छी वृष्टि होती है।

 १२६–फाल्गुनशुक्ला प्रतिपदा को शतभिषानक्षत्र का होना श्रेष्ठ हैं। इस दिन जितनी ज्यादह शतभिषा होय उतनी ही वर्षा समझनी चाहिये।

 १२७–फाल्गुन शुक्ला सप्तमी को एक द्रोण वर्षा के होने से भाद्रपद कृष्णा अर्थात् प्रचलित व्यवहार से आश्विन कृष्णा पञ्चमी को अतिवृष्टि होती है।

 १२८–फाल्गुनशुक्ला सप्तमी को कृत्तिकानक्षत्र के अष्टमी को रोहिणी के और नवमी को मृगशिर के होने पर यदि गर्जना होवे तो भाद्रपदकृष्णा अर्थात् आश्विनकृष्णा अमावास्या को वर्षा होती है।

 १२९–फाल्गुनशुक्ला सप्तमी या अष्टमी को रोहिणी नक्षत्र का होना श्रेष्ठ और नवमी को अथवा दशमी को होना खराब है। नवमी को होने से तृण का और दशमी को होने से धान्य का नाश होता है।

 १३०– कुम्भसंक्रान्ति से मीन संक्रान्ति के बीच के समय में अष्टमी को रोहिणी नक्षत्र के होने से वर्षा कम, नवमी को होने से वर्षा मध्यम और दशमी को होने से अधिक वर्षा होती हैं।

 १३१–फाल्गुनशुक्ला दशमी और एकादशी के दिन बादल होने से आश्विन में चतुर्थी और पञ्चमी के दिन अच्छी वर्षा होती है।

 १३२–फाल्गुनशुक्ला सप्तमी और पूर्णिमा के दिन बिना जल के (सफेद) बादल हों, विशेष हवा न चलती हो तथा बिजलियाँ भी हों तो सुभिच समझना चाहिये।

 १३३–फाल्गुन की पूर्णिमा में चन्द्रग्रहण होने से, इससे आठवें मास (कार्त्तिक) में सब धान्य महँगे होजाते है।

 १३४–फाल्गुन की पूर्णिमा को होलीदाह के समय बिजलियों और बादलों की घटा होने से गेहूँ वगैरह धान्य में रोली लग जाती है। अर्थात् नष्ट होजाते हैं।

 १३५-१३६–होलीदाह के समय बिलकुल हवा का बन्द होजाना खराब है, किन्तु इस समय पूर्व की वायु से खण्डवृष्टि, अग्निकोण की से वह्निकाडर, दक्षिण की से धान्य का नाश, नैऋत्यकोण की से पलायन (किसी आपत्ति के कारण भाग-दौड़ अर्थात् अपने स्थान का त्याग), पश्चिम की से सुभिक्ष, वायुकोण की से हवा की अधिकता, उत्तर की से अधिक वर्षा, ईशानकोण की से प्रजा को सुख और ऊपर की वायु से लढाई होती है तथा चौतरफी हवा चलने से सर्वनाश होजाता है।

 १३७–फाल्गुन शुक्ला पूर्णिमा को दिनभर पूर्व की हवा से अतिवृष्टि, उत्तर की से धान्य की उत्पत्ति, पश्चिम की से मध्यम (मामूली) वृष्टि और दक्षिण की हवा से दुर्भिक्ष पड़ता है।

 १३८–फाल्गुन की पूर्णिमा के दिन शनि, शुक्र या मंगलवार के होने से प्रजा को कई आपत्तियों के द्वारा दुःख प्राप्त होता है।

 १३९–होली की रात्रि की समाप्ति पर अर्थात् प्रचलित व्यवहार से चैत्रकृष्णा प्रतिपदा को प्रातःकाल चन्द्रमा के अस्त होने से पहले सूर्योदय होना श्रेष्ठ, साथ में होना मध्यम और पीछे उदय होना खराब है।

 १४०–फाल्गुनकृष्णा (प्रचलित मत से चैत्रकृष्णा) द्वितीया को बिजली और बादल वगैरह के न होने से श्रावण और भाद्रपद में अच्छी वर्षा होती है।

 १४१–फाल्गुनकृष्णा (चै० कृ०) द्वितीया को बादलों के न होने से और चौतरफी हवा के चलने से निस्सन्देह भाद्रपद में अच्छी वर्षा होती है।

 १४२–फाल्गुनकृष्णा (चै० कृ०) द्वितीया को खूब बादलों की घटा होने से तथा जल बरस जाने से कार्तिक में वर्षा होती हैं।

 १४३–फाल्गुनकृष्णा (चै० कृ०) तृतीया को पूर्व और उत्तर की वायु से वर्षा होती है तथा इसी चतुर्थी को वर्षा होने से दुर्भिक्ष पड़ता है।

 १४४–फाल्गुनकृष्णा (चै० कृ०) पञ्चमी को हस्तनक्षत्र के रहते हुऐ बादल, बिजली और गर्जना न होवे तो संवत्सर उत्तम समझना चाहिये।

 १४५–तथा इसी फाल्गुनकृष्णा (चै० कृ०) पञ्चमी को स्वाति नक्षत्र के भी रहते हुए बादल, बिजली और गर्जना न होवे तो संवत्सर उत्तम समझना चाहिये।

 १४६–फाल्गुनकृष्णा (चैत्रकृष्णा) पञ्चमी, नवमी और त्रयोदशी को बिजली होने से गर्भ का लक्षण दिखाई दे तो वर्षा में हानि होती है।

 १४७–फाल्गुन कृष्णा (चै० कृ०) अष्टमी और अमावास्या को वर्षा के होने से धान्य की संपत्ति द्वारा सुभिक्ष होता है।

 १४८–फाल्गुन मास में भी मूलनक्षत्र से भरणी नक्षत्र तक के दिनों की परीक्षा करनी चाहिये। यदि इन दिनों में जल बरस जावे तो वर्षाऋतु में भी जल बरसे और यदि नहीं बरसे तो वर्षाऋतु में जल का अभाव समझना चाहिए।

 १४९–फाल्गुनकृष्णा (चै० कृ०) अमावास्या को मंगलवार के होने से वर्षाऋतु में जम नहीं बरसता है। इसलिये उस वर्ष धान्य संग्रह करलेना ही अच्छा है।

 १५०–फाल्गुन में संक्रान्ति के दिन यदि वर्षा होजावे तो वैशाख और ज्येष्ठ मास में धान्य में अच्छी विचित्रता होजाती है अर्थात् खूब पैदा होता है।

 १५१–फाल्गुन में बृहस्पति के अस्त या वक्र होजाने से तथा शनि के वक्र होजाने से धान्य की महँगाई रहती है।

 १५२–फाल्गुन में शुक्र के अस्त होने से छः महीने तक दुर्भिक्ष रहता है और शनि तथा मंगल के वक्र होने से एक पक्ष (१५ दिन) तक दुर्भिक्ष रहता है।

इति फाल्गुनः।

 १५३–चैत्र में रेवती नक्षत्र पर सूर्य के रहते हुए तेरह दिनों में जहाँ जहाँ पवन, बादल और बिजलियाँ हों वहाँ पर गर्भ अच्छा समझना चाहिये।

 १५४–मेष संक्रान्ति से नौ दिन तक जिन जिन दिनों में बादल, पवन और बिजलियाँ हों उन दिनों के क्रम से आर्द्रानक्षत्र पर जब सूर्य आवे तब से, चित्रानक्षत्र पर सूर्य जाय तब तक अच्छी वर्षा होती है। अर्थात् मेष संक्रान्ति के पहिले दिन उपर्युक्त गर्भ के लक्षण जहाँ दिखाई दें वहाँ आर्द्रा नक्षत्र पर सूर्य आने से (आषाढ में) वर्षा होती है और मेष संक्रान्ति के दूसरे दिन दिखाई दें तो पुनर्वसु पर सूर्य के आने से वर्षा होती है। इत्यादि।

 १५५–चैत्र में जिस समय संक्रान्ति लगे उस प्रहर से नौ प्रहर तक क्रम से अश्विनी आदि नौ नक्षत्रों की गणना करके जिस प्रहर में जिस जिस दिशा में वायु आदि से गर्भ के लक्षण दिखाई दें वहाँ उन्हीं सौर नक्षत्रों के आने से वृष्टि कहनी चाहिये।

 १५६–चैत्र में अश्विनी से मघा तक के दश नक्षत्रों के दिनों में बादल आदि गर्भ के लक्षण दिखाई दें तो गर्भ सम्पन्न हुआ समझना।

 १५७–चैत्र शुक्ला प्रतिपदा से दशमी तक वर्षा न होय तो कार्तिक से माघ तक का गर्भ स्थिर समझना चाहिये। और यदि अतिवृष्टि होवे तो गर्भपात समझना चाहिये।

 १५८–चैत्र शुक्ला प्रतिपदा से अष्टमी तक यदि वर्षा होजाय और नवमी के दिन बिजली चमके तो उस देश में वृष्टि नहीं होगी।

 १५९–चैत्र शुक्ला प्रतिपदा से दशमी तक की तिथियाँ आषाढ से दश पक्षों की अर्थात् पाँच महीनों की साक्षी समझनी चाहिये इन दश दिनों में गर्भपात की परीक्षा करनी चाहिये।

 १६०–गर्भ के साक्षीभूत उपरिलिखित दश दिनों के घटिकात्मक चार विभाग (अर्थात् २॥२॥दिन के) करके उन में एक-एक दिन की कल्पना करनी चाहिये (इन चार दिनों को वर्षाकाल के चार मास माने हैं) जिस दिन के विभाग में गर्भपात होजाय उसी मास में अवृष्टि समझनी चाहिये।

 १६१–चैत्र शुक्ला में आर्द्रा से स्वातिनक्षत्र तक बादल रहे लेकिन जल न बरसे तो संवत्सर उत्तम समझना चाहिये।

 १६२–चैत्र शुक्ला प्रतिपदा को तिथि बढने से घास बढ़ता है। नक्षत्र बढ़ने से धान्य की वृद्धि होती है और योग के बढ़ने से रोग बढ़ता है।

 १६३–चैत्र शुक्ला प्रतिपदा को यदि रविवार हो तो अनावृष्टि होगी, मंगलवार होवे तो अच्छी वृष्टि होगी और बुधवार के होने से दुर्भिक्ष होता है।

 १६४-१६५–अब मतान्तर कहते हैं। चैत्र शुक्ला प्रतिपदा को रविवार होने से जल और धान्य की कमी होती है तथा वायु अधिक चलती है, चन्द्रवार के होने से जल, धान्य और घास खूब पैदा होता है, मंगलवार के होने से ६ प्रकार की ईतियाँ[^6] होती हैं, बुधवार से दुर्भिक्ष पड़ता है, बृहस्पति या शुक्रवार के होने से सुभित होता है और शनिवार के होने से जल वगैरह का नाश होता है।

[^6]: "अतिवृष्टिरनावृष्टिर्मूषिकाः शलभाशुकाः। अध्यासन्नाश्च राजानः षड़ेता ईतयः स्मृताः॥इति कामन्दकः।"

 १६६–चैत्र शुक्ला प्रतिपदा को यदि गर्जना हो और वर्षा भी हो तो श्रावण के महीने में उसी नक्षत्र पर वर्षा होगी जिस नक्षत्र को चैत्र शुक्ला प्रतिपदा होगी।

 १६७–चैत्र शुक्ला द्वितीया को पूर्व की वायु का होना और बादलों का न होना भाद्रपद की वर्षा के लिये उत्तम है। तथा तृतीया को बादलों का होना और गर्जन होना सुभिक्ष के सूचक हैंI

 १६८–चैत्र शुक्ला तृतीया को दक्षिण का पवन चले और बादल पूर्व की तरफ जायँ तो आश्विन में वृष्टि होगी।

 १६९–चैत्र शुक्ला चतुर्थी को उत्तर दिशा की हवा चले और बादल नहीं होय तो कार्तिक में उसी चतुर्थी को वृष्टि होगी।

 १७०–चैत्र शुक्ला चतुर्थी को यदि जल की बूंदें गिर जायँ तो अनावृष्टि से उस वर्ष में घोर दुर्भिक्ष पड़े।

 १७१–चैत्र शुक्ला चतुर्थी को यदि बादल खूब होय तोभी अनावृष्टि से उस वर्ष में भारी दुर्भिक्ष पड़े।

 १७२–चैत्र शुक्ला प्रतिपदा, द्वितीया, तृतीया और चतुर्थी को यदि गर्भ के लक्षण होवें तो चातुर्मास्य अच्छा समझना चाहिये।

 १७३–चैत्र शुक्ला पञ्चमी को रोहिणी नक्षत्र का होना श्रेष्ठ है। यदि उस दिन आकाश में बादल हो जाय तो गर्भ सम्पन्न समझना।

 १७४–चैत्र शुक्ला पञ्चमी को आर्द्रानक्षत्र के होने से आषाढ तक दुर्भिक्ष रहे और श्रावण में वर्षा होय।

 १७५–चैत्र शुक्ला पंचमी को सूर्योदय से सूर्यास्त तक बादलों से प्रकाश घिरा रहे तो श्रावण में बड़ी महँगाई होती है।

 १७६–चैत्र शुक्ला पंचमी को दक्षिण और पूर्व की हवा चलने से और साथ ही में वृष्टि के होने से धान्य महँगा रहता है।

 १७७–चैत्र शुक्ला पंचमी और तृतीया को पूर्व और उत्तर की वायु चले तो वृष्टि अच्छी होय और धान्य भी सस्ते हैं।

 १७८–चैत्र के शुक्ल पक्ष के किसी भी दो दिनों में यदि लगातार दक्षिण और पश्चिम का पवन चलता रहे तो उस वर्ष में धान्य पैदा नहीं होगा और दुर्भिक्ष पड़ेगा।

 १७९–चैत्र शुक्ला सप्तमी को आर्द्रानक्षत्र के होते हुए यदि वर्षा होगई तो श्रावण में वृष्टि नहीं होगी ऐसा ज्योतिषी कहते हैं।

 १८०–चैत्र शुक्ला सप्तमी को यदि आकाश बादलों से घेरघुमेर रहेतो श्रावण में गेहूं की फसल से तिगुना लाभ कहना चाहिये ।

 १८१–चैत्र शुक्ला में पंचमी, सप्तमी और त्रयोदशी को वर्षा होने से या बिजली चमक ने से अथवा गर्जने तक से भी चातुर्म्मास्य की वर्षा का नाश हो जाता है।

 १८२–चैत्र शुक्ल में चन्द्रमा से यदि रोहिणी उत्तर की तरफ हो तो सुभिक्ष समझना और यदि दक्षिण की तरफ होवे तो रोग पीड़ा होवे तथा आगे की तरफ होवे एवं पीछे की तरफ होने से दुर्भिक्ष पड़े।

 १८३–चैत्र शुक्ला पञ्चमी को यदि रात दिनरोहिणी नक्षत्र रहै और आकाश में बादल रहै तो गर्भ परिपूर्ण समझना। अर्थात् गर्भ में कोईविकार नहीं हुआ और प्रसव के महीनों में अवश्य अच्छी वर्षा होगी।

 १८४–चैत्र शुक्ला पञ्चमी को आर्द्रानक्षत्र के होने से आषाढ तक दुर्भिक्ष रहता है और श्रावण में वृष्टि होती है।

 १८५–चैत्र शुक्ला पञ्चमी को सूर्योदय से सूर्यास्त तक यदि प्रकाश में बादल छाये रहें तो श्रावण में दुर्भिक्ष पड़े।

 १८६–चैत्र शुक्ला पञ्चमी को दक्षिण, पूर्व की वायु चले ओर साथही में वर्षा भी होजावे तो दुर्भिक्ष समझना चाहिये।

 १८७–चैत्र शुक्ला में पञ्चमी के दिन रोहिणीनक्षत्र हो, सप्तमी को श्रर्द्रा हो, नवमी को पुष्य हो और पूर्णिमा को चित्रा हो एव बादल न हो तो चातुर्मास्य में अच्छी वर्षा का योग होता है।

 १८८–उपर्युक्त यही (पंचमी, सप्तमी, नवमी और पूर्णिमा) चारों तिथियाँ यदि गल जाँय अर्थात् इन चारों दिनों में वर्षा होजाय तो ये इस गर्भस्राव के कारण क्रमसे आषाढ श्रावण, भाद्रपद और आश्विन की वर्षा को नष्ट करती हैं।

 १८९–इन में किसी का यह मत है कि–इस चैत्र शुक्ला पंचमी की वृष्टि से श्रावण की वर्षा नष्ट होती है, सप्तमी की वर्षा से भाद्रपद की वर्षा, नवमी की वर्षा से आश्विन की वर्षा और पूर्णिमा की वर्षा से कार्तिक की वृष्टि नष्ट होजाती है। यह मत श्रावण से कार्तिक तक वर्षाकाल मानने वालों का समझना।

 १९०–चैत्र में यही उपर्युक्त चारों तिथियाँ गर्भ की पुष्टि और हानि करने वाली हैं। यदि इन दिनों में वर्षा न हुई अर्थात् गर्भस्राव न हुआ तो निश्चय अच्छी वर्षा होगी।

 १९१-१९२–चैत्र शुक्ला पंचमी, सप्तमी, नवमी, एकादशी, त्रयोदशी और पूर्णिमा इन तिथियों में वर्षा होने से वा ओले गिरने से वा बिजली चमक ने से अथवा गर्जने तक से भी वर्षाकाल में वृष्टि समय पाकर के ही होती है अर्थात् बहुत कम वृष्टि होती है।

 १९३–चैत्र शुक्ला दशमी को मघानक्षत्र के होने से वर्षाकाल में अच्छी वृष्टि और सुभिक्ष होगा, यदि इस दिन शनिवार हो तो विशेष फल समझना चाहिये।

 १९४–चैत्र शुक्ला त्रयोदशी को आकाश के गदले रहने से वर्षाकाल में वर्षा नहीं होती है। यदि चैत्र की पूर्णिमा को चित्रानक्षत्र होवे तो आश्विन में वर्षा नहीं होगी।

 १९५–चैत्र की पूर्णिमा के रोज स्वातीनक्षत्र हो, और बिजलियाँ हों तो पहले के चित्रानक्षत्र के निर्दोष रहते हुए भी इस गर्भ को नष्ट हुआ समझना चाहिये।

 १९६–चैत्र की पूर्णिमा को गुरुवार, सोमवार और बुधवार के अतिरिक्त अन्यवार का होना खराब है। यदि चैत्र की पूर्णिमा में प्रतिपदा का प्रवेश होजाय तो वृष्टि का योग समझना चाहिये।

 १९७–चैत्र कृष्णा (वर्त्तमान हिसाब से वैशाखकृष्णा) प्रतिपदा तिथि के क्षय होने से जल की कमी होती है, समान रहने से नीरोगता रहती है और बढ़ जाने से खूब जल बरसता है। यही इस तिथि को होने वाले नक्षत्र का फल समझना चाहिए।

 १९८–चैत्र कृष्णा (वैशाख कृष्णा) प्रतिपदा को यदि सूर्य बादलों के होने के कारण न दिखाई दे तो वर्षाकाल उत्तम समझना चाहिए।

 १९९–चैत्र कृष्णा (वै० कृ०) द्वितीया को चौतरफी हवा चले तथा आकाश में बादल न हो तो भाद्रपद में अधिक वृष्टि कहनी चाहिये।

 २००–चैत्र कृष्णा (वै० कृ०) तृतीया को यदि हवा पूर्व या उत्तर दिशा की चले तो वर्षाकाल में खूब जल बरसे तथा सुभिक्ष रहे।

 २०१–चैत्रकृष्णा (वै० कृ०) चतुर्थी की वर्षा दुर्भिक्ष करने वाली है। चैत्र कृष्णा (वै० कृ०) पंचमी को हस्तनक्षत्र के रहते हुए यदि बादल न हों तो वह वर्ष श्रेष्ठ समझना।

 २०२–चैत्र कृष्णा (वै० कृ) द्वितीया, तृतीया, चतुर्थी और पंचमी को यदि वृष्टि के सहित पूर्व दिशा की हवा हो तो भी वर्षाकाल में वर्षा को नष्ट करती है।

 २०३–चैत्र में पाँच रविवार के होने से दुर्भिक्ष समझना तथा पाँच शनिवार के होने से मारी पड़ती है।

 २०४–चैत्र कृष्णा (वै० कृ०) में भी प्रारंभ में मूलनक्षत्र को तथा अन्त में भरणीनक्षत्र को देखना चाहिए। यदि इन दिनों में वर्षा होगई तो वर्षाकाल में वर्षा का अभाव तथा इन दिनों में वर्षा न हुई तो वर्षाकाल में खूब वर्षा समझनी चाहिये।

 २०५–चैत्र कृष्णा (वै० कृ०) में मूलनक्षत्र से लेकर भरणीनक्षत्र तक दक्षिण दिशा की जितनी हवा चले उतनी ही वर्षाकाल में वृष्टि का जोर समझना।

 २०६–चैत्र कृष्णा (वै० कृ०) में दक्षिण की हवा मेघ वर्षाने वाली है किन्तु यदि बादल होगये तो वृष्टि का नाश है और यदि बादल न हुए तो अच्छी वृष्टि होगी।

 २०७–चैत्र कृष्णा (वै० कृ०) पश्चमी से लेकर नौ दिन तक यदि बादल न होय तो आर्द्रानक्षत्र पर जब सूर्य आवे तब से चित्रानक्षत्र पर सूर्य जाय तब तक खूब जल बरसे।

(आर्द्रा नक्षत्र पर सूर्य प्रायः आषाढ में आता है और चित्रा पर आश्विन में जाता है।)

 २०८–चैत्र कृष्णा (वै० कृ०) में अष्टमी वा त्रयोदशी को जितनी उत्तरा होवे उतनी ही वृष्टि कहनी चाहिये।

 २०९–चैत्र कृष्णा (वै० कृ०) पञ्चमी, नवमी और त्रयोदशी इन दिनों वर्षा के हो जाने से वर्षाऋतु में अनावृष्टि होगी।

 २१०–चैत्र कृष्णा (वै० कृ०) में अष्टमी, चतुर्दशी, को बादलों का होना और उत्तर की हवा का चलना उत्तम है।

 २११–उपर्युक्त दिनों में जिस दिशा में बादल हुए हो उसी दिशा में वृष्टि होगी। अगर उस दिशा में गर्जना होगई वा बिजली चमक गई तो अनावृष्टि समझना चाहिये।

 २१२–चैत्र कृष्णा (वै० कृ०) में दशमी और एकादशी के दिन बादलों के न होने से अच्छी वर्षा होती है। और खूब बादलों के होने से दर्भिक्ष होता है।

 २१३–यदि चैत्रकृष्णा (वै० कृ०) त्रयोदशी को मीन की संक्रान्ति होवे और उस दिन शनिवार भी होवे तो उस वर्ष में बहुत कम धान्य पैदा होता है।

 २१४–फाल्गुन और चैत्र (वैशाख) की अमावास्या जितनी घड़ी हों तो कार्तिक में अन्नों का भाव उतने ही मान वाला होता है। यह निश्चय है।

 २१५–चैत्र (वैशाख) की अमावास्या को रेवती नक्षत्र के होने से सुभिक्ष, अश्विनी के होने से सामान्यभाव, भरणी के होने से रोग कृत्तिका के होने से वर्षा की कमी और रोहिणी के होने से दुःख होता है।

 २१६–वैशाख में गर्जना, बरसना, वायु का चलना बादल होना तथा पंचरंगी आकाश का होना, बिजलियों का चमकना श्रेष्ठ है। इससे शुभ वृष्टि का लक्षण समझना।

 २१७–वैशाख शुक्ला दशमी और प्रतिपदा को यदि वर्षा होजाय तो वर्षाकाल सूखा जाय और यदि वर्षा न होय तो वर्षाऋतु में खूब मेह आवे।

 २१८–कई ज्योतिषियों का मत है कि वैशाख शुक्ला प्रतिपदा और पचमी को बादल न होने से वर्षाऋतु में वृष्टि नहीं होती है।

**अक्षयतृतीया**

 वैशाख में अक्षय तृतीया (वै.शु.तृ) के रोज वर्षा के लिये विशेष परीक्षा की जाती है अतः इसका यह एक प्रकरण अलग लिखा गया है। जिसमें सर्व प्रथम शकुन परीक्षा लिखते हैं।

 २१९-२२०–वैशाख शुक्ल की द्वितीया की रात्रि में जिसमें तृतीया आगई हो, दूसरे के घर जाकर कुछ वस्तु मांगनी चाहिय। इससे उस वर्ष की परीक्षा होती है। यदि गृह-स्वामी उस या-

चक को प्रसन्नता पूर्वक अभिलाषित वस्तु देदे और शुभ तथा मीठे बच्चन बोले तो वह वर्ष उत्तम समझना यदि इससे विपरीत हो तो फल भी उलटा ही समझना। अर्थात् वर्ष भी खराब ही होगा।

 २२१–इसी तरह उसी रात्रि में किसी के घर जाकर स्त्री-पुरुष की बातचीत सुने, वे जैसी बाते करते हों वैसा ही उस वर्ष का फल समझना । अर्थात् यदि वे राजी खुशी का प्रेमालाप करते हों तो वर्ष श्रेष्ठ है और उनमें कलह युक्त वार्तालाप होरहा हो तो वर्ष भी खराब ही रहेगा। (महाभारत के मत से धोबी के घर जाना उचित है)

**इति शकुन परीक्षा**

 २२२-२२३–अक्षय तृतीया के दिन कुम्हार के घर से चार कक्ष सिकोरे लाकर उनमें क्रमसे आषाढ, श्रावण, भाद्र, और आश्विन की भावना करके जल भरदे और देखे कि सब से पहले शीघ्र ही कौन से महीने वाले सिकोरे से और किस दिशा में जल बहता है। जिस महीने के सिकोरे से और जिस दिशा को शीघ्र ही जल बहेगा, उसी महीने में उसी दिशा में खूब वृष्टि होगी और धीरे से अर्थात् सब के बाद जिस करने से जल बहेगा उस मास में वृष्टि नहीं होगी।

**इत्यमत्रपरीक्षा**

 २२४से२२७–अक्षय तृतीया के प्रातः काल में ग्राम के बाहिर किसी पेड़ के नीचे दही, भात (चावल) घृत के पाँच पिण्ड बनाकर चारों दिशा में एक एक रख दे और बीच में भी एक रख दे तथा काकपिण्ड[^7] के विधान से पूजा के मन्त्र वगैरह पढ़कर उसे वहाँ छोड़कर आप स्वयं कहीं छिप कर उसे देखता रहै कि कौवा किस दिशा के पिण्ड को खाता है। जिस दिशा के पिण्ड़ को कौवा आकर के स्वावेगा उस दिशा में सुभिक्ष होगा और यदि बीच के पिण्ड को खावेगा तो सभी देशो में सुभिक्ष होगा। लेकिन जिस दिशा से कौवा आकर के उस पिण्ड को स्वावेगा उस आने वाली दिशा में दुर्भिक्ष पड़ेगा, तथा यदि किसी भी पिएड़ को न खावे तो मारी (मृत्यु) का भय समझना।

[^7]: "काकपिण्डविधिः 'मेरुतन्त्र' में लिखी है।"

**इति काकपरीक्षा**

 २२८-२२९–अक्षय तृतीया को किसी पात्र में जल भर कर उसमें सूर्य के प्रतिबिम्ब को देखे और उससे उस वर्ष का फल बिचारे। यदि उसमें लाल बिम्ब दीखे तो लड़ाई, लीला और पीला दीखे तो रोग, सफेद दीखे तो सुभिक्ष और धूसर (मिटिया) रंग का दीखे तो मूषक (चूहे) वगैरह से दुःख रहे।

**इति निम्बपरीक्षा**

 २३०-२३१–अक्षय तृतीया को संध्याकाल में किसी वृक्ष के नीचे सातों[^8] धान्य अलग अलग मुट्ठी भर के रखने चाहिये। रखते हुए जो धान्य फैल जाय वह धान्य उस वर्ष खूब पैदा होगा और जो इकट्ठा हुआ ही रक्खा रहे वह उस वर्ष में पैदा नहीं होगा।

[^8]: "यव–गोधूमधाम्यानि तिलाः कुङ्कुश्च मुदग्काः। श्यामाकाश्चणाकाश्चैव सप्तधान्यमुदाहृताम्।"

**इति धान्यपरीक्षा**

 २३२-२३३–अक्षय तृतीया को जल से भरे हुए चार घड़ो के नीचे आषाढ आदि चार महीनों की भावना करके अलग अलग मिट्टी के चार पिंड उनके नीचे रखने चाहिये। घड़े के मरे हुए जल से उन पिंडो की मिट्टी जितनी भीगेगी उतनी ही उन पिंड वाले महीनों में वर्षा होगी। और जिस महीने वाला पिंड सूखा रहेगा उस महीने में वर्षा कुछ नहीं होगी।

**इति लोष्टपरीक्षा**

 २३४–अक्षय तृतीया के दिन कृत्तिकानक्षत्र के होने से सामान्य वर्षा होती है और रोहिणी के होने से सुभिक्ष तथा मृगशीर्ष के होने से दुर्भिक्ष होता है।

 २३५–अक्षय तृतीया को यदि रोहिणीनक्षत्र का तारा अस्त नहीं हुआ और चन्द्रमा उससे पहिले ही अस्त होगया तो दुर्भिदा समझना। और यदि रोहिणी पहिले अस्त हो गई और चन्द्रमा इसके बाद अस्त हुआ तो सुभिदा है। इसी बात को लक्ष्य में रखते हुए मारवाड़ में यह कहावत प्रसिद्ध है कि–“**चाँद छोडे हरिणी तो परण्यो छोडे परणी**” अर्थात् हरिणी जोकि रोहिणी से समीपवर्ती तारा है उसे यदि चन्द्रमा छोड़कर उस दिन अस्त होगया तो इतना दुर्भिक्ष पढ़ेगा कि पति अपनी पत्नी तक को भी छोड़ देगा।

 २३६–अक्षय तृतीया को चन्द्रमा सूर्य से बाँई तरफ अस्त होवे तो खराब है। उत्तर की तरफ रहै। वह सुभिक्ष करता है और बराबर लाइन में हो तो दुर्भिक्ष होता है।

 २३७–अक्षय तृतीया को रोहिणीनक्षत्र और गुरुवार के होने से भी धान्य अच्छा पैदा होता है और यदि यह योग न होवे तो विपरीत फल मिले।

**इति नक्षत्रपरीक्षा**

 २३८–वैशाख शुक्ल द्वितीया, तृतीया और प्रतिपदा को बादलों का होना श्रेष्ठ है लेकिन वर्षां होने से शारीरिक पीड़ा होती है।

**इति गर्भपरीक्षा**

 २३९-२४०–वैशाख शुक्ला तृतीया के आखिरी दो प्रहर में दो-दो घड़ी का विभाग करके क्रमसे उनमें आषाढ से चार महीनों की कल्पना करनी चाहिये। उसकी पहिली दो घड़ी में पूर्व की हवा से, दूसरी दो घड़ी में उत्तर की हवा से, तीसरी दो घडी में पश्चिम की हवा से और आखिरी दो घडी में दक्षिण दिशा की हवा से क्रम से आषाढ श्रावण, भाद्र और आश्विन मास की वर्षा अच्छी कहनी चाहिए।

 २४१–अक्षय तृतीया को रात दिन पूर्व दिशा की हवा चलने से धान्य की उपज खूब होती है तथा अश्लेषा पर सूर्य प्रायः श्रावण में आया करता है।

 २४२–अक्षय तृतीया को दक्षिण की वायु से घास की हानि, पश्चिम की वायु से सुख की वृद्धि और उत्तर की वायु से वर्षाऋतु में २१ दिन तक मेघ गर्जता है।

 २४३–अक्षय तृतीया को यदि चौतरफी हवा चले तो दुर्भिक्ष पड़े और राजा तथा प्रजा दुःख पावें।

 २४४–अक्षय तृतीया को पूर्व और उत्तर की हवा से वृष्टि होती है और दक्षिण तथा नैऋत्यकोण की हवा से वृष्टि की रुकावट होती है।

 २४५–कई विद्वानों का मत है कि पश्चिम की हवा से भी खूब वृष्टि होती है। आकाश में बादलों की चाल देखकर वायु की गति पहिचाननी चाहिये।

 २४६–अक्षय तृतीया से पाँच या सात दिन के अन्दर खूब हवा चले तो धान्य कम पैदा होता है और इसके बाद चले तो विशेष पैदा होवे।

**इति वायुपरीक्षा।**

 २४७–अक्षय तृतीया के एक महीने बाद प्रचण्ड हवा के चलने से भाद्रपद में मेघ आकाश में खूब गर्जना करे।

**इत्युग्रवातपरीक्षा।**

**इत्यक्षयतृतीया  
![](../books_images/U-IMG-1728959433Screenshot2024-10-15080023.png)**

 २४८–वैशाख शुक्ला चतुर्थी को सायंकाल के समय उत्तर दिशा की हवा से सुभिक्ष होता है और पंचमी के पूर्व की हवा से महँगाई रहती है।

 २४९–वैशाख शुक्ला पंचमी को यदि गर्जना होय और वर्षा होय तथा दिनभर पूर्व की हवा चले तो भाद्रपद में धान्य महँगा रहे।

 २५०–वैशाख शुक्ला सप्तमी से तीन दिन तक यदि आकाश में बद्दल छाये रहें तो शीघ्र ही वृष्टि होगी।

 २५१–वैशाख शुक्ला एकादशी, द्वादशी और त्रयोदशी को बादल होने से तथा वर्षा होने से दुर्भिक्ष होता है। यदि इन दिनों में बादल न होवे तो वह वर्ष अच्छा समझना।

 २५२–कई कहते हैं कि वैशाख शुक्ल पञ्चमी, सप्तमी, नवमी, एकादशी और त्रयोदशी इन तिथियों में वर्षा का होना उत्तम है।

 २५३–वैशाख शुक्ला दशमी की रात्रि में बादलों के कारण यदि चन्द्रमा नहीं दीखे तो वर्षा ऋतु में वृष्टि अच्छी होगी तथा पृथ्वी पर शान्ति रहेगी।

 २५४–वैशाख शुक्ला दशमी के दिन बादलों का रहना श्रेष्ठ है, किन्तु एकादशी से तीन दिन तक वृष्टि या बादलों के होने से दुर्भिक्ष पड़ता है।

 २५५–चैत्र और वैशाख के दोनों पक्षों की चतुर्दशी और अष्टमी को दक्षिण की हवा से मेघ खूब बरसता है।

 २५६–चैत्र और वैशाख के दोनों पक्षों की अष्टमी और चतुर्दशी को बिजली, दृष्टि और गर्जना के होने से वर्षाऋतु में वर्षा का आनन्द विशेष प्राप्त होता है।

 २५७–वैशाख की पूर्णिमा में चन्द्रमा का ग्रहण होवे तो धान्य की कमी से पांचाल (पंजाब) देश और शूरसेन (संयुक्त प्रान्त) देश पीड़ा को प्राप्त होता है।

 २५८–वैशाख की पूर्णिमा की वृष्टि से भाद्रपद में धान्य महँगा होता है। इस पूर्णिमा से वायु की परीक्षा करनी चाहिये।

 २५९–वैशाख की पूर्णिमा से ज्येष्ठ के कृष्णपक्ष की अष्टमी तक गर्भ के लक्षण दिखाई दें तो सूर्य जब आर्द्रा नक्षत्र पर आवे तब से चित्रा पर जाये तब तक खूब वृष्टि होती है। अर्थात् पूर्णिमा से अष्टमी तक के ९ दिन आर्द्रा से चित्रा तक के फल देने वाले समझने चाहिये।

 २६०-२६१–वैशाख की पूर्णिमा को घडियों को १४ भागों में विभक्त करके उनमें आर्द्रानक्षत्र के १४ दिनों की कल्पना करलेनी चाहिये। यदि प्रातःकाल की चार घडी के अन्दर पूर्व की हवा चले तो आर्द्रा नक्षत्र पर सूर्य जब आवे उसके पहिले दिन में वृष्टि होती है। इस तरह पूर्व की वायु से चार-चार घडी के क्रम से सब दिनों की वृष्टि का फल समझ लेना चाहिये।

 २६२–इसी तरह वैशाख कृष्णा प्रतिपदा (वर्तमान हिसाब से ज्येष्ठ कृष्णा प्रतिपदा) की घड़ियों को १४ भागों में विभक्त करके उनमें पुनर्वसु नक्षत्र के १४ दिनों की कल्पना करके पूर्व की वायु से वर्षा का पूर्ववत् फल समझना चाहिये।

 २६३–वैशाख कृष्णा (ज्येष्ठ कृष्णा) दशमी को रेवतीनक्षत्र होने से सुभिक्ष, एकादशी के दिन होने से खण्डवृष्टि और द्वादशी के दिन होने से दुर्भिक्ष होता है।

 २६४–वैशाख कृष्णा (ज्येष्ठ कृष्णा) एकादशी या द्वादशी को बादल, बिजली, गर्जना और वर्षा के होने से वह संवत्सर श्रेष्ठ होता है।

 २६५–वैशाख की अमावास्या को दिन में वा रात में यदि खूब जल बरसे तो वर्षा ऋतु में अनावृष्टि होती है। यही फल कई विद्वान् ज्येष्ठ की अमावास्या का मानते हैं।

इति मासान्तरोहिणी।

 २६६–ज्येष्ठ शुक्ल में गर्जना होने से गर्भ नष्ट होजाता है। और कडकने से वज्र की सी आवाज होने से श्रावण और भाद्रपद में अनावृष्टि होती है।

 २६७–ज्येष्ठ शुक्ला प्रतिपदा को रविवार के होने से हवा विशेष चले, भौमवार से रोग और बुधवार से दुर्भिक्ष होता है इस दिन गुरु, शुक्र और सोमवार का होना श्रेष्ठ है।

 २६८–इस तिथि को यदि शनिवार होवे तो जल का नाश और प्रजा का क्षय होय। इस तरह ज्येष्ठ की प्रतिपदा को वारों का विशेष फल देखना चाहिये।

 २६९–ज्येष्ठ शुक्ला द्वितीया को यदि चन्द्रमा सूर्य से बराबर की लाइन में रहै तो सामान्य फल होवे और बायाँ रहे तो सुमित तथा दक्षिण की तरफ रहे तो दुर्भिक्ष पड़े। यदि इस दिन रोहीणीनक्षत्र का योग हो तो महँगाई रहे।

 २७०–ज्येष्ठ शुक्ला द्वितीया को यदि बादल गर्जना कर दे तो पहिले संपन्न हुआ सब गर्भ नष्ट होजाता है। इस तरह ज्योतिषी कहते हैं।

**मासादिरोहिणी।**

 १७१–ज्येष्ठ शुक्ला में रोहिणी के योग की अच्छी तरह परीक्षा करनी चाहिये। यदि रोहिणीनक्षत्र के दिन बादल न हों तो वर्षाऋतु में अनावृष्टि होगी तथा बादल हो जाय तो वर्षा और सुभिक्षता रहेंगी।

 २७२–किसी का मत है कि बादल होने से मध्यम वृष्टि होती है, वृष्टि होजाने से खराब वृष्टि होती है, रोहिणी के दिन जल गिरने से ईति[^10] का भय नष्ट हो जाता है।

[^10]: "अतिवृष्टि, अनावृष्टि, मूषिक, टिड्डी तोते और समीपवर्ती राजा ईति कहलाते हैं।"

 २७३-२७४–रोहिणी के पहिले अंश में वृष्टि होने से सुभिक्ष, दूसरे अंश में सर्प और कीटकों का डर, तीसरे अंश में मध्यम वृष्टि और चौथे अंश में अल्प वर्षा होती है। तथा पाँचवें में सर्व धान्यों की उपज, छठे में उड़द की विशेष उपज, सातवें में तुषधान्य, चावल वगैरह की पैदाइश और आठवें अंश में वृष्टि होने से कहीं कहीं वर्षा होती है। ऐसा भी किसी का मत है।

 २७५–रोहिणी नक्षत्र पर सूर्य रहते हुए रोहिणी से चन्द्रमा का कुछ भी योग हो गया तो उस देश में दुर्दशा का करने वाला दुर्भिक्ष पड़ता है।

 २७६–रोहिणी नक्षत्र पर जब सूर्य १३ दिन तक रहता है उन दिनों में द्वितीया के दिन यदि चन्द्रमा का कभी दैवयोग से रोहिणी नक्षत्र के साथ योग हो जाय तो वहाँ महाभय प्राप्त होता है।

 २७७–रोहिणी के सूर्य में यदि चन्द्रमा का रोहिणी से एक घड़ी भी योग न होने पावे तो बहुत श्रेष्ठ है।

**इति मासादि रोहिणी।**

 २७८–ज्येष्ठ शुक्ल तृतीया को आर्द्रानक्षत्र हो और उस दिन यदि वर्षा होजाय तो वर्षा ऋतु का नाश हो जाता है और दुर्भिक्ष पडता है।

 २७९–ज्येष्ठ शुक्ल पंचमी को पूर्व, पश्चिम और उत्तर की हवा सुभिक्ष की करने वाली है किन्तु उत्तर की हवा से शलभादि कीट अवश्य होते हैं।

 २८०–ज्येष्ठ शुक्ल पञ्चमी को वायव्य, नैऋत्य, अग्नि और ईशान कोण की हवा से अनावृष्टि होती है और चौतरफी हवा से सर्वनाश हो जाता है।

 २८१–ज्येष्ठ शुक्ला पंचमी को यदि दक्षिण का पवन चले और बादलों से घिरे हुए आकाश में गर्जना होवे तो आश्विन में अन्न महँगा रहे।

 २८२–ज्येष्ठ शुक्ला सप्तमी को दक्षिण के पवन चलने से और बादल तथा गर्जना होने से कार्तिक में अन्न महँगा रहता है।

**पवनधारणा।**

 २८३–ज्येष्ठ शुक्ल में अष्टमी से चारतिथियाँ वायुधारणा कहलाती हैं। इनमें मृदु, स्निग्ध और स्थगिता (बद्दलों को रोकने वाले) वायु का होना श्रेष्ठ है।

 २८४–इन दिनों में बिजलियाँ, जल की बूंदें और धूलिका के सहित हवा का चलना, सूर्य चन्द्रमा पर गदल का छाजाना ये सब शुभ धारणा के लक्षण हैं।

 २८५-२८६–इन दिनों में सूर्य चन्द्रमा के सुन्दर और साफ कुण्डलना का होना, इकट्ठे हुए स्निग्ध बादलों का होना तथा उन बादलों की दक्षिण गति होना शुभधारणा के लक्षण हैं। इन चारों तिथियों में एक तरह के लक्षण दिखाई देने से श्रावणादि महीनों में अच्छी वृष्टि होती हैं। यदि इन दिनों में कुछ वर्षा होजाय अथवा कुछ अन्तर से ये सब लक्षण दीखें तो अशुभ है।

 २८७–ज्येष्ठ शुक्ल में आर्द्रा आदि नव नक्षत्रों में जल की परीक्षा करे यदि इन दिनों में बादल नहीं होवें तो जल अच्छा बरसे और यदि इन नक्षत्रों में बादल होजाय तो अवृष्टि कहना चाहिये।

 २८८–ज्येष्ठ शुक्ल में स्वाति, विशाखा, अनुराधा और ज्येष्ठा इन नक्षत्रों में वृष्टि होजाय तो इस धारणा नाश से श्रावणादि चार मास में अवृष्टि समझनी चाहिये।

**इति धारणा।**

 २८९–ज्येष्ठ में चित्रा, स्वाति और विशाखा नक्षत्र के दिनों में मेघ और बिजलियों के होने से आषाढ श्रावण और भाद्रपद में अच्छी वर्षा होती हैं और सुभिक्ष होता है।

 २९०–ज्येष्ठ शुक्ल में चित्रा, स्वाति और विशाखा में बादल न होने से आषाढ में वृष्टि का अभाव रहता है और श्रावण में वर्षा होती है।

 २९१–किसी का मत है कि ज्येष्ठ शुक्ल में चित्रा, स्वाति और विशाखा नक्षत्रों के दिनों में वृष्टि होजाय तो श्रावण में वृष्टि नहीं होय और धान्य महँगा रहे।

 २९२–वैशाख और ज्येष्ठ के दोनों पक्ष की चतुर्दशी और अष्टमी तथा ज्येष्ठ शुक्ल की दशमी को शनिवार के होने से अनावृष्टि होती है।

 २९३-२९४–ज्येष्ठ शुक्ल एकादशी की घड़ियों के सात का भाग देने से यदि दो या चार शेष रहें तो खूब वृष्टि, पाँच रहैं तो वायु की अधिकता, छः शेष रहैं तो वर्षा की कमी और एक या शून्य शेष रहे तो सर्वत्र वर्षा होती है ।

 २९५–ज्येष्ठ शुक्ला एकादशी से चार दिन तक यदि उत्तर की हवा चलती रहे तो वर्षाऋतु के चारों महीनों में अच्छी वृष्टि होय।

 २९६–उपरिलिखित क्रम से यदि उन दिनों में विपरीत हवा चले या बादल विपरीत जाय तो उस महीने के उस नक्षत्र में वृष्टि नहीं होय।

 २९७–उपरिलिखित चारों दिनों में प्रारंभ के समय यदि पश्चिम की दवा चले तो अनावृष्टि और दुर्भिक्ष का भय होता है।

 २९८-२९९–उपरिलिखित चारों दिनों में चारों दिशाओं की हवा उत्तरोत्तर यदि एक को एक दबावे तो वर्षाऋतु के चारों महीनों में अच्छी वर्षा होती है। और यदि चारों दिशाओं की हवा विपरीत क्रम से चलकर एक दिशा की हवा अन्य दिशा की हवा को दबाये तो वर्षाऋतु में वृष्टि न होकर शीतकाल में वृष्टि होती है।

 ३००–यदि इन दिनों में वायव्य, पश्चिम और नैऋत्य में वायु चले तो श्रावण तथा कार्त्तिकमें वृष्टि न होकर भाद्रपद और आश्विन में उत्तम वृष्टि होय।

 ३०१–पूर्व, ईशान और अग्निकोण में यदि वायु चले तो भाद्र और आश्विन में वृष्टि न होकर श्रावण, कार्तिक में अच्छी वर्षा होय।

 ३०२–ज्येष्ठ शुक्ला चतुर्दशी और पूर्णिमा के दिन वृष्टि होने से गर्भ का नाश होजाता है। इससे वर्षाऋतु में वृष्टि नहीं होती।

 ३०३–ज्येष्ठ की पूर्णिमा में यदि चन्द्र-ग्रहण होवे तो कौशल (अयोध्या प्रान्त) और कलिंग (उड़ीसा) देशवाले अन्न के न मिलने से पीडित हों।

 ३०४–ज्येष्ठ की पूर्णिमा के अन्त में यदि मूलनक्षत्र के होते हुए वर्षा हो जाय तो ६० दिन तक वृष्टि नहीं होती और इसके बाद जल बरसता हैI

 ३०५–इस तिथि को मूल नक्षत्र के पाद (चरण) विभाग से भी वृष्टि की कल्पना करनी चाहिये। यदि पूर्व पाद में वृष्टि होजाय तो चातुर्मास्य के अन्त में वर्षा समझनी चाहिये।

 ३०६–वृष राशि पर सूर्य आने पर यदि ज्येष्ठ शुक्ला पंचमी को वृष्टि होजावे तो पूर्वाषाढ के दिन की वर्षा का और मूलनक्षत्र के दिन जल बरसने का दोष नहीं समझना।

 ३०७–इसी तरह ज्येष्ठमास में श्रवण और घनिष्ठा के दिन यदि गर्जना, वृष्टि तथा बिजलियाँ होजायँ तो ज्येष्ठा और मूल के दिन बरसने का दोष नहीं समझना चाहिये।

 ३०८–मूल नक्षत्र का पूर्णिमा के दिन होना श्रेष्ठ है, प्रतिपदा के दिन होना सामान्य है और द्वितीया को होना भी खराब है। अनुराधा नक्षत्र के दिन पूर्णिमा का होना खराब है।

 ३०९–ज्येष्ठ कृष्णा (प्रचलित हिसाब से आषाढ कृष्णा) प्रतिपदा के दिन बिजली, गर्जना और वर्षा से घास का दुर्भिक्ष पड़ता है तथा वृष्टि भी कहीं कहीं होती है।

 ३१०–ज्येष्ठ की पूर्णिमा के समाप्त होने के बाद पूर्वाषाढ नक्षत्र में यदि गर्जना होजाय तथा बिजलियाँ और बादल घेर घुमेर छाये रहैं तो वर्षाऋतु में अच्छी वृष्टि होती है।

**प्रवर्षणमितिः**

 ३११–ज्येष्ठ शुक्ला पूर्णिमा के दिन मूलनक्षत्र आवें, उसके धागे से पूर्वाषाढ, उत्तराषाढ इत्यादि नक्षत्रों के क्रम से सत्ताईस नक्षत्रों तक वर्षा की परीक्षा करनी चाहिये।

 प्रायः ज्येष्ठ की पूर्णिमा के दिन मूल या ज्येष्ठा नक्षत्र आया करता है।

 ३१२–ज्येष्ठ की पूर्णिमा के समाप्त होने पर पूर्वाषाढ आदि सत्ताईस नक्षत्रों में बरसे हुए जल को ताप करके ऋतुओं के क्रमसे वर्षा जानलेनी चाहिये। जल नापने की विधि आगे बताई जारही है।

 ३१३-३१४–एक हाथ चौड़ा, एक हाथ गहरा और एक हाथ लम्बा जमीन में कुड[^11] का भी बनालिया करते हैं।") (खड्डा) खोदना चाहिये। और इसमें आगे बताए हुए नाप के चिन्हों को लगाकर इसमें गिरे हुए वर्षा के जल को आढक से नापे। पचास तोलों का एक आढक और चार आढक का एक द्रोण होता है। ये द्रोण ही वृष्टि के अन्तिम मान माने गये हैं। अब आगे स्वाभाविक रीति से अर्थात् किसी ग्रह की रुकावट के न होने पर नक्षत्रों में जितने द्रोण जल बरसता है वह कहा जाता है।

[^11]: "कई इस यन्त्र को काठ (लकडी

 ३१५–द्रोण की चौथाई (एक आढक) का प्रस्थ नाम है। और द्रोण को जल के नाप में 'अक्षर' इस नाम से भी कहा करते हैं।

 ३१६ से ३१९–धनिष्ठा, रेवती, चित्रा, हस्त, पूर्वाषाढ और मृगशिर नक्षत्र में १६ द्रोण, स्वाति, ज्येष्ठा और शतभिषा में चार द्रोण; मघा, अनुराधा, भरणी श्रवण और मूल में चौदह द्रोण; उत्तराषाढ, पुनर्वसु और विशाखा में बोस द्रोणः, कृत्तिका में दश द्रोण; उत्तराभाद्रपद, रोहिणी, पूर्वफल्गुनी और उत्तराफाल्गुनी में पच्चीस; अश्लेषा में तेरह; पुष्य और पूर्वफल्गुनी में पन्द्रह; आर्द्रा में अठारह द्रोण और अश्विनी में बारह द्रोण जल होता है। यदि कोई उपद्रवी ग्रह न हो तो इस ऊपर लिखे हुए नाप से नक्षत्रों में बरसा करता है।

 कितना रसा हुआ जल नापना चाहिये, वह बतलाते हैं।

 ३२०–जिस वर्षा से पृथ्वी पर जल बहने लगजाय और जिससे घास के अप्रभाग से बूंदे टपकने लगजाय, यहाँ तक का वर्षा का जल नापना चाहिये इससे कम वर्षा हुआ जल नापने के योग्य नहीं।

 ३२१–दश योजन (४० कोस) के वृत्त (सर्किल) में हुआ वर्षा न अल्प और न अतिवृष्टि है बारह योजन (४८ कास) से आगे बरसने को वर्षा कहते हैं।

 ३२२–जिन नक्षत्रों में जैसी वर्षा हुई हो वैसो ही वर्षा फिर उन्हीं नक्षत्रों पर सूर्य के आने से वर्षा होती हैं। यदि पूर्वाषाढ और उत्तराषाढ में वर्षा न होवे तो अनावृष्टि समझनी चाहिये।

 कितनी दूरी पर वर्षा या बादल है, वह लिखते हैं।

 ३२३-३२४–साधारण रीति से गर्जना एक[^12] विपक्ष में तीन सौ चार हाथ दूरी पर जाती है।

[^12]: "एक घड़ी की ६० पक्ष और एक पल की ६० विपत हुआ करती है ।"

बिजली चमकने पर जितने विपल बाद गर्जना सुनाई देवें ऊपर लिखे हुए एक त्रिपल के हिसाब से उतने हीं हाथ की दूरी पर वर्षा समझनी चाहिए।

**इति प्रवर्षणामितिः**

 ३२५–ज्येष्ठ में श्रवण, धनिष्ठा नक्षत्र के दिन वायु, वृष्टि, बिजली और गर्जना से वर्षाऋतु में अच्छी वर्षा होती है। और यदि इस दिन गरमी विशेष पड़े तो वृष्टि की रुकावट जाननी चाहिये।

 ३२६–ज्येष्ठकृष्णा २ (अर्थात् प्रचलित व्यवहार से अषाढ कृष्णा द्विसोया) को मंगलवार के होने से अनावृष्टि, रविवार से गरमी, बुध से बादलों की केवल छाया, शनिवार के होने से प्रजा का नाश होता है।

 ३२७–ज्येष्ठकृष्णा (आ० कृ०) चतुर्थी को यदि सूर्य बादलों से केवल ढका हुआ रहे तो तीन महीनों के बाद खूब जल बरसे।

 ३२८–ज्येष्ठकृष्णा (आ० कृ०) चतुर्थी को सूर्य के अस्त होने के बाद जब जल नहीं बरसता है तब वर्षाऋतु में दुःख के साथ वर्षा होती है। अर्थात् बहुत कम वृष्टि होती है। यह भी किसी का मत है।

 ३२९–ज्येष्ठ कृष्णा (आ० कृ०) पंचमी को यदि पश्चिमदिशा का पवन चले और वृष्टि, गर्जना तथा इन्द्रधनुष होवे तो कार्त्तिक में अन्न की महंगाई रहै।

 ३३०–ज्येष्ठ कृष्णा (आ० कृ०) में चतुर्थी, पञ्चमी, षष्ठी, सप्तमी और श्रमावास्या को मेघ के लक्षण विशेषकर देखने चाहिए।

 ३३१-३३२–यदि ऊपर लिखे हुए तिथियों में सूर्यास्त के समय पूर्वदिशा का आक्राश, पर्वत, हाथी वगैरह कई रूप वाले बादलों से ढका हुआ होतो पांच या सात रात्रि के अन्दर अन्दर शीघ्र ही वर्षा होने वाली समझनी चाहिये। यही फल सन्ध्या के समय अन्य दिशाओं का भी समझना चाहिये।

 ३३३–दक्षिण दिशा के कोटीनार सहित पैदा हुए मेघ तीन, पाँच या सात रात के अन्दर अन्दर कुछ वृष्टि करते हैं।

 ३३४–पश्चिम दिशा में सन्ध्याकाल के समय सूर्य के अस्त होजाने पर यदि पर्वतों की तरह काले बद्दल दिखाई दें तो शीघ्र ही वर्षा आवेगी, यह समझना चाहिये।

 ३३५–सन्ध्या के समय उत्तर दिशा में पर्वतों की श्रेणी (लाइन) की तरह यदि काले बादल दिखाई दें तो उसके तीसरे दिन मन को तुष्ट करने वाली दृष्टि होती है।

 ३३६-३३७–अग्निकोण के बादल जल कम बरसाने वाले और ताप विशेष देने वाले होते हैं, नैऋत्यकोण के बादलों से ६ प्रकार की ईतियों का भय, रोग और वर्षा भी होती है, वायव्यकोण के उन्नत बादलों से हवा और वृष्टि होती है, तथा ईशानकोण के बादल अच्छी बरसा और सुख देनेवाले होते हैं। ये सब लक्षण प्रधानतया पहिले कही हुई ज्येष्ठमास के कृष्णपक्ष (आ० कृ०) की चतुर्थी, पंचमी, षष्टी, सप्तमी और अमावास्या के ही समझने चाहिये।

 ३३८–ज्येष्ठ मास के कृष्णपक्ष की (अर्थात् आषाढ कृष्णा की) अष्टमी औरचर्तुदशी को दक्षिणदिशा की हवा चलने से चौतरफ वृष्टि होती है।

 ३३९–ज्येष्ठ कृष्णा (आ० कृ०) में अष्टमी का चन्द्रमा यदि काले बादलों के होजाने से नहीं दीखे तो पृथ्वी पर जल खूब बरसे। और यदि उस रात में चन्द्रमा साफ दिखाईदे तो वृष्टि का अभाव समझना चाहिये।

 ३४०–ज्येष्ठ कृष्णा (आ० कृ०) दशमी को जल बरसने से भाद्रपद में वर्षा होती है और यदि उक्त तिथि के दिन रेवती नक्षत्र भी हो तो विशेष श्रेष्ठ है।

 ३४१–ज्येष्ठ कृष्णा (आ० कृ०) दशमी को शनिवार के होने से प्रजा अनावृष्टि और दुर्भिक्ष से दुःखी रहे।

 ३४२–ज्येष्ठ कृष्णा (आ० कृ०) दशमी को रेवती नक्षत्र के होने से सुभिक्ष, एकादशी को होने से महामारी और द्वादशी को होने से दुर्भिक्ष पड़ता है।

 ३४३–ज्येष्ठ कृष्णा (आषाढ कृष्णा) अमावास्या को आर्द्रा के प्रतिपदा को पुनर्वसु के और द्वितीया को पुष्य के होने से क्रम से जल, धान्य और घास नहीं होता है।

 ३४४-३४५–ज्येष्ठ की अमावास्या और पूर्णिमा में रात दिन बादल रहें तथा अमावास्या से आषाढ और श्रावण और पूर्णिमा से भाद्रपद और आश्विन को दिन और रात का विभाग माने यदि इनमें पश्चिम की हवा चले तो अनावृष्टि होती है। कहीं कहीं भाग्य से वृष्टि होजाती है।

**मासांत रोहिणी।**

 ३४६–रोहिणी नक्षत्र पर से सूर्य के चले जाने के बाद अर्थात् जिसदिन रोहिणी नक्षत्र पर सूर्य भावे उससे तेरह दिन के अनम्बर जब रोहिली नक्षत्र पर चन्द्रमा भावे, उस दिन के चार विभाग करके उसमें क्रम से श्रावणादि चार मासों की कल्पना कर वायु की परीक्षा करे जिस विभाग के माल में अभी बचते उसमें अच्छी वर्षा समझनी चाहिये ।

 ३४७–उपयुक्त दिन पूर्व की वायु से वर्षा, अभिकोण की से गर्मी वा अग्निभय, दक्षिण की हवा से धान्यनाश नैऋत्य की से दुर्भिक्ष, पश्चिम की से सुदृष्टि, वायव्यकोण की हवा से वृष्टि सहित वायु, उत्तर की से सुदृष्टि और ईशानकोणकी वायु से स्वास्थ्य होता है।

 ३४८-३४९-३५०–उपर्युक्त दिन मध्याह काल से पहिले वायु चलने से भावण और भाद्रपद मैं वृष्टि होती है और मध्याह्न में चलने से भाद्रपद और अश्विन में तथा मध्याह्न के बाद वायु चलने से अश्विन, कार्त्तिक में। यदि दिन भर ही अच्छी वायु चलती रहे तो सब महींनो में अच्छी वर्षा समझनी चाहिये और पदि अशुभ वायु चले तो सर्वथा विपरीत फल मिलता है। यदि शुभ, अशुभ दोनों ही चले तो इनमें जो बलवान् हो उसी का शुभाशुभ फल समझना चाहिये।

 ३५१–ज्येष्ठ कृष्णा (आषाढ कृष्णा) एकादशी को रोहिणी नक्षत्र के होने से सुभिक्ष होता है यदि वह मन न हो तो दुर्भिच करना चाहिये।

 ३५२–ज्येष्ठ (आषाढ) कृष्णा एकादशी को जितने विशेष समय तक अर्थात् जितनी घड़ी रोहिणी रहे उतनी ही धान्य की पैदावार उत्तम होती है इसकी परीक्षा करलेनी चाहिये। तीन घड़ी तक रहने से एक विश्वा, सब पड़ी से तीन विस्वा इत्यादि क्रम समझना चाहिये।

 ३५३–ज्येष्ठ कृष्णा (आषाढ कृष्णा) दशमी को रोहिणी होने से अल्पवृष्टि दुर्भिक्ष और प्रजा को दुःख होता है।

 ३५४–ज्येष्ठ (आषाढ) कृष्ण एकादशी को कृतिका नक्षत्र होने से खंडयकाल अर्थात् कहीं सुभिक्षऔर कहीं दुर्भिक्षहोता है। और रोहिणी नक्षत्र होने से सुभिक्ष तथा मृगशीर्ष के होने से बड़ा दुर्भिक्ष होता है।

 ३५५–ज्येष्ठ तथा आषाढ में रोहिणीनक्षत्र के दिन वर्षा होने से उस वर्ष अच्छी वृष्टि होतीहै यदि वृष्टि न होतो उस वर्ष वृष्टि का प्रभाव समझना चाहिये।

 ३५६–आषाढ कृष्ण (अर्थात् श्रावण कृष्ण) में रोहिणी नक्षत्र के दिन का जो फल कहा जायगा वह सब इस मास में समझना चाहिये।

 ३५७–आषाढ शुक्ल के प्रथम मंगलवार के दिन यदि आकाश बादल रहित हो एवं बिजली और गर्जना भी नहो तो दोमासतक अवृष्टि होती है।

 ३५८–आषाढ शुक्ला प्रतिपदा को प्रातःकाल जितनी घड़ी पुनर्वसु नक्षत्र हो उतनी ही वृष्टि समझनी चाहिये। अर्थात् जितनी घड़ी हों उन की तिहाई बिस्वा वृष्टि होती है, क्योंकि ६० घड़ी नक्षत्र और २० विस्वा वर्षा समान है।

 ३५९–आषाढ शुक्ला प्रतिपदा, द्वितीया और तृतीया को दृष्टि होने से उस वर्ष क्रम से एक, बारह और सोलह द्रोण वर्षा होती है।

 ३६०–आषाढ शुक्ला प्रतिपदा, द्वादशी और पूर्णिमा को तेज हवा चलने से उस वर्ष मेघ का अभाव समझना चाहिये।

 ३६१–आषाढ शुक्ला प्रतिपदा या पञ्चमी तिथि को बृहस्पति, शुक्र अथवा सोमवार के आने से सुवृष्टि और सुभिक्ष होता है।

 ३६२–इस प्रकार आषाढ शुक्ला द्वितीया या नवमी तिथि को भी गुरु, शुक्र अथवा सोमवार के आने से सुवृष्टि और सुभिक्ष होता है वस्तुएँ सस्ती मिलती हैं।

 ३६३–कई आचार्यों का मत है कि आषाढ शुक्ला प्रतिपदा को रविवार के होने से गरमी, बुध से छायामात्र, मंगल से अनावृष्टि और शनिवार के होने से प्रजा को दुःख होता है।

 ३६४–आषाढ शुक्ला द्वितीया और पंचमी को यदि बादल हों या वृष्टि हो तो श्रावण में अधिक वर्षा होती है।

 ३६५–आषाढ शुक्ला तृतीया को पूर्व की हवा चले और पूर्व से ही बादल भी आते हों तो भाद्रपद में अधिक वर्षा होती है।

 ३६६–आषाढ शुक्ला चतुर्थी को दक्षिण की हवा चलने और पूर्व की तरफ बादल जाते हों तो आश्विन में अच्छी वर्षा होती है।

 ३६७–आषाढ शुक्ला चतुर्थी को गर्जना, बिजली और वर्षा के होने से उस वर्ष अनावृष्टि होती है।

 ३६८–आषाढ शुक्ला पंचमी को जिस देश में हवा के साथ जल बरसे वहाँ अतिवृष्टि से दुर्भिक्ष होता है।

 ३६९–आषाढ शुक्ला पंचमी को उत्तर की हवा चले और बड़े ऊँचे ऊँचे बादल दिखाई दें तो कार्तिक में वृष्टि होती है।

 ३७०–आषाढ शुक्ला पञ्चमी को यदि इन्द्रधनुष, गर्जना और वर्षा के सहित पश्चिम की हवा चले तो कार्तिक में महँगाई होवे।

 ३७१–आषाढ शुक्ला पंचमी को यदि बिजलियाँ अधिक चमकें तो सुवृष्टि होकर सर्वत्र सुभिक्ष होता है।

 ३७२–आषाढ शुक्ला पंचमी के दिन बूंद गिरने से निस्संदेह मास के पहिले ही वृष्टि होने लगती है, यदि बूंद न पडे तो कृष्णपक्ष में थोड़ी वर्षा होती है।

 ३७३से ३७५–आषाढ शुक्ला में द्वितीया को प्रथमवार वृष्टि होय, तृतीया को पूर्व की हवा चले और बड़े बड़े बादल दिखाई दें, चतुर्थी को दक्षिण की हवा और पूर्व से बादल जाते हों तथा पंचमी को उत्तर की हवा और ऊँचे ऊँचे बादल होवें तो उस वर्ष श्रावण से चार मास तक अच्छी वर्षा होती है।

 ३७६-३७७–आषाढ शुक्ला द्वितीया, तृतीया, चतुर्थी और पंचमी को आकाश बादलों से घिरा हुआ रहे पूर्वोत्तर की अर्थात् ईशान कोण की वायु चले तो वृष्टि समझनी चाहिये। अर्थात्या तो अतिवृष्टि वा सुवृष्टि होती है जिससे सुभिक्ष वा भाव स्थिर रहता है यदि उक्त दिन वर्षा और बादल न हों और नैऋत्य कोण की हवा चले तो दुर्भिक्ष समझना चाहिये।

 ३७८–आषाढ शुक्ला तृतीया और पंचमी को दक्षिण तथा पश्चिम की हवा चलने से धान्य नष्ट होता है और दुर्भिक्ष पड़ता है।

 ३७९–आषाढ शुक्ला तृतीया और पंचमी को पूर्व-उत्तर की हवा से धान्य की पैदायश और वृष्टि उत्तम होती है।

 ३८० से ३८३–आषाढ शुक्ला चतुर्थी और पंचमी को पूर्व की बिजली और हवा के होने से सुभिक्ष होता है, अग्नि को की बिजली और हवा से अनावृष्टि, दक्षिण की से व्याधि और मृत्यु, नैऋत्य कोण की से सात प्रकार की ईतियों[^13] का कष्ट, पश्चिम की से धान्य, वायव्य कोण की से साधारण धान्य, उत्तर की से अधिक सम्पत्ति और ईशान कोण की बिजली और हवा से अच्छी सुख सम्पत्ति तथा वृष्टि होती है। चौतरफ की वायु से कहीं कहीं वर्षा होती है। तथा बिजली जिधर चमकती हो यदि उसके विरुद्ध दिशा की हवा चले तो इतियों का प्रायः दुःख रहता है।

[^13]: "अतिवृष्टिरनावृष्टिर्मूषकाः शलभाः शुकाः। स्वचक्रं परचक्रं च सप्तैता ईतयः स्मृताः।"

 ३८४–यदि शुभ हवा के बहते हुए भूकंप होजावे तो धान्य तो अवश्य पैदा होता है किन्तु उपद्रव अधिक होते हैं।

 ३८५–यदि वायु प्रथम तो अशुभ अर्थात् आग्नेय, दक्षिण और नैऋत्य का चले और पीछे शुभ अर्थात् पूर्व, ईशान और उत्तर का चलने लगजाय तो सुवृष्टि ही होती है किन्तु धान्य सम्पत्ति नहीं होती।

 ३८६–आषाढ शुक्ला चतुर्थी, पंचमी, षष्ठी और सप्तमी की सन्ध्या के समय पीले बादल होने से काले बादल होकर वर्षा होती है।

 ३८७–आषाढ शुक्ला षष्टी को वर्षा होने से श्रावण में वर्षा होती है अन्यथा उक्त मास में अवृष्टि समझनी चाहिये।

 ३८८–आषाढ शुक्ला सप्तमी को वृष्टि होने से भाद्रपद में अच्छी वर्षा होती है और अवृष्टि होने से उस मास में भी अनावृष्टि ही रहती है।

  ३८९–आषाढ शुक्ला अष्टमी को बिजली, गर्जना और वर्षा होने से आश्विन में अच्छी वर्षा होती है। वृष्टि होने से उक्त मास में भी वृष्टि का अभाव ही रहता है।

 ३९०–आषाढ शुक्ला अष्टमी को पूर्व और दक्षिण की हवा से दुर्भिक्ष और पश्चिम तथा उत्तर की वायु से सुभिक्ष होता है।

 ३९१–आषाढ शुक्ला पञ्चमी से चार दिन तक जितने बादल हों उतनी ही अधिक वर्षा उस वर्षाकाल में समझनी चाहिए।

**स्वाति योगः।**

 ३९२–बारहों महीनों में स्वाति के योगों का परीक्षण होता है। आषाढ में विशेषरूप से फलों के पाक की परीक्षा होती है।

 ३९३–आषाढ शुक्ला नवमी तिथि को शनिवार और अनुराधा नक्षत्र होने से कहीं तो कुछ धान्य पैदा अथवा महँगा हो जाता है; और कहीं पर दुर्भिक्ष ही रहता है।

 ३९४–आषाढ शुक्ल नवमी को बिजलियाँ हों और बादलों का घटाटोप हो तथा कुछ जल भी वरस जावे तो उस वर्ष अतिवृष्टि होती है।

 ३९५–आषाढ शुक्ला नवमी के रोज बिजलियाँ और घटाटोप का होना श्रेष्ठ है। यदि उक्त दिन बिजलियाँ तथा बादल भी न हों तो अवृष्टि से दुर्भिक्ष समझ लेना चाहिये।

 ३९६–आषाढ शुक्ला नवमी को अत्यन्त (मूसलाधार) वर्षा होने से उस वर्ष अत्यन्त वृष्टि और अत्यल्प ही धान्य पैदा होगा।

 ३९७–वृष्टि दुर्बल हो अर्थात् वेग से हुई हो, किन्तु अधिक मात्रा में हो चुकी हो तो धान्य बहुत पैदा होता है। यदि किसी कारण केवल बूँदमात्र अथवा अतिवृष्टि होजावे तो धान्यनाश समना चाहिये।

 ३९८–आषाढ शुक्ल नवमी को सूर्यास्त के समय निर्मल (बिना बादल) आकाश रहने से दुर्भिक्ष होता है। वृष्टि विशेष में उत्पन्न होने वाला यह फल अनप[^14] देश में समझना चाहिये।

[^14]: "देश तीन प्रकार के होते हैं अनूप, जांगल और मरु । २५ हाथ तक जहाँ जल निकल आवे वह अनूप कहलाता है।"

 ३९९–आषाढ शुक्ला नवमी दशमी को अधिक गर्जना होने से अतिवृष्टि होती है। कई ऋषियों का मत है कि अधिक गर्जना से दुर्भिक्ष होजाता है।

 वास्तव में दोनों ही मत ठीक हैं, क्योंकि प्रथम मत वालों के विज्ञान से अधिक वर्षा होने के कारण दुर्भिक्ष होना ही सिद्ध होता है।

 ४००–आषाढ शुक्ला नवमी, दशमी की रात्रि में यदि चन्द्रमा बादलों से आच्छादित हो तो शीतकाल में अच्छी वर्षा होती है।

 ४०१–आषाढ शुक्ला नवमी और दशमी को वृष्टि का होना शुभ है यदि उक्त दिनों में वृष्टि के बिना वायु का वेग होजावे तो अवश्य दुर्भिक्ष होता है।

 ४०२-४०३–आषाढ शुक्ला नवमी को सूर्य के उदयास्त काल में तो बादल न हों और मध्याह्न में बादल हों तो चातुर्मास्य में अकी वृष्टि होती है। किन्तु यदि सूर्य के उदयास्त के समय बादल हों और मध्याह्न में आकाश साफ रहै तो कुछ थोड़ी सी वृष्टि समझनी चाहिये।

 ४०४–यदि उक्त दिन सूर्य के उदय, अस्त और मध्याह्न काल में मेघ घिरा हुआ रहे तो वर्षाऋतु में वृष्टि होती है। और यदि तीनों काल में सूर्य साफ ही रहे तो वर्षा का अभाव समझना।

 ४०५–इसी दिन यदि सूर्य उदयकाल में तो स्वच्छ रहैं और मध्याह्न तथा अस्तकाल में मेघाच्छादित रहै तो वर्षा का अभाव रहता है और बड़ी नदी के अतिरिक्त कहीं जल नहीं मिलता।

 ४०६–किसी का मत है कि आषाढ शुक्ला नवमी को सूर्य का उदय, अस्त और मध्याह्न काल में मेघाच्छादित रहना अशुभ है।

 ४०७–आषाढ शुक्लपक्ष में पूर्वाह्न और अपराह्न काल में स्वाति बरस जावे तो आगे अच्छी वर्षा होती है और मध्याह्न में बरसने से कीट, सर्प आदि की सृष्टि अधिक होती है।

 ४०८–रात्रि के पूर्व भाग में स्वाती बरस जावे तो सब तरह के धान्य अधिक पैदा होते हैं और यदि मध्य रात्रि में स्वाती बरस जावे तो उड़द, मूंग और तिल की ही विशेष उत्पत्ति होती है।

 ४०९–रात्रि के आखिरी भाग में वर्षा होवे तो गरमी की फसल अच्छी होती है, शरद् की फसल ठीक नहीं होती। दिन रात ही यदि वर्षा होती रहे तो चातुर्मास्य में भी निरन्तर वर्षा होती है।

 ४१०–जो फल रोहिणी योग में कहा गया है वह स्वाती के योग में भी समझ लेना चाहिये। रोहिणी के योग में वायु को देखकर चौमासे में वर्षा कही गई वही यहाँ भी समझना।

 ४११–चित्रा, स्वाती और विशाखा नक्षत्रों में खूब वृष्टि रहे तो समय पर वर्षा का अभाव रहता है और दुर्भिक्ष का लक्षण रहता है। क्योंकि चित्रा में वायु का आरंभ, स्वाती में वायु की प्रधानता और विशाखा में वायु की हीनता रहती है।

**इति स्वाति परीक्षा।**

 दशमी का योग कहने के पश्चात अब क्रमागत एकादशी का फल कहते हैं।

 ४१२–आषाढ शुक्ल एकादशी के दिन शनि, मंगल अथवा रविवार हो और तेज हवा चले तो अन्न महँगा होजाता है।

 ४१३–यदि आषाढ शुक्ला एकादशी शनि, रवि और मंगलवार के साथ तिथि सम्पूर्ण अर्थात् ६० घड़ी न हो तो दुर्भिक्ष समझना चाहिये।

 ४१४–आषाढ शुक्ला एकादशी को वृष्टि होने से भाद्रपद कृष्ण में वर्षा होती है।

 ४१५–आषाढ शुक्ला द्वादशी को प्रचण्ड हवा चले तो यन करने पर कठिनता से वृष्टि हो। इसी प्रकार प्रतिपदा का भी फल समझना।

 ४१६–आषाढ शुक्ला चतुर्दशी को वर्षा होने से श्रावण कृष्णा एकादशी से श्रावण शुक्ला चतुर्थी तक (९ दिन) वर्षा होती है।

**आषाढी[^15]-परीक्षा।**

[^15]: "आषाढ शुक्ल पूर्णिमा की परीक्षा को आषाढी-परीक्षा कहते हैं।"

 ४१७-४१८–आषाढ शुक्ला पूर्णिमा के योग यदि सभी खराब होजायँ तो गर्भ को पुष्ट करने वाले सब योग नष्ट होजाते हैं। और यदि इस दिन के योग अच्छे होजायँ तो गर्भ के नाश करने वाले कुयोग भी सुयोग बन जाते हैं। इसीलिये इसकी विशेष परीक्षा लिखी जाती है।

 ४१९–आषाढी पूर्णिमा को चन्द्रग्रहण होवे तो साढेचार मास तक सब चीजें महँगी रहती हैं।

 ४२०–आषाढी पूर्णिमा में यदि बादलों के कारण चन्द्रमा दिखाई न दे तो वर्षा अच्छी होती है और यदि चन्द्रमा स्वच्छ दृष्टिगत होवे तो भयंकर अनावृष्टि समझनी चाहिये।

 ४२१–जिस देश के अन्दर इस पूर्णिमा में चन्द्रमा निर्बल अथवा मण्डल युक्त दिखाई देता हो उस देश में घोर दुर्भिक्ष होता है।

 ४२२–आषाढी पूर्णिमा को जितनी घड़ी मूल हो उतना ही दुर्भिक्ष समझना। अर्थात् इस दिन जितनी घड़ी मूल रहेगा उन घड़ियों की तिहाई संख्या के विस्वा का दुर्भिक्ष होगा।

 ४२३–आषाढी पूर्णिमा में मूल अथवा उत्तराषाढ नक्षत्र के होने से साल भर संपूर्ण देश में धान्य मध्यम रहता है।

 ४२४–आषाढी पूर्णिमा में पूर्वाषाढ नक्षत्र के होने से साल भर तक खूब धान्य पैदा होता है। सालभर प्रजा में सुख की वृद्धि होती है और वर्षा शुभ होती है।

 ४२५–आषाढ शुक्ला चतुर्दशी में पूर्णिमा की घड़ियाँ अधिक हो तो महँगाई रहती है अथवा भाव स्थिर रहता है, समान होने से समानता रहती है और यदि चतुर्दशी में पूर्णिमा की घड़ियों का सर्वथा ही अभाव हो तो धान्य प्राप्ति का भी सर्वथा अभाव रहता है। अर्थात् चतुर्दशी में पूर्णिमा की घड़ियाँ जितनी अधिक हों उतना ही अच्छा है।

 ४२६–आषाढी पूर्णिमा की वृद्धि अर्थात् इस तिथि के दो होने से एकमास तक मूल्य स्थिर रहता है पीछे अन्न का भाव तेज होजाता है।

 ४२७-४२८–आषाढी पूर्णिमा के दिन यदि यह तिथि ६० घड़ी की हो तो सालभर शुभ ही होता है, ३० घड़ी हो तो ६ मास और १५ घड़ी हो तो तीन मास शुभ होते हैं । इससे भी यदि कम हो तो दुःख ही समझना, किन्तु वायु और बादलों के योग से फल कुछ घट बढ जाता है।

 ४२९–आषाढी पूर्णिमा का परिमाण ६० घड़ी हो तो उसमें पाँच पाँच घड़ी के १२ विभाग करके एक एक विभाग के अनुसार एक एक मास का फल समझना चाहिये।

 ४३०–बारह भागों में से जिस भाग की रात्रि में चन्द्रमा अति निर्मल दिखाई देता हो उस भाग सम्बन्धी मास के जो गर्भ होवे वह उत्पातों से निश्चय नष्ट होजाते हैं।

 ४३१–किसी का मत है कि १२ भागों में से जिस भाग में आकाश स्वच्छ दिखाई देता हो उस भाग सम्बन्धी मास में वृष्टि का नाश अथवा अल्पवृष्टि वा वृष्टि के द्वारा हानि समझनी चाहिये।

 ४३२–साठ (६०) घड़ी की आषाढी पूर्णिमा के १२ भागों में जिस भाग में बद्दल रहे और पूर्व तथा उत्तर की वायु चले तो उस भाग सम्बन्धी मास में वृष्टि होती है। यह निर्णय सभी का है।

 ४३३–आषाढी पूर्णिमा के पहिले प्रहर में बादलों के होने से और पूर्व एवं उत्तर की वायु चलने से आद्यमास (कार्त्तिक) में अत्यन्त उपयुक्त वर्षा होती है।

 ४३४–आषाढी पूर्णिमा को रातभर बादल रहैं, उत्तर और पूर्व की हवा चले तो उस वर्ष अन्नकण मोटे पैदा हों और चातुर्मास्य में भी अच्छी वर्षा हो।

 ४३५–आषाढी पूर्णिमा को यदि वर्षा हुई न हो, पूरक्ष और उत्तर की हवा न चली हो और कुछ बादल भी न हुए हों तो वह वर्ष सर्वथा खराब समझलेना चाहिये।

 ४३६–हाँ यदि इस पूर्णिमा की रात्रि में चौतरफी हवा चल जाय तो वर्षा आदि शुभ शकुनों के न होने पर भी वह वर्ष शुभ ही समझलेना चाहिये।

 ४३७–आषाढी पूर्णिमा में बादल न भी हुए हों और वायु पूर्व और उत्तर की चलती हो तो ढाई घड़ी के तुल्य २४ विभागों में, जिस विभाग में वर्षा होती है, उसी उसी विभाग के अनुरूप आधे आधे मासों में वृष्टि समझनी चाहिये।

 ४३८–इस पूर्णिमा में बादल न भी हो, किन्तु वायु उत्तर और पूर्व की चलती हो तो २॥ घड़ी के जिस भाग में वर्षा होती है उसी के अनुसार मास के पक्ष में अवश्य वृष्टि होती है।

 ४३९–यदि आषाढी पूर्णिमा को ८ प्रहर पूर्व दिशा की हवा गर्भ के चिन्ह रूप में चलती रहे तो शीतकाल में होने वाले गर्भों का नाश नहीं होता।

अब इस पूर्णिमा की रातदिन वायु चलने का फल लिखते हैः—

 ४४०–आषाढी पूर्णिमा को रातदिन पूर्व को हवा चलने से अच्छी वर्षा होती है किन्तु मरुस्थल (मारवाड) और गुर्जर (गुजरात) देशों में दुर्भिक्ष होता है।

 ४४१–आषाढी पूर्णिमा को रातदिन अग्निकोण की हवा से अग्निभय, अल्पवृष्टि और सर्वत्र महँगाई रहती है और मारवाड की तो बडी दुर्दशा होती है।

 ४४२–इसी पूर्णिमा को दक्षिण की हवा चलने से अनावृष्टि, प्रजा को पीड़ा और धान्य की महँगाई रहती। नैऋत्य कोण की से अनावृष्टि और कठोर दुर्भिक्ष पड़ता है और महाभय होता है।

 ४४३–पश्चिमी वायु से महावृष्टि और धान्य की उत्पत्ति मध्यम होती है। वायव्य कोण की वायु से अनावृष्टि और वायु के दोष से देश की दुर्दशा होती है।

 ४४४–उत्तरी वायु से भी महावृष्टि होती है और ईशान कोण की वायु से वर्षा अच्छी होती है। ऊर्ध्व वायु से दुर्भिक्ष और तेज हवा से वर्षा का नाश समझना चाहिये।

 ४४५–आषाढी पूर्णिमा के दिन पूर्व, दक्षिण, पश्चिम और उत्तर से क्रमशः बायु चले तो अल्पवृष्टि होगी। और यदि पूर्व उत्तर, पश्चिम और दक्षिण के क्रम से वायु चले तो सुमित और क्षेम होगा।

 ४४६–यदि चारों ओर की वायु एक दूसरी हवा को रोकती हुई चले तो खण्डवृष्टि और धान्य तथा तृण (घास) का नाश होगा।

किसी वायु के रोकने से कैसा फल मिलता है, यह क्रम से लिखते हैः—

 ४४७–अनिष्ट वायु अच्छी वायु को रोक लेता है, तो जल नहीं बरसता और यदि अच्छी वायु अनिष्ट वायु को रोक लेता है तो अच्छी वर्षा होती है।

 ४४८–दक्षिण की वायु यदि पूर्व की वायु को नष्ट करती हो तो अनावृष्टि समझना। यदि वायु रुक जावे तो श्रावण, भाद्र में पर्याप्त वर्षा होगी।

 दिनरात की वायु का लक्षण लिखने के अनन्तर अब केवल सूर्यास्त काल की वायु की परीक्षा लिखते हैं—

 ४४९–अमावास्या को गिनकर ठीक उसके १६ वें दिन सायंकाल के समय हवा और बादलों की परीक्षा करके सालभर का शुभा शुभ समझना चाहिये।

 ४५०–आषाढी पूर्णिमा को सूर्य जब आधा अस्त होजाय तब वायु की परीक्षा करे। उस समय यदि पूर्व, ईशान अथवा उत्तर की वायु चले तो शुभ समय समझना चाहिये।

 ४५१–सूर्य के उसी अर्धास्त के समय यदि अग्निकोण, नैऋत्यकोण वा वायव्यकोण की वायु चले तो दुर्भिक्ष होता है। पश्चिम और दक्षिण की हवा चले तो आधा समय शुभ और आधा समय अशुभ निकलता है।

 ४५२–किसी का मत है कि आषाढी पूर्णिमा को पूर्व की वायु से सुभिक्ष, अनिको की से गर्मी, दक्षिण की से वृष्टि, नैऋत्य की से अल्पवृष्टि, पश्चिम की से सम (साधारण) वृष्टि, वायव्य की से उत्तम वर्षा, उत्तर की से बहुत वायु युक्त वर्षा और ईशानकोण की वायु चलने से शुभ वृष्टि होती है।

 ४५३–आषाढ पूर्णिमा को यदि पूर्व और उत्तर की हवा न चली हो और बादल तथा जल भी न गिरा हो तो चारों ओर दुर्भिक्ष ही समझ लेना चाहिये।

 ४५४–आषाढी पूर्णिमा का यदि बिजली, गर्जना और वर्षा होजाय तो दुर्भिक्ष के जो लक्षण पहिले हुए हों वे नष्ट होजाते हैं और सर्वत्र आनन्द ही होता है।

**इति आषाढ पूर्णिमा परीक्षा।**

  क्रमागत अब आषाढ कृष्ण (आज कल के हिसाब से श्रावण कृष्ण) की परीक्षा लिखते हैं—

 ४५५–श्रवण और अषाढ़ (पूर्वाषाढ़, उत्तराषाढ़) नक्षत्रों में गुरु, बुध, भृगु और चन्द्रवार के होने से सुभिक्ष और रवि, भौम, शनिवार के होने से दुर्भिक्ष आदि अशुभ फल मिलते हैं।

 ४५६–आषाढ़ कृष्णा चतुर्थी को पूर्वभाद्रपद नक्षत्र के होने पर यदि गर्जना के साथ वर्षा होजाय तो वर्षाऋतु उत्तम समझनी और यही फल पंचमी का समझना चाहिये।

 ४५७–आषाढ़ कृष्णा चतुर्थी को यदि सूर्य का उदय बादलों में हो या बिजली अथवा गर्जना हो रही हो तो तीन मास तक वर्षा होती है।

 ४५८–आषाढ़ कृष्णा चतुर्थी को रातदिन वर्षा होते रहने से दो मास ही केवल वर्षा होती है इसके पश्चात् वह नष्ट होजाती है।

 ४५९–आषाढ़ कृष्णा चतुर्थी को सूर्य के अस्त होने पर यदि न बादल हुए हो और न जल बरसा हो तो उस वर्ष में वर्षा कष्ट से होती है।

 ४६०–आषाढ़ कृष्णा चतुर्थी में यदि तुषार (पाला) भी पड़ जाय तो भी जल का क्लेश नहीं रहता और सब शुभ ही होता है।

 ४६१–आषाढ़ कृष्णपक्ष में अश्विनी नक्षत्र के दिन घनघटा से सृष्टि होजावे तो यह सब दोषों को दूर करके सुभिक्ष करती है।

 ४६२–आषाढ़ कृष्णा पंचमी में आकाश का निर्मल रहना शुभ है। इस से १८ प्रहर के पश्चात् वर्षा होती है।

 ४६३–आषाढ़ कृष्णा पंचमी को यदि न बादल हों और न बिजली ही चमकी हो तो उस वर्ष वर्षा का अभाव समझना। खेती करना वृथा ही है।

 ४६४–आषाढ़ कृष्णा पंचमी को वर्षा होने से चारों महीनों में खूब वृष्टि होती है।

 ४६५–आषाढ़ कृष्णा पंचमी को वायु न चले अथवा अधिक चले तो प्रबल दुर्भिक्ष होता है।

 ४६६–आषाढ़ कृष्णा पंचमी को पश्चिमी वायु चले, गर्जना हो और इन्द्रधनुष दीखे तथा वर्षा भी होजावे तो कार्तिक में महँगाई होजाती है।

 ४६७–आषाढ़ कृष्णा सप्तमी को शनिवार होने से अच्छी वर्षा होती है और अष्टमी को रविवार के होने से वर्ष शुभ होता है।

 ४६८-४६९–आषाढ़ कृष्णा अष्टमी को दक्षिण की हवा से दुर्भिक्ष, पूर्व की से खण्डवृष्टि और पश्चिम की हवा से अच्छी वृष्टि होती है। यदि उत्तर की वायु चले तो श्रावण में खूब वर्षा होगी और यदि गर्जना के साथ वृष्टि भी होजावे तो चातुर्मास्य भर में अच्छी वर्षा होगी।

 ४७०–आषाढ़ कृष्णा अष्टमी को निर्मल आकाश में चन्द्रोदय होने से अनावृष्टि और मेघाच्छादित आकाश में चन्द्रोदय होने से सुवृष्टि होती है।

 ४७१–आषाढ़ कृष्णा नवमी को गुरु, शुक्र और चन्द्रवार का होना शुभ है और मंगल, रवि अथवा शनिवार का होना दुर्भिक्ष का सूचक है।

 ४७२–आषाढ़ कृष्णा नवमी को बिजली चमके तो सुभिक्ष और सुवृष्टि हो।

 ४७३–आषाढ़ में कृत्तिका नक्षत्र के होने पर यदि जल गिर जाय तो पृथ्वी में खूब धन, धान्य और जल होता है।

 ४७४–आषाढ़ कृष्ण सप्तमी, दशमी और एकादशी को सन्ध्या समय में मेघ के चिह्न मालूम हो तो तीन रात तक वृष्टि समझनी चाहिये।

 ४७५–आषाढ़ कृष्णा में पाँच रात तक यदि अनवरत कुछ कुछ मेघ बरसता रहै अर्थात्झड़ी लगी रहे तो ज्येष्ठमास में मूलनक्षत्र के बरस जाने पर भी अच्छी वर्षा होती है।

 ४७६–आषाढ़ कृष्णा एकादशी को सूर्योदय यदि बादलों से आच्छादित हो अथवा उस समय बिजली चमके, गर्जना या वर्षा हो तो सुभिक्ष समझ लेना चाहिये।

**रोहिणी योगः।**

 ४७७–आषाढ़ के कृष्णपक्ष में चन्द्रमा से संगत हुई रोहिणी (तारा) को देखना चाहिए। चन्द्रमा के प्रमाण और वर्ण अर्थात् चन्द्रमा से कितनी दूरी पर तथा किस वर्ण वाली है यह देखकर उसके मार्ग और वायु से उसका आगे लिखे क्रमानुसार फल कहना चाहिये।

 ४७८– नगर से उत्तर वा पूर्व में भूमि शोध करके वहाँ अच्छा स्थंडिल (वेदी, चबूतरा) बनाकर और उस पर कुशा बिछा कर अग्निहोत्र करता हुआ तीन दिन तक रहे।

 ४७९–रत्नौषधियों के जल से भरे हुए प्रवाल (आम या अशोक के नये पल्लव) से ढके हुए

 और जिनके वैदे काले न हों ऐसे चार घड़ों को वहाँ चारों दिशाओं में रक्खे।

 ४८०–जिन चीजों को बोना हो उनके बीजों को महाव्रत (वैदिक) मन्त्र के द्वारा उठाकर घड़े में डाल दे और सुवर्ण, कुश तथा जल से हिलादे।

 ४८१–हिलाने के पश्चात् मरुत्, वरुण और सोम देवताओं के मन्त्रों से हवन करे। रोहिणी योग के अन्त में ऊगे हुए बीजों को देखकर फल का विचार करे। अर्थात् अच्छा अङ्कुरित हो तो फसल अच्छी, थोड़ा अङ्कुरित होने से थोड़ी और अङ्कुरित न होने से फसल भी नहीं पैदा होगी।

 ४८२–रोहिणी और चन्द्रमा का योग होने पर दिक्साधन की विधि से दिक्साधन (दिशा का शोधन) करके वायु परीक्षा करे।

 ४८३–बारह हाथ के ऊँचे बाँस में काले रंग की चिकनी, सुन्दर, चार हाथ लम्बी ध्वजा लगाओ।

 ४८४–ध्वजा की लहर बाँई तरफ उठकर चले और दाहिनी ओर को जाय तो शुभ फल समझो और दाहिनी ओर से उठकर चले और बाँई तरफ को जाय तो अशुभ समझना चाहिये। जिधर को ध्वजा की रुख हो उसी दिशा में वायु का बल रहता है।

 ४८५–पूर्व की वायु से धान्य, अग्निकोण की से गर्मी, दक्षिण की से धान्यनाश, नैऋत्य की से महँगाई, पश्चिम की से वृष्टि, वायव्य की से वायु सहित वर्षा, उत्तर की से सुवृष्टि और ईशानकोण की वायु चलने से कल्याण होता है।

 ४८६–रोहिणी में वायु के योग से चातुर्मास्य की परीक्षा की जाती है। आठों प्रहरो में चातुर्मास्य आठ पक्षों की कल्पना करनी चाहिये और एक एक प्रहर के पन्द्रहवें भाग अर्थात् आधी आधी घड़ी के विभाग से एक एक दिन के फल को समझना चाहिये।

 ४८७–जिस दिशा से मेघ उठकर जारहे हों उसी दिशा की वायु समझनी चाहिये और उनका फल भी उसी वायु के समान समझना चाहिये।

 ४८८–बादल कई प्रकार के होते हैं-कहीं श्वेत, कहीं कृष्ण, कहीं दोनों रंग के, कहीं जिनके उदर और पीठ टेढ़े मेढ़े हैं ऐसे सर्पाकार मेघ होते हैं।

 ४८९–कहीं सूर्य की किरणों से रंगे हुए प्रान्त भागवाले, कहीं कमल के मध्य भाग के सदृश कहीं केसर, किंशुक और भौंरों के समान विचित्र वर्षा के मेघ होते हैं।

 ४९०–कहीं काले रंग के, कहीं बिजली से घिरे हुए, कहीं इन्द्रधनुष से युक्त और कहीं काजल के पहाड़ के समान मेघ होते हैं।

 ४९१–सन्ध्या के समय आकाश के कुछ रंग जाने पर भिन्न भिन्न स्थान में विद्यमान मेघ कहीं इन्दीवर (नीलकमल) समान श्याम रंग के, कहीं मोती तथा वर्फ के समान श्वेत शोभित होते हैं।

 ४९२–कहीं पर तो बादल उन हाथियों के समान शोभित होते हैं जिनके कक्षभाग (कोंख) में बिजली के समान सुवर्ण मौजूद हैं, शुण्डादरड से जो शोभित हैं और जिनके गण्डस्थल बह रहे हैं।

 ४९३-४९४–जिनका एक अंग (भाग) काला है, आकाश में फैलकर जो दिगन्तों में फैले हुए हैं, जिनमें मन्दगर्जना होरही है, भूमि पर लटके हुए जल गिरा रहे हैं, इस प्रकार विचित्र बादलों के समूह यदि दो या तीन दिन आकाश में छाये हुए रहैं तो वृष्टि अवश्य होती है।

 ४९५–यदि शब्द-शून्य, रूखे, पतले, वायु द्वारा छिन्न भिन्न भाग वाले, ऊँट, मर्कट, काक आदि दुष्ट जीवों की आकृति वाले बादल हों तो वर्षा नहीं होगी।

 ४९६–यदि रोहिणी के दक्षिणी भाग से चन्द्रमा की गति हो तो दुःख होता है और रोहिणी के उत्तर भाग से चन्द्रमा की गति हो तो खूब वर्षा होती है।

 ४९७–चन्द्रमा यदि रोहिणी के उत्तर भाग से रोहिणी के स्थान को स्पर्श करे तो वृष्टि विधायक होता हुआ भी वह अनेक उपद्रवों को करता है।

 ४९८–चन्द्रमा यदि रोहिणी के शकट को भेद कर जावे तो घोर अनावृष्टि होती है और पृथ्वी पर दुर्भिक्ष पड़ता है।

 ४९९–यदि रोहिणी की गति चन्द्रमा के पीछे हो तो कामातुर स्त्रियाँ विशेषतः पुरुषों के वश में रहती हैं।

 ५००–अथवा चन्द्रमा की गति रोहिणी के पीछे हो सो कामुक पुरुष स्त्रियों के वश में होजाते हैं।

 ५०१–उदयकाल में चन्द्रमा यदि रोहिणी से आग्नेयकोण में रहे तो आपत्तियाँ होती हैं। इसी तरह अस्तकाल में चन्द्रमा रोहिणी से नैऋत्य में अस्त होवे तो छः प्रकार की ईतियों के द्वारा धान्य का नाश होता है।

 ५०२–चन्द्रमा यदि रोहिणी से वायव्यकोंण में रहता हुआ अस्त होवे तो धान्य-वृद्धि अच्छी होती है। इसी प्रकार उदयकाल में चन्द्रमा यदि रोहिणी से ईशानकोण में रहे तो भी धान्य-वृद्धि आदि नाना संपत्तियाँ पैदा होती हैं।

 ५०३–चन्द्रमा यदि रोहिणीवारे को ताडना (अर्थात् अपने प्रकाश से रोहिणीतारे का अभिभव करता हो तो) इससे बड़ा भय समझना। किसी स्त्री के द्वारा राजा की, मृत्यु होती है।

 ५०४–रोहिणी से युक्त चन्द्रमा यदि मेघों के कारण न दिखाई दे तो धान्य भी बहुत होता जल भी खूब बरसता है किन्तु पृथ्वी पर रोग अधिक फैलता है।

 ५०५–आषाढ़ कृष्ण एकादशी को रोहिणी नक्षत्र के होने पर यदि वर्षा होजावे तो हरि के उठने तक अर्थात् कार्त्तिक शुक्ला (देव प्रबोधिनी) एकादशी तक वृष्टि होती रहती है।

 ५०६–पराशर महर्षि का मत है कि—सूर्य को ककराशि पर रहते हुए और चन्द्र को रोहिणी पर रहते हुए यदि वर्षा न हो तो दुर्भिक्ष होता है।

 ५०७–आषाढ़ कृष्णा एकादशी को कृत्तिका होने से समान (साधारण) फल,रोहिणीनक्षत्र होने से सुभिक्ष और मृगशीर्ष के होने से दुर्भिक्ष होता है।

 ५०८–आषाढ़ कृष्णा एकादशी में जितनी घड़ी तक रोहिणी रहे उतनी घड़ियों के तिहाई बिस्वे धान्य पैदा होता है।

 ५०९–आषाढ़ कृष्णा एकादशी को उत्तर की हवा चले और सूर्योदय मेघाच्छन्न हो तो अत्यन्त शुभ समझना चाहिये।

 ५१०–आषाढ़ कृष्णा एकादशी को यदि कुछ भी वर्षा हो जावे तो यह योग शुभ समझना चाहिए, इससे आगे अच्छी वर्षा होती है।

 ५११–आषाढ़ कृष्णा एकादशी को अर्धरात्रि के समय यदि गर्जना होजावे तो दुर्भिक्ष और अनावृष्टि समझलेना चाहिये।

 ५१२–आषाढ़ कृष्णा एकादशी को यदि रोहिणी का योग होजावे तो आकाश के निर्मल होने पर भी, तीव्रता के साथ सूर्य के तपते रहने पर भी और रात को तारा चमकने पर भी अच्छी वर्षा समझलेनी चाहिए। अर्थात् इसमें कुयोग होते हुए भी एक रोहिणी योग से अच्छी वर्षा हो जाती है।

 ५१३–किसी का मत है कि आषाढ़ कृष्णा दशमी में रोहिणी के योग से सुभिक्ष ही होता है, किन्तु एकादशी में समता और द्वादशी में रोहिणी योग से दुर्भिक्ष होता है।

 ५१४–त्रयोदशी में रोहिणी के योग से तेज हवा चलती है। कई व्यक्तियों का विचार है कि ज्येष्ठ में कहे हुए रोहिणी के फल को आषाढ़ में भी मानो।

 ५१५–आषाढ़ में जिस दिन रोहिणी का योग हो उस दिन वायु पूर्वोत्तर की हो तो श्रेष्ठ शकुन समझना चाहिये और उस समय बादल, वृष्टि और बिजली का होना भी वर्षाकाल का शुभ शकुन है।

**इति रोहिणी योगः।**

 एकादशी को रोहिणी का योग लिखने के पश्चात् अत्र क्रमागत इससे आगे की तिथियों की परीक्षा लिखते हैं।

 ५१६–आषाढ़ की अमावास्या को वृष्टि हो और बादल छाये रहें तो यह शकुन शुभ इससे सुभिक्ष होता है।

 ५१७–आषाढ़ की अमावास्या में सायंकाल यदि गर्भ के चिन्ह दिखाई देते हों तो शीघ्र ही वर्षा का आगमन समझलेना चाहिये। पूर्व दिशा में धूम्रवर्ण का बादल होकर सूर्यास्त होने पर काला हो जावे तो उसी रात में वर्षो आवेगी।

 ५१८– इस अमावास्या को उत्तर दिशा में मेघों के समूह हों, किन्तु प्रातःकाल दिशाएँ निर्मल दीखती हो, मध्याह्न में धूप हो तो अर्धरात्रि में वर्षा समझनी चाहिए।

 ५१९–आषाढ़ी अमावास्या को पुष्य, अश्लेषा अथवा मघा के होने से वह वर्ष मध्यम (साधारण) कहना चाहिये क्योंकि उस वर्ष अधिक वर्षा नहीं होगी।

 ५२०–आषाढ़ मास में सूर्य संक्रान्ति के दिन यदि मेघ बरस जावे तो उस मास में घोर रोग पैदा होता है और पुनः श्रावण में शान्ति प्राप्त होती है।

 ५२१–श्रावण शुक्लपक्ष में यदि सिंहराशि के ऊपर सूर्य का संक्रमण (आगमन) हो तो समुद्र में अर्थात् समुद्र प्रान्त देशों में पूर्ण वर्षा होगी किन्तु अन्य देशों में कहीं कहीं ही वर्षा होगी।

 ५२२–कर्क की संक्रान्ति में वर्षा हो और सिंह की संक्रान्ति में वर्षा न हो तो कन्या की संक्रान्ति आने पर वायु रहित वर्षा हो।

 ५२३–कर्क राशि पर जब सूर्य का प्रवेश होता हो उस समय वृहस्पति यदि सूर्य को पूर्ण अथवा चौथाई दृष्टि से भी देखता हो तो उस वर्ष अच्छी वृष्टि होती है।

 ५२४–कर्कसंक्रान्ति के दिन से १० दिनों के भीतर यदि बुध का उदय होजावे तो श्रावण शुक्ला में अच्छी वृष्टि होती है।

 ५२५–इसी तरह सिंहसंक्रान्ति के काल से दश दिनों के भीतर यदि बुध का उदय होजाय तो श्रावण शुक्ला में अच्छी वृष्टि होती है।

 ५२६–श्रावण में यदि शुक्र का अस्त और बुध का उदय हो तो भाद्रपद में वर्षा का अभाव समझना चाहिये।

 ५२७–कर्कराशि पर बृहस्पति, सिंह राशि पर शुक्र और तुला पर मंगल हो तो आषाढ़ कृष्णा (श्रावण कृष्णा) में अनावृष्टि और श्रावण शुक्ल में कलह (उपद्रव) होता है ।

 ५२८–सिंहराशि पर शुक्र के होने से अनावृष्टि होती है, यदि अनावृष्टि न होकर अतिवृष्टि होजावे तो कार्त्तिक में अनेक रोग पैदा होंगे।

 ५२९–श्रावण शुक्ला चतुर्थी को उदय होता हुआ सूर्य यदि बादलों के कारण दिखाई न देवे तो पुष्य का सूर्य वर्षा नहीं करेगा।

 ५३०–श्रावण शुक्ला पञ्चमी को पश्चिम, दक्षिण अर्थात् नैऋत्यकोण की हवा ले और दो दिन तक वर्षा होती रहे तो दुर्भिक्ष समझना चाहिये।

 ५३१–श्रावण शुक्ला पञ्चमी को वृष्टि अथवा केवल बादल ही रहे तो चार मास अर्थात्श्रावण से कार्त्तिक तक खूब वर्षा समझनी चाहिए।

 ५३२–श्रावण शुक्ला सप्तमी को (स्वाति नक्षत्र पर) सूर्य के उदयास्त मेघाच्छन्न रहे तभी वृष्टि की आशा रखनी चाहिये, अन्यथा नहीं।

 ५३३–श्रावण शुक्ला सप्तमी को (स्वातिनक्षत्र पर) सूर्यास्त होने पर यदि न मेघ बरसे और न बादल ही हुए हों तो अनावृष्टि समझ लेनी चाहिये। यह भी किसी का मत है।

 ५३४–श्रावण शुक्ला सप्तमी को चन्द्रमा यदि हस्त नक्षत्र पर आवे तो घोर दुर्भिक्ष होता है। जल दायिनी तिथि होते हुए भी जल नहीं बरसता ।

 ५३५–श्रावण शुक्ला सप्तमी को स्वाति नक्षत्र के होने पर वर्षा होने से सब धान्यों की उत्पत्ति और प्रजा को शान्ति प्राप्त होती है।

 ५३६–श्रावण शुक्ला सप्तमी को स्वाति नक्षत्र के रहते हुए यदि सूर्योदय होवे और वर्षा भी हो तो पृथ्वी पर जल ही जल दृष्टि में आता है।

 ५३७–श्रावण में चित्रा, स्वाति और विशाखा नक्षत्रों में वर्षा न होने से उन देशों में न वृष्टि और न धान्योत्पत्ति होती है।

 ५३८–श्रावण शुक्ला अष्टमी को प्रातःकाल के समय मेघ छाये हुए हों और सूर्य ढका हुआ हो तो महावृष्टि होती है।

 ५३९–श्रावण के शुक्लपक्ष की चतुर्थी, पञ्चमी, सप्तमी और चतुर्दशी को यदि वर्षा हो तो शुभ शकुन समझने चाहिये, किन्तु पूर्णिमा के दिन श्रवण नक्षत्र नहीं होना चाहिये ।

 ५४०–श्रावण शुक्ला दशमी को शनिवार के होने पर यदि सूर्य सिंहराशि पर आवे तो पृथ्वी पर खूब वर्षा और धान्य की समृद्धि होती है।

 ५४१–श्रावण शुक्ला पूर्णिमा को श्रवण नक्षत्र हो, किन्तु वर्षा न हुई हो तो सुभिक्ष ही समझना चाहिये। यह ज्योतिषियों का विचार है।

 ५४२–श्रावण की पूर्णिमा को चन्द्रमा यदि बादलों से ढका रहै तो शुभ समझना, किन्तु कई कहते हैं कि बादल रहित आकाश का स्वच्छ रहना ही शुभ है।

 ५४३–श्रावण की पूर्णिमा को चन्द्रग्रहण होने से यमुना तक कान्यकुब्ज देश में अर्थात्कानपुर के जिले, मथुरा प्रयाग के बीच में रस और मूल (कन्द) नहीं मिलते।

 श्रावण शुक्ला की परीक्षा लिखकर अब श्रावण कृष्णपक्ष की (आज कल के व्यवहार से भाद्र कृष्ण की परीक्षा लिखते हैं—

 ५४४–जिस वर्ष में श्रावण कृष्णा प्रतिपदा को श्रवण नक्षत्र और गुरुवार हो, वह संवत्सर शुभ समझना चाहिये। उस वर्ष सब धान्य पैदा होते हैं।

 ५४५–श्रावण कृष्णा द्वितीया को चन्द्रमा के न दीखने से वर्ष शुभ समझा जाता है और धान्य अच्छा पैदा होता है।

 ५४६–श्रावण कृष्णा तृतीया को तीसरे प्रहर में उत्तर की तरफ वादलों के होने से सुख होता है, किन्तु छठे मास में महँगाई होजाती हैं।

 ५४७–श्रावण कृष्णा चतुर्थी को शनिवार के होने से दुर्भिक्ष और देश का नाश समझना चाहिए।

 ५४८-५४९–श्रावण कृष्णा सप्तमी को रोहिणी और गुरु, शुक्र, शनि अथवा रविवार के होने से तीसरे महीने के अन्त में जौ, गेहूं, चावल, गुड़, खांड आदि गन्ने की चीजें, तिल, हींग जीरा और हलदी ये वस्तुएँ महँगी होजाती हैं।

 ५५०–श्रावण कृष्ण अष्टमी को यदि रोहिणी नक्षत्र हो तो सुभिक्ष और प्रजा को सुख प्राप्त होता है।

 ५५१–श्रावण कृष्णा अमावास्या को रविवार और पश्चिम दिशा में इन्द्रधनुष हो तो अन्न की महँगाई और प्रजा को पीड़ा की प्राप्ति होती हैI

 ५५२–भाद्रपद शुक्ला प्रतिपदा, सप्तमी, द्वादशी, त्रयोदशी और पूर्णिमा के दिन पश्चिम में बादलों के होने से अच्छी वर्षा होती है।

 ५५३–भाद्रपद शुक्ला द्वितीया को चन्द्रमा यदि न दीखे तो वर्ष भर में धान्य की अच्छी उत्पत्ति होती है।

 ५५४–भाद्रपद शुक्ला तृतीया को मंगलवार और उत्तराफाल्गुनी नक्षत्र हो तो बड़ी बड़ी घटाएँ भी वर्षा नहीं करेंगी।

 ५५५–भाद्रपद शुक्ला चतुर्थी को गुरुवार के होने पर उत्तराफाल्गुनी नक्षत्र के होने से, सोमवार के होने पर हस्त नक्षत्र के होने से और भृगुवार के होने पर चित्रा नक्षत्र के होने से निस्सन्देह सुभिक्ष होता है।

 ५५६– निमित्त (लक्षण) शास्त्र जानने वाले कहते हैं कि भाद्रपद शुक्ला पंचमी को स्वाती नक्षत्र के होने से सुभिक्ष समझना चाहिए।

 ५५७–भाद्र शुक्ला पंचमी को यदि वर्षा न होवे तो यह दुष्ट योग समझना चाहिए। किसी दैव कोप से दुर्भिक्ष पड़ता है।

 ५५८–भाद्रपद शुक्ला षष्ठी को अनुराधा नक्षत्र के आ जाने से अन्य नक्षत्रों के दोष होने पर भी निस्संदेह सुभिक्ष होता है।

 ५५९–भाद्रपद शुक्ला षष्ठी को अनुराधा नक्षत्र हो और वर्षा बिजली तथा खूब बादल भी हों तो धान्य की अधिक उत्पत्ति समझनी चाहिए।

 ५६०–भाद्र शुक्ला षष्ठी को अनुराधा नक्षत्र होने पर बिजली, गर्जना और वर्षों होजावे तो श्रावण के महीने में स्वाती नक्षत्र के बरस जाने पर भी कोई हानि नहीं होती, सुभिक्ष होता ही है।

 ५६१–किसी का मत है कि भाद्रपद शुक्ला षष्ठी को अनुराधा नक्षत्र चाहे हो, किन्तु बिजली गर्जना और वर्षा न हुई हो तो उस देश में दुर्भिक्ष ही समझना चाहिये।

 ५६२–भाद्रपद शुक्ला सप्तमी को अनुराधा नक्षत्र होने से अनावृष्टि होती है, जल नहींबरसता।

 ५६३–भाद्रपद शुक्ला में चित्रा, स्वाती और विशाखा नक्षत्रों के दिन वर्षा न होने से चातुर्मास्य की समाप्ति समझ लेनी चाहिये। अर्थात् वृष्टि की आशा नहीं करनी चाहिये।

 ५६४–प्रावृट् के अन्त में भाद्रपद के शुक्ल पक्ष में अनुराधा नक्षत्र के दिन बादल, गर्जना और बिजली हो तो पूर्ण सुभिक्ष कहना चाहिये।

 ५६५–भाद्रपद शुक्ला सप्तमी को वर्षा, गर्जना, बिजली और बादल भी न हुए हों तो निश्चय ही कठोर दुर्भिक्ष समझ लेना चाहिये।

 ५६६–भाद्रपद शुक्ला अष्टमी को यदि मूलनक्षत्र में चन्द्र और रविवार से युक्त हो तो पाँचवे महीने में सन की चीजें महँगी होजाती हैं।

 ५६७–भाद्रपद शुक्ला चतुर्थी, पंचमी, सप्तमी, अष्टमी और पूर्णिमा को गर्भ के लक्षण दिखाई देने से शीघ्र ही मेघ का श्रागमन समझना चाहिये।

 ५६८–कुछ दिनों से आरंभ करके पंचमी या सप्तमी तिथि में पृथिवी तक समुद्र की तरह दृष्टि गत होवे और भाद्र शुक्ला नवमी में वृष्टि होजावे तो दुष्काल की आशा करनी चाहिये।

 ५६९–भाद्रपद शुक्ला दशमी को मूलनक्षत्र और रविवार के योग होने से दुर्भिक्ष होता है। किन्तु यह योग अन्य तिथियों में हो तो सुभिक्ष होता है।

 ५७०–भाद्रपद शुक्ला एकादशी के दिन बादलों का घिर जाना सुभिक्ष का सूचक है। यदि रात में गर्जना होवे तो इससे टिडियों का उत्पात होता है।

 ५७१–भाद्रपद की पूर्णिमा को यदि चन्द्रग्रहण हो तो दो महीने के पश्चात् रस और मूल दुर्लभ होजाते हैं।

 शुक्ल पक्ष की परीक्षा के पश्चात् अब भाद्र कृष्ण (व्यवहार से अश्विन कृष्ण) की परीक्षा लिखते हैं—

 ५७२–भाद्रपद कृष्णा चतुर्थी को सूर्योदय के समय बादलों का होना संसार की कुशलता और वर्षा का शुभ सूचक है।

 ५७३–भाद्रपद की अमावास्या को शनिवार के होने से सस्ताई नहीं रहती कहीं कहीं पर तो दुर्भिक्ष भी पड़ जाता है।

 ५७४–भाद्रपद कृष्णा की प्रतिपदा, पंचमी, त्रयोदशी और अमावास्या को पूर्व दिशा से उठे हुये मेघों से पाँच योजन (२० कोस) तक वर्षा होती है।

 ५७५–भाद्रपद में पश्चिम की वायु चले तो मेघ का अभाव समझना चाहिए कदाचित् वर्षा हो जावे तो अनेक दिनतक प्रचण्ड वायु के साथ वर्षा होती रहेगी।

 ५७६–भाद्र में यदि चौतरफ़ी वायु चले तो घटा उमड़ उमड़ कर भी यही चली जाय और वर्षा नहीं करे।

 ५७७–सिंह की संक्रान्ति के दिन वृष्टि न होना शुभ है यदि दो दिन के पश्चात् बादल या वृष्टि हो जावे तो कोई हानि नहीं।

 ५७८–भाद्रपद की चतुर्दशी और सूर्य संक्रान्ति के दिन वर्षा होने से नाना रोग पैदा होते हैं और आश्विन में भी शुभ नहीं होता।

**इति भाद्रपद मासः।**

श्रवणं च धनिष्ठा च तदा दुर्भिक्षसंभवः॥५८५॥**

**आश्विनस्य त्रयोदश्यां शनिवारो भवेद् यदि।

**नक्षत्रे वा तिथौ गर्भ योगा उक्ताः शुभाशुभाः।  
यत्र वर्षे शुभाधिक्यं तत्रानन्दः प्रवर्तते॥५९१॥**

 ५७९–आश्विन के शुक्लपक्ष की चतुर्थी और पंचमी तिथि गर्भ सिद्धि की परवाह नहीं करती। तात्कालिक ग्रह योग से इन दिनों में जो वर्षा होती हैं, वह शुभ हैं।

 ५८०–श्रश्विन शुक्ला चतुर्थी और पंचमी में भी शीघ्र ही गर्भ होजावे तो पाँच सात दिनों में हीं पृथिवी एक समुद्र के समान होजाती है।

 ५८१–आश्विन शुक्ला चतुर्थी को सूर्योदय के समय श्वेत बादल होने से संसार के कल्याण के लिये अच्छी वर्षा होती है।

 ५८२–आश्विन शुक्ला प्रतिपदा, अष्टमी और दशमी को आकाश में बादलों की घटा दिखाई देने से तत्काल वृष्टि होती है।

 ५८३–आश्विन में सूर्यास्त के समय आकाश में पर्वताकार मेघों के होने से उसी दिन वर्षा आती है।

 ५८४–आश्विन के शुक्लपक्ष की सप्तमी और अष्टमी यदि जलयुक्त हो तो सुभिक्ष होता है। इस तरह निमित्त शास्त्र के जानने वाले ज्योतिषी कहते हैं।

 ५८५–आश्विन शुक्ला सप्तमी को शनिवार के आने पर श्रवण और धनिष्ठा नक्षत्र का भी यदि उस दिन योग होजाय तो दुर्भिक्ष की संभावना समझनी चाहिये।

 ५८६–आश्विन शुक्ला त्रयोदशी को शनिवार हो और यदि संक्रान्ति भी हो तो पृथिवी में अन्न खूब पैदा होता है।

 ५८७–आश्विन की पूर्णिमा को चन्द्रग्रहण हो तो दो महीने की समाप्ति में सब धान्य महंगे होजाते हैं।

 शुक्लपक्ष के पश्चात् आश्विन कृष्णा (व्यवहार से कार्त्तिक कृष्णा) की परीक्षा लिखते हैं।

 ५८८–आश्विन कृष्ण की अमावास्या (वर्तमान हिसाब से कार्तिक कृष्ण की अमावास्या) अर्थात् दीपमालिका के दिन शनि, रवि अथवा मंगलवार हो, स्वाती नक्षत्र हो और आयुष्मान्नाम का योग हो तो प्रलय के तुल्य वह काल समझना चाहिए।

 ५८९–दीपमालिका की अमावास्या के दिन स्वाती नक्षत्र का होना खराब योग है। गोक्रीड़ा अर्थात् गोवर्धन पूजा विशाखा नक्षत्र में हो तो पैदा हुआ अन्न भी नष्ट होजाता है।

 ५९०–आश्विन के महीने में शनैश्वर बक्रो हो, बुध अन्य राशि पर जाता हो और शुक्र अस्त हो रहा हो तो पृथिवी में खूब अन्न पैदा होता है।

 ५९१–नक्षत्र और तिथि के शुभ और अशुभ गर्भयोग कह चुके हैं। जिस वर्ष मेंशुभ योम अधिक हों उस वर्ष में आनन्द होता है।

 कार्तिक से आश्विन मास तक के बारहों महीनों के तिथियों की विस्तृत परीक्षा लिखने के अनन्तर अब प्रत्येक मास की खास खास परीक्षा लिखते हैं।

 ५९२-५९३–माघ में शीत न पड़े, फाल्गुन में वायु न बहे, चैत्र में बादल न हो, वैशाख मास में ओले गिरें और ज्येष्ठ में प्रचण्ड धूप पड़े तो वर्षाऋतु में बहुत कम वृष्टि होती है।

 ५९४–माघ में यदि बादलों की घटा न हो, चैत्र में जल बरसे और अक्षयतृतीया को गर्जना न होवे तो अनावृष्टि होती है।

 ५९५–माघ में गरमी पड़े, ज्येष्ठ में शीत पड़े और श्रावण में ठंढी वायु चले तो भी अनावृष्टि होती है।

 ५९६–माघ में ठंढ न पड़े, ज्येष्ठ में मूलनक्षत्र पर बादल हों या आर्द्रा में जल न बरसे तो दुष्काल समझना चाहिये।

 ५९७–चैत्र में बिजली न चमके, वैशाख के प्रारंभ में जल बरसे और ज्येष्ठ अधिक तपे तो अत्यन्त सुवृष्टि होती है।

 ५९८–चैत्र में ठंढ के कारण शरीर काँपने लगे, वैशाख में ओले की झड़ी लगे और ज्येष्ठ में आकाश निर्मल रहे तो समझना चाहिये कि वर्षा अच्छी होगी।

 ५९९–पौष में गरमी हो और वैशाख में ठंढ हो तो आषाढ़ में कुछ वृष्टि होजाती है, श्रावण और भाद्रपद में नहीं होती।

 ६००–चैत्र शुक्ला प्रतिपदा को रेवती नक्षत्र के होने पर जल अधिक बरसता है, वैशाख शुक्ल प्रतिपदा को भरणी नक्षत्र के होने पर तृण की विशेष उत्पत्ति होती है।

 ६०१–ज्येष्ठ शुक्ला प्रतिपदा को मृगशीर्ष नक्षत्र में वायु का चलना शुभ है। आषाढ़ शुक्ला प्रतिपदा को आर्द्रा नक्षत्र के होने से धान्य की उत्पत्ति होती है।

 ६०२–अक्षय तृतीया (वैशाख शुक्ला तृतीया) को रोहिणी, ज्येष्ठ की पूर्णिमा को मूल और विजयादशमी (आश्विन शुक्ला दशमी) को श्रवण नक्षत्र के होने से सुभिक्ष होता है, अन्यथा हानि होती है।

 ६०३–ज्येष्ठ के महीने पूर्णिमा में मूलनक्षत्र के गल (बरस) जाने से, श्रावण कृष्णा चतुर्दशी को पूर्वाषाढ़ नक्षत्र में गर्जना न होने से, और आषाढ़ की पूर्णिमा में पूरे ६० घड़ी मूल नक्षत्र के होने से संसार को अवृष्टि के कारण कष्ट होता है।

 ६०४–श्रावण की पूर्णिमा को श्रवण नक्षत्र के न होने से, कार्त्तिक की पूर्णिमा को कृत्तिका नक्षत्र के न होने से, पौष की अमावास्या को मूलनक्षत्र के न होने से और वैशाख की तृतीया को रोहिणी नक्षत्र के न होने से अशुभ समय समझा जाता है।

 ६०५–माघ शुक्ला सप्तमी, फाल्गुन शुक्ला पंचमी, चैत्र शुक्ला तृतीया और वैशाख शुक्ला प्रतिपदा इन तिथियों में रेवती वा अश्विनी नक्षत्र के होने पर गर्भ लक्षण दिखाई देने से शुभ समय समझा जाता है।

 ६०६–इन तिथियों में यदि शुभप्रद वायु (पूर्व, ऐशान्य और उत्तर के) बहुधा चलें तो वर्षाकाल में वर्षा होती है, अन्यथा विपरीत फल होता है।

 ६०७–कार्तिक शुक्ला द्वादशी, मार्गशीर्ष शुक्ला दशमी, पौष शुक्ला पञ्चमी और माघ शुक्ला सप्तमी में रेवती वा अश्विनी नक्षत्र के होते हुए बादल होना स्वाभाविक है, यदि बादल न हो तो अनिष्ट समझना चाहिये।

 ६०८–इन तिथियों में हवा, बादल, गर्जना, बिजली अथवा वृष्टि होजावे तो आषाढ़ से आश्विन तक के महीनों में उक्त चिह्नों के अनुसार तिथि क्रम से अवश्य ही वर्षा होवे।

 ६०९–दीपमालिका को सायंकाल प्रचण्ड वायु का चलना, होलिका को सायंकाल दक्षिण की हवा बहना, और आषाढ़ की पूर्णिमा को सायंकाल नैऋत्य कोण की वायु का चलना महान् दुर्भिक्ष करने वाला होता है।

 ६१०–चैत्र, वैशाख और फाल्गुन के शुक्लपक्ष की त्रयोदशियों में धुन्ध छाजावे तो वर्षा का अभाव समझना चाहिये।

 ६११–आश्विन कार्तिक, माघ चैत्र, ज्येष्ठ, फाल्गुन और श्रावण इन सातों मासों की पूर्णिमा यदि बादल के बिना हो तो शुभ फल देने वाली समझनी चाहिये।

 ६१२–पौष, भाद्रपद, वैशाख, मार्गशीर्ष और आषाढ़ की पूर्णिमाओं में धुन्ध, मेघ, बिजली और शुभ पवन चले तो शुभ फल समझना चाहिये।

 नक्षत्रों के साथ सूर्य का अथवा सूर्य के साथ नक्षत्रों का सम्बन्ध होने से जिन जिन महीनों में वृष्टि के विषय की जो परीक्षा किई जाती है, वह इस प्रकरण में लिखी जाती है।

 ६१३–मघा नक्षत्र में सूर्य के प्रवेश होने के दिवस को छोडकर अन्य नक्षत्रों में सूर्य के प्रवेश होने पर वर्षा होवे तो मनुष्यों को आनन्द प्राप्त होता है और किसानों का हल चलाना फलदायक होता है।

 ६१४–आर्द्रा में भी सूर्य के प्रवेशकाल में वर्षा होना शुभ नहीं है। इससे डेढ़ महीने तक वृष्टि नहीं होती और इसके पश्चात् ही होती है।

 ६१५–सूर्य का आर्द्रानक्षत्र पर नवमी, अष्टमी, चतुर्थी, तृतीया, चतुर्दशी और अमावास्या में आना शुभ नहीं है।

 ६१६–भरणी, कृत्तिका, श्रार्द्रा, मघा, ज्येष्ठा, मूल और पूर्वाषाढ़ नक्षत्रों के दिन में आर्द्रा में सूर्य का प्रवेश करना शुभ नहीं है, शेष नक्षत्रों के दिन प्रवेश करना शुभ है।

 ६१७–दिन के आखिरी प्रहर से प्रारंभ करके रात्रि की तीन प्रहरों में सूर्य का आर्द्रानक्षत्र में प्रवेश करना शुभ है, अन्य समयों में शुभ नहीं।

 ६१८–किसी का मत है कि सूर्य का आर्द्रा में प्रवेश करना दिन में शुभ नहीं है, रात्रि में शुभ है। तथा शनि, मंगल और रविवार के अतिरिक्त अन्य वारों में प्रवेश करना शुभ होता है।

 ६१९–सूर्य के आर्द्रा प्रवेश के दिन वर्षा होने से डेढ़ मास के पश्चात् वृष्टि होती है और वर्षा होते हुए यदि आर्द्रा पर सूर्य आवे तो जल और अन्न का नाश होता है।

 ६२०–हस्त में सूर्य के प्रवेश होने पर वर्षा होने से छः इतियों का सब कष्ट दूर होता है और स्वाती की वृष्टि से समुद्र में मोती विशेष पैदा होते हैं।

 ६२१–कृत्तिका के सूर्य में यदि वर्षा न होवे तो रेवती के सूर्य में जल नाश, अश्विनी के सूर्य में धान्य नाश और भरणी के सूर्य में सर्वनाश का भय है।

 ६२२–वैशाख में कृत्तिका के सूर्य में यदि पाँच छः जल की बूंदें भी गिर जावें तो आगे पीछे के दोषों का नाश होकर शान्ति पैदा करती है।

 ६२३–कृत्तिका के सूर्य में अतिवृष्टि होने से वर्ष मध्यम (साधारण) समझा आता है अथवा दुर्भिक्ष होजाता है।

 ६२४–अथवा कृत्तिका के सूर्य में विन्दुमात्र जल न गिरे तो भी वह वर्ष मध्यम ही होता है, अथवा वर्षा ही नहीं होती।

 ६२५-६२६–कृत्तिका के सूर्य में कुछ वृष्टि होना, रोहिणी के सूर्य में प्रचण्ड धूप पड़ना मृगशीर्ष के सूर्य के शुरू में हवा का बन्द होना और अन्त में हवा का चलना, आर्द्रा के सूर्य में जल की बूंदें गिरना और मन्द पवन का बहना और पुनर्वसु नक्षत्र के सूर्य में फिर पवन का बन्द होजाना ये सुवृष्टि के चिह्न हैं।

 ६२७–कृत्तिका और आर्द्रा के सूर्य में जल की बूंदें न गिरें, रोहिणी के सूर्य में धूप की गरमी न हो और मृगशीर्ष के सूर्य में वायु न चले तो उस देश में प्रबल दुर्भिक्ष होता है।

 ६२८-६२९–इसी प्रकार यदि रोहिणी के सूर्य में तो वायु चले अथवा जल बरस जावे, मृगशीर्ष के सूर्य में भी धूप की गरमी हो, आर्द्रा के सूर्य में हवा चले, कृत्तिका के सूर्य में भी धूप की गरमी हो और रोहिणी के सूर्य में गर्जना होजावे तो इन कारणों से उन उन देशों में प्रबल दुर्भिक्ष होता है।

 ६३०–यदि रोहिणी के सूर्य में वायु, बिजली, बादल और गर्जना इनमें से कोई भी न हुए होतो आर्द्रा में तथा आगे के नक्षत्रों में अच्छी वर्षा होती है।

 ६३१–रोहिणी के सूर्य में रोहिणी के चारों चरणों तक अर्थात संपूर्ण रोहिणी के सूर्य में यदि सूर्य की प्रचण्ड किरणें अर्थात् तेज धूप पड़े तो चारों (चातुर्मास्य के) महीनों में अच्छी वर्षा होगी।

 ६३२–रोहिणी के सूर्य में वृष्टि होजावे अथवा बूंदमात्र भी होजावे तो आगे वृष्टि रुक जाती है।

 ६३३–रोहिणी के सूर्य में यदि बिजली के द्वारा बादल तपादियें जावें अर्थात् बिजली और बादल होजायें तो अश्लेषा के सूर्य के बीत जाने पर बादल आकर वर्षा करते हैं। इसके पूर्व नहीं।

 ६३४–रोहिणी के सूर्य में वर्षा होने से आकाश बादल रहित होजाता है। ७२ दिन तक वर्षा नहीं होती।

 ६३५–किसी का कहना है कि रोहिणी के सूर्य में वृष्टि होना ही नहीं, बूंद गिरना भी अशुभ है। परन्तु नदी चला देने वाली यदि वर्षा होजावे तो वह अशुभ नहीं होती है।

 ६३६–रोहिणी के सूर्य में कई दिन तक बिजली और वर्षा होती रहै तो ७२ दिन के अन्दर भी वर्षा होगी और उसकी रोक नहीं होगी।

 ६३७–सूर्य यदि रीहिणी के प्रथम चरण में वृष्टि करे तो ७२ दिन तक जल का नाश और दूसरे, तीसरे चरण में वृष्टि करे तो घास का नाश होता है । यदि चतुर्थ चरण में वर्षा हो तो समुद्र पर वर्षा चली जाती है, अन्यत्र बादल भी नहीं रहते।

 ६३८–रोहिणी नक्षत्र के ऊपर जब तक सूर्य रहता है उन सूर्य भोग्य के तेरह दिनों में जहाँ जहाँ वृष्टि होती है, वहाँ वहाँ वर्षा की रुकावट समझनी चाहिये।

 ६३९–रोहिणी नक्षत्र पर जब तक सूर्य रहता है उन सूर्य भोग्य के तेरह दिनों में से प्रथम दिन वर्षा होने से ७२ दिन का, दूसरे दिन की वर्षा से ५० दिन तक का, तीसरे दिन की से ४९ दिन का, चौथे दिन की से ४२ दिन का, पाँचवे दिन की वर्षा से ३९ दिन की वर्षों का, छठे दिन की से ३४ दिन का, सातवें दिन की से ३१ दिन का, आठवें दिन की वर्षा से ३० दिन का, नवें दिन की वर्षा से २८ दिन का, दशवें दिन की वर्षा से २४ दिन की वर्षा का, ग्यारहवें दिन की वर्षा से २१ दिन का, बारहवें दिन की से १६ दिन की वर्षा का और तेरहवें दिन की वर्षा से १२ दिन तक को वर्षा का अवरोध (रुकावट) होता है।

 ६४०–कृत्तिका के सूर्य के तपने से, रोहिणी के सूर्य के गर्जने से, मृगशीर्ष के सूर्य केआखिरी चरण में वायु के न चलने से और आर्द्रा के सूर्य में हवा चलने से घास का नाश होता है।

 ६४१–मृगशीर्ष के सूर्य के आखिरी चरण में वायु न चले और रोहिणी के सूर्य में वर्षा हो तो न बिजली और न कभी मेघ गर्जना की आशा रखनी चाहिये इस तरह ज्योतिषी कहते हैं।

 ६४२–मृगशीर्ष पर जब सूर्य रहै तब उस नक्षत्र के प्रथम चरण में वायु न चले तो श्रावण में जब वह नक्षत्र आवे तब दश दिन तक गर्जना और वर्षा होती है।

 ६४३–इसी प्रकार यदि मृगशीर्ष के आखिरी चरण में वायु न चले और धाम रहे तो श्रावण मास में १६ दिन तक वर्षा नहीं होगी।

 ६४४–कोई कहता है कि मृगशीर्ष के सूर्य में चाहे धाम पड़े, रोहिणी के सूर्य में चाहे हवा चले, किन्तु यदि आर्द्रा में वृष्टि हो जावे तो सब आनन्द होता है।

 ६४५–अश्लेषा नक्षत्र पर सूर्य के आने से यदि वर्षा न हो तो मघा, पूर्वाफाल्गुनी, उत्तराफाल्गुनी, हस्त और चित्रा इन पाँचों नक्षत्रों में पर्याप्त वर्षा होती है।

 ६४६–इस तरह नक्षत्र, वार, तिथि और संक्रान्ति के सहित बारह महीनों के गर्भध्रुवक जो कि वर्षा के पूरक हैं, इस द्वादशमासिक नामक दूसरी अध्याय में कहे गये हैं।

![](../books_images/U-IMG-1729347032Screenshot2024-10-19194023.png)**

 गत अध्याय में बारह महींनो की और गर्भ के लक्षण आदि की भी परीक्षा लिखी गई है, गर्भ के और महीनों के अच्छे शकुन आदि होते हुए भी किस कारण से वर्षा नहीं होती यह इस अध्याय में बताया जाता है।

     १     २         ३      ४      ५

 १–गर्भरूप, वैकारिक, सूर्य की किरणें, उल्का और प्रकीर्णक ये पाँच विकार आकाश में स्वभाव हो से होते रहते हैं।

 २–वायु आदि, गन्धर्वनगर आदि, सन्ध्या आदि, वज्र आदि और ग्रहण आदि विकार आकाश में जल के दोष से सूर्य की किरणों में विकार होने के कारण पैदा होते हैं।

 ३–इन विकारों के भेद और इनके नाम, रूप, कर्म ये सब यहाँ कहे जाते हैं। जिनके द्वारा प्रति वर्ष वर्षा के भेद होजाया करते हैं।

**१—गर्भरूपाधिकारः।**

 ४–वायु, बादल, बिजली ऊपर कहे हुए पाँच विकारों में पहला गर्भरूप नामक विकार का वर्णन किया जाता है।

 ५–वायु, बादल, बिजलो, गर्जना और वृष्टि ये पाँच गर्भ के रूप हैं । इन्हीं के महावात,झञ्झावात आदि भेद पृथक और हैं।

**वायुः (सामान्यवात)**

 गर्भ के पाँचों रूपों का वर्णन करते हुए ग्रंथकार पहले वायु का वर्णन लिखते हैं—

 सामान्य तरीके से पूर्व की हवा बादल और वर्षा लाती है, पश्चिम की वर्षा नष्ट करती है, उत्तर की वर्षा पैदा करती है और दक्षिण की हवा केवल हवा ही चलाती है वृष्टि नहीं करती।

 ६-७–हवा तीन तरह की होती है भावक, स्थापक और ज्ञापक। इन में पहिली हवा से बादल आदि पैदा होते हैं, दूसरी हवा से आकाश में बादल स्थित रहते हैं, तीसरी ज्ञापक नामक वायु से आगे आने वाली वृष्टि का पहले ही से ज्ञान होजाता है। इनमें पहला भावक नामक पवन तत्काल या कालान्तर में भी वृष्टि कर दिया करता है।

 ८–सूर्य, सोम और मंगल आदि ग्रहों की ज्योतियों और नक्षत्रों के साथ मेल होने पर गर्भ और प्रसवकाल में उत्पादक नामक पवन होता है।

 ९–आर्त्तव अर्थात् ऋतु संबन्धी जो नियत वायु है वह स्थापक कहलाती है, यह आकाश में गर्भ की स्थापना करती है, किन्तु कभी कभी समुद्र से उठे हुए जल के दोष से नहीं भी स्थित होती है।

 १०–मासिक गर्भ के धारण काल संबन्धी जो वायु है वही ज्ञापक कहलाती है। इस तरह ये तीन प्रकार की वायु कही गई है।

**भावक या उत्पादक।**

 ११–प्रचण्ड वायु से ओले, बर्फ वा जल की वर्षा ४०० कोस के अन्दर होती है।

 १२–पूर्व, दक्षिण, पश्चिम और उत्तर की प्रचण्ड हवा से क्रमशः दक्षिण, पश्चिम, उत्तर और पूर्व दिशा में वर्षा होती है।

 १३–पूर्व अथवा उत्तर की हवा से शीघ्र ही वृष्टि आती है। दक्षिण की वायु से वृष्टि आने में विलम्ब होता है।

 १४–अग्निकोण की वायु से युद्ध, अग्निभय और वृष्टि का नाश होता है। नैऋत्यकोण की वायु जब तक रहै तब तक बड़ी धूप पड़ती है।

 १५–वायव्यकोण की वायु से हवा के साथ वर्षा आती है और मच्छर डाँस आदि छोटे जीव पैदा होते हैं।

 १६–ईशानकोण की वायु से संसार के कल्याण के लिये अच्छी वृष्टि होती है और चारों ओर आनन्द की वृद्धि होती है। इस प्रकार यह वायुचक्र का फल कहा गया है।

 १७–अग्निकोण की हवा कभी अच्छी नहीं है, ईशानकोण की हवा सदा शुभ है और नैऋत्यकोण की हवा रोग, दुर्भिक्ष, युद्ध और भय की उत्पत्ति करती है।

 १८–नैऋत्य, आग्नेय और दक्षिण की हवा गर्जना और बिजली वाले बड़े बड़े मेघों को भी अवश्य उड़ा लेजाती है।

 १९-२०–जिस दिन उत्तर की हवा को रोककर पूर्व की हवा चले उस दिन से आगे पाँच दिन तक वृष्टि होती है। पूर्व दिशा की दवा को रोककर दक्षिण दिशा की हवा चले तो तीन दिन तक वृष्टि होती रहती है। पश्चिम की हवा को रोककर नैऋत्यकोण की यदि हवा चले तो इससे वायु अधिक चलती है और वर्षा कम होती है।

 २१–यदि ठहर ठहर कर सभी दिशाओं से वायु चले तो कभी कभी अत्यन्त अल्पवृष्टि की आशा रखनी चाहिये।

 २२–यदि सूर्य चन्द्रमा के कुण्डलना न हो, इन्द्रधनुष न हो और सर्व दिशाओं की वायु चले तो वह वायु दूर देशों में उठी हुई मेघ घटा को भी वहाँ ले आवेगी।

**स्थापक वायु।**

 २३–स्थापक वायु ऋतुसंबन्धी हवा को कहते हैं। हेमन्तऋतु में दक्षिण की, शिशिर में नैऋत्यकोण की, वसन्त और शरत्ऋऋतु में पश्चिम की हवा श्रेष्ठ होती है।

 २४–शरत्काल में पूर्व की वायु से और बसन्त में उत्तर की वायु से फल पुष्प नष्ट होते हैं और वे पुष्ट नहीं होते ।

 २५–पश्चिमी वायु से आषाढ़ और आश्विन में उत्तर की वायु से श्रावण में और पूर्व की वायु से भाद्रपद में अवश्य वर्षा होती है।

 २६–आषाढ़ में यदि वायव्यकोण की हवा हो, कभी उत्तर की भी होजावे, पुनः श्रावण में ईशानकोण की हवा होजावे तो भाद्रपद में वर्षा नहीं होगी ।

 २७–आषाढ़ में वायव्यकोण की हवा हो, श्रावण में पूर्व की और भाद्रपद में पश्चिम की हवा हो तो अन्न की महँगाई होजावेगी।

 २८–आषाढ़ में दक्षिण की हवा, श्रावण में पूर्व की और भाद्रपद में उत्तर की हवा हो तो वर्षा नहीं होगी।

 २९–आषाढ़ में नैऋत्य की हवा, श्रावण में दक्षिण की और आश्विन में यदि अग्निकोण की हवा चले तो खेतों में धान्य सूख जाता है।

 ३०–इसी तरह यदि श्रावण में नैऋत्य की हवा हो, भाद्रपद में दक्षिण की और आश्विन में पूर्व की बायु हो तो खेतों में अन्न सूख जाता है पैदावार नहीं होती।

 ३१–श्रावण में अग्निकोण की हवा और भाद्रपद में नैऋत्यकोण की हवा चले तो वर्षा नहीं होती, यदि होती है तो बिजली तथा गर्जना रहित होती है।

 ३२–श्रावण में अग्निकोण की हवा चले और भाद्रपद में नैऋत्यकोण की हवा चले तो बिजली और गर्जना से रहित मेघ पृथ्वी पर झूम करके वर्षा करते हैं।

 ३३–इसी प्रकार यदि श्रावण में पश्चिम की हवा, भाद्रपद में नैऋत्य की और आश्विन में पूर्व की हवा चले तो वर्षा न हो यदि हो तो बिजली और गर्जना से रहित हो।

 ३४–भाद्रपद में पश्चिम की हवा चलने से वर्षा नहीं होती, यदि होती है तो कई दिनों तक घटाटोप होकर होती है।

 ३५–भाद्रपद में सब दिशा और विदिशा (कोण) से हवा चले तो घटाटोप के सहित भी मेघ का नाश होजाता है।

 ३६–श्रावण में वायुकोण की, भाद्रपद में पूर्व की और आश्विन में पश्चिम की हवा चलने से कार्त्तिक में धान्य अच्छा पैदा होता है।

**मेघ।**

 गर्भरूप के पाँचों भेदों में से मेघ (बादल) नाम का यह दूसरा भेद है।

 ३७-३८–धाराधर, जलधर, वारिवाह, बलाहक, अम्बुभृत्, वारिद, मेघ, जीमूत, घन, जलमुक्, जलद, नभ्राट्, अब्द, नदनु, अम्बुद, धूमयोनि, पयोगर्भ, तडित्वान्, स्तनयिन ये सब मेघ के ही नामान्तर हैं।

 ३९–धूम, आग, वायु और इनके संघात (मेल) को ही मेघ कहते हैं। इस मेघ की स्थिति (हालत) चार तरह की होती है अभ्र, बादल, घन और घटा।

 ४०–इनमें आकाश के अन्दर फैलने वाला अभ्र कहलाता है। घन के टुकड़ों को बादल कहते हैं, फैले हुए खण्ड घन होते हैं, और खण्ड खण्ड न हों और एक ही रूप में फैले हुए हों तो उन्हें घटा के नाम से पुकारते हैं।

 ४१–मेघ चार तरह के होते हैं—नाग, पर्वत, वृषभ और अर्बुद। इन चारों का जल ही एक कारण है।

 ४२–शीतऋतु में दिग्गज जाति के मेघों से हिम की वर्षा होती है। पुष्कर, आवत्त, संवर्त्त और द्रोण ये मेघ की जातियाँ हैं।

 ४३–दुःख से जल देने वाला मेघ पुष्कर जाति का, निर्जल मेघ आवर्त्त जाति का, अधिक जल वाला संवर्त जाति का और धान्य के योग्य बरसने वाला मेघ द्रोण जाति का होता है।

 ४४–अग्नि, ब्रह्म और पक्ष ये तीन मेघ की योनि (उत्पत्ति कारण) हैं । इन की भी वृद्धि का साधारण हेतु धूम है।

 ४५–अग्नि, ऊष्मा, स्विन्न (गीले पदार्थ) और गर्भ से उत्पन्न हुए मेघों का धूम से आरंभ होता है। इन मेघों में श्रेष्ठ मेघ दुर्दिन की हवा से उत्पन्न हुए होते हैं।

 ४६–हाथी, भैंसे और सुअर की समानता वाले पृथिवी पर आये हुए मेघ वन में और पर्वत शिखरों पर वर्षा करते हैं।

 ४७–थोड़ी वर्षा करने वाले बड़े शरीर वाले, पृथिवी के समीप आये हुए मेघ एक वा आधे कोस के अन्दर पास ही में बरसते हैं।

 ४८–आकाश, नक्षत्र और ग्रहों के योग से जिनकी उत्पत्ति है वे मेघ ब्रह्मज कहलाते हैं, अग्नि से पैदा होने के कारण ऊपर आकाश में गए हुए होते हैं।

 ४९–जो धारासार अर्थात् मोटी बूंदों वाले मेघ हैं वे बहुत दूर तक वर्षा करते हैं। ब्रह्मज मेघों के प्रसङ्ग से अग्नि से उत्पन्न हुए भी मेघ बरस जाया करते हैं।

 ५०–पक्षवाले पर्वतों के पक्ष कटने से जो मेघ बनते हैं, वे पक्षज कहलाते हैं। वे मेघ अनेक प्रकार की आकृति वाले और घोर अवाज़ वाले होते हैं।

 ५१–युगान्त में पृथिवी को जल से पूरित करने वाले और कल्पान्त वृष्टि से पैदा करने वाले मेघ संवर्ताग्नि से बने होते हैं।

 ५२–अधिक पवन चलना या सर्वथा ही पवन का बन्द होना, अधिक गरमी पड़ना या अधिक ठण्ढ का ही गिरना, अधिक बादलों का होना अथवा सर्वथा ही बादलों का न होना ये छः चिह्न मेघ के होते हैं, अर्थात् मेघ के आने से ये लक्षण हुआ करते हैं।

 ५३–आषाढ़ी रोहिणी और आषाढ़ी एवं बारह मास की स्वाती के योग में मेघ की विशेषतायें पहिले कही गई हैं। उससे अधिक यहाँ कुछ और भी कहते हैं।

 ५४–आठ दिशाओं में से सूर्य से छोड़ी हुई, सूर्य से आक्रमण किई हुई और सूर्य से आक्रमण की जाने वाली ये तीन दिशाएँ दीप्तदिक् अर्थात् सूर्य से प्रकाशित अथवा सूर्य वाली कहलाती हैं शेष पाँच दिशाएँ शान्त कहलाती हैं।

 ५५–शान्त दिशा में श्याम, रक्त अथवा पीले रंग का स्निग्ध और मन्दगति का मेघ दिखाई दे तो जल का आगमन जानना चाहिए।

 ५६–शान्त दिशा में जो मेघ शुक्लवर्ण का दृष्टिगत हो तो स्निग्ध और मन्दगति होने पर भी उस मेघ को बरसा हुआ (खाली ) समझना चाहिये।

 ५७–स्निग्ध वर्ण (सुन्दर रंग) और स्निग्ध आवाज के तथा मन्दगति और अच्छे मुहूर्त में उठे हुए मेघ सदा सर्वत्र जल बरसाने वाले होते हैं।

 ५८–अच्छी बिजली, गन्ध, स्वर, वेष, वायु और बूंदों वाले मेघ सुभिक्ष करने वाले होते हैं।

 ५९–रूखे मेघ वायु पैदा करते हैं, खराब गन्ध वाले व्याधि पैदा करते हैं और खराब आवाज तथा वर्ण वाले मेघ बरसते नहीं हैं।

 ६०–केसर के जल समान, नीला और काले रंग का मेघ दक्षिणा से अमिको को जाता हुआ वहाँ ही बरस जाता है।

 ६१–लाल, पीला अथवा नीला मेघ उत्तर को जाता हुआ शीघ्र ही चौतरफी हवा चलकर बरस जाता है।

 ६२–दक्षिण से उत्तर को जावे और उत्तर से दक्षिण को आवे तो वह मेघ बरसता नहीं अथवा बरसे तो कई दिन तक बरसता है।

 ६३–पश्चिम से जब मेघ वायव्य, नैऋत्य आदि कोणों की तरफ जाते हैं तब वे कम जल के होजाते हैं, उनसे वृष्टि नहीं होती है।

 ६४–पश्चिम से जब मेघ आकुल होते हुए आते हैं तब वे वायु पैदा करते हैं और फिर जल वृष्टि करते हैं।

 ६५–पश्चिम से पूर्व को और पूर्व से पश्चिम को जब मेघ जाते हैं तब वे आपस में भिड़े हुए दस दिन तक वर्षा करते हैं ।

 ६६–प्रशान्त (अत्यन्त मन्द) मौसमी (monsoon) वायु की दिशा से सफेद बादलों के पर्वत उदास (प्रचण्ड) मौसमी वायु वाली दिशा में धीरे से चले जाते हैं।

 ६७–प्रचण्ड मौसमी वायु वाली दिशा से प्रशान्त मौसमी वायु वाली दिशा में रूई के ढेर के सदृश जो श्वेत बादल हैं वे चले जाते हैं।

 ६८–रूई के ढेर के समान सफ़ेद बादल वायव्य वा उत्तर से वेग से आते हों तो वे आठों प्रहर अवश्य वर्षा करेगें ।

 ६९–रूई के ढेर के समान श्वेत बादल दक्षिण वा नैऋत्य से आते हों तो वे शीतकाल में वर्षा के अन्दर ओले गिराते हैं।

 ७०–तमाल, अञ्जन और नीलकमल की सी प्रभावाले, मोती और चाँदी की सी आभा वाले और गर्भ में जलचरों की आकृति वाले मेघ अधिक जल बरसाने वाले होते हैं।

 ७१–जो मेघ गन्धर्वपुर के आकार के, वृक्ष के आकार के और जन्तुओं के आकार के होते हैं उन्हीं के खपुर- अभ्रवृक्ष-परिघ आदि विकार होते हैं।

**विद्युत्।**

 गर्भरूप के पाँचों भेदों में से यह विद्युत् तीसरा भेद है।

 ७२-७३–विद्युत्, क्षणप्रभा, मेघप्रभा, वीपा, अचिरप्रभा, ह्रादिनी, ऐरावती, चम्पा, शंपा, सौदामिनी, तडित्, आकालिकी, शतावर्ता, जलदा, जलपालिका, क्षणांश, क्षणिका, राधा, चटुला, चिलमीलिका, सर्ज श्रचिररोचि, चपला, चंचला, चला, शतह्रदा, अशनि नीलांजना और अस्थिरा ये नाम बिजली के हैं।

 ७५–पूर्व की बिजली से जल की वर्षा, आग्निकोण की से जल का नाश, दक्षिण की से कम जल और नैऋत्य की बिजली से डमर[^16] अर्थात् धुंध छाजाती है।

[^16]: "कई विद्वान् डमर का अर्थ महामारी भी करते हैं।"

 ७६–पश्चिम से उठी हुई बिजली अधिक जल और धान्य देने वाली होती है, वायव्यकोणकीबिजली वायु पैदा करती है और उत्तर की बिजली से मेघ आता है।

 ७७–ईशानकोण की बिजली से शीघ्र ही मेघ आता है। इस प्रकार सब दिशाओं की बिजली की परीक्षा जाननी चाहिये। जिस देश में सुभिक्ष होता है बिजली उधर ही जाती हैं।

 ७८–उत्तर दिशा में सुनहरी रंग की बिजली चमके तो उसे अवश्य ही वर्षा करने वाली समझनी चाहिये। शीघ्र ही मेघ का उदय होगा।

 ७९–स्निग्ध बादलों में होने वाली स्निग्ध बिजली जल बरसाने वाली होती है। कृष्णमार्ग (दक्षिणमार्ग) में होने वाली बिजली वायु और वर्षा करती है।

 ८०–स्निग्ध विद्युत् किरणों वाली होती है, हरित विद्युत् हरे रंग की कान्ति वाली होती है, दक्षिण विद्युत दाहिने चक्करों वाली होती है। इन विद्युतों से खूब जल बरसता है।

 ८१–जो विद्युत् अपनी किरणों से भूमि को प्रकाशित करती हुई पश्चिम से दक्षिण दिशा को जाती है, हरिताल के रंग की हो और अधिक रोम वाली हो तो उसे अधिक जल देने वाली समझनी चाहिये।

 ८२–जो विद्युत् पश्चिम से उत्तर को जाती हो, काले बादलों में संस्थित अर्थात् चमक रही हो और स्निग्ध हो तो वह भी वर्षा करने वाली होती है।

 ८३–सफेद रंग वाली ईशानकोण की विद्युत् दक्षिण दिशा में यदि दौड़े, टेढ़ी और ऊर्ध्वगति की हो तो वह भी वर्षा करती है।

 ८४–जो बिजली नीचे और ऊपर विचरने वाली होती है, स्निग्ध और रश्मि वाली होती है वह शब्द करे या न करे सर्वत्र वर्षा करती है।

 ८५–जो विद्युत् मेघ के अन्दर नील, ताम्र या सफेद रंग की चमकती हो वह चाहे धीमी वा तेज आवाज वाली हो खूब जल बरसाती है।

 ८६–किसी का मत है कि-कपिल रंग की विद्युत् हवा के लिये, लाल रंग की धूप के लिये, पीली वृष्टि के लिये और दुर्भिक्ष डालने के लिये काले रंग की बिजली चमकती है।

 ८७-८८–श्याम और ताँबे के रंग की विद्युत हेमन्त ऋतु में, लाल और पीली शिशिर में, नीले और पीले रंग की बसन्त में, हरे और मधु के रंग की ग्रीष्म में, रूखी और स्थिर विद्युत् वर्षाऋतु में तथा गौर और नीलविद्युत शरद काल में निर्जल (जल रहित) होती है।

 ८९–अपने किरणों की समानता वाली लाल विद्युत् लाल बादलों में, हरी विद्युत हरे बादलों में और नीले रंग की विद्युत् नीले बादले में वर्षा करती है ।

 ९०–आगे लिखे हुए महा मेघों से इतर जो छोटे मेघ हैं वे विद्युत् के प्रकाश के बिना न कभी जल बरसाते हैं और न कभी गर्जना करते हैं।

 ९१–मुसल, गजनील दुन्दुभि, क्रम, पार्थिव, पर्जन्य, माधव और धाता ये महा मेघ कहलाते हैं ।

 ९२–ऊपर कहे हुए महा मेघ वर्षा करने के लिये न तो बिजली का अनुरोध करते हैं और न वे अधिक गर्जना ही करते हैं, वे मेघ एक ही बार की वर्षा से संपूर्ण संसार को जल से भर देते हैं।

**गर्जितम्।**

 गर्भरूप का गर्जित (गर्जना) नाम का यह चौथा भेद है।

 ९३–आकाश से पैदा हुआ शब्द तीन कारण से होता है-मेघ से, वज्र से और वायु से। इन शब्दों के गर्जित, स्तनित, मेघनिर्घोष और रसित ये नाम हैं।

 ९४–प्रातः काल के समय की गर्जना सत्यवादी की सत्य होती है। इससे दो प्रहर के अन्दर अवश्य ही वर्षा होगी यो वायु चलेगी।

**वृष्टिः।**

 गर्भरूप का यह अन्तिम पाँचवां भेद है ।

 ९५–कूर्मपुराण के उपरिभाग में, ४२ वीं अध्याय में लिखा है कि सूर्य की किरणों से पिया हुआ जल बादलों में ठहरता है। फिर वह जल समय आने पर भूमि पर पड़ता है और उससे समुद्र भरता हैं I

 ९६–इसी प्रकार ब्रह्माण्डपुराण में भी लिखा है कि तेज (सूर्य) सब भूतों (भौतिक वस्तुओं) से किरणों के द्वारा जल लेलेता है समुद्र (पारमेष्टय सोम समुद्र) के अम्भ नामक जल के योग से किरणें आपू नामक सांसारिक जल को लेजाती है।

 जल की चार अवस्थायें होती हैं-अम्भ, मरीची, मर और आप्। इनमें अम्भ जल परमेष्ठी नामक सूर्य के ऊपर के भाग में वाय्वात्मक रूप से सूर्य की किरणों द्वारा आता रहता है। इसे आजकल 'हाईड्रोजन (Hydrogen) कहते है। आप् नामक जल कहलाता है, जिसे आजकल सब पीने आदि के काम में लेते हैं।

 ९७–अपनी गति के कारण हटा (लौटा) हुआ सूर्य भौतिक वस्तुओं से उठाये हुए उस जल को फिर श्वेत और कृष्ण किरणों द्वारा मेघ में बांधता है।

 ९८–मेघों के अन्दर आया हुआ वह जल वायु (आर्तव Monsoon) से प्रेरित होकर फिर वापिस भूमि पर बरस जाता है । जल जिस प्रकार या जिन कारणों से इधर उधर घूमते हैं इसका कारण बुद्धिमान् वैज्ञानिक ही जानते हैं ।

 ९९–तेज किरणों से तपते हुए और मन्दपवन वाले मेघ वर्षाकाल में क्रुद्ध हुए की तरह बड़ी बड़ी धाराओं से बरसते हैं।

 १००–प्रातःकाल के समय जल की बूँदे गिरे तो चौथे या पाँचवें प्रहर में मेघ बरसता है।

 १०१–सूर्यास्त काल में यदि जल की बूंदें गिरें तो चौथे या पाँचवें दिन में जाकर मेघ बरसता है।

 १०२–जिस देश में खारी, कड़वी, दुर्गन्ध वाली और धान्य नाश करने वाली वर्षा होती है, वह देश खेती के नाश से नष्ट होजाता है।

 १०३–वर्षा के अन्दर मत्स्य और मेढकों के गिरने से सुभिक्ष होता है तथा शंख, शंबूक (जल में पैदा होने वाली सीपें) और कडुआ इनके गिरने से दुर्भिक्ष होता है।

 १०४–जिन्वरावृत् प्रभृति वृष्टि के आठ विशेषक हैं। वेद में पुरोवात आदि से योगविशेषज कहे गये हैं।

 १०५-१०६–धारा सम्पात, आसार, सीकर, अम्बुकण, द्रप्स, स्तोक, पृषविन्दु, पृषत, विप्रुट्इतनी अवस्थाओं में वृष्टि होना बरसना कहलाता है। वृष्टि और वर्षा वृष्टि के नाम हैं। अवग्रह और वग्रह वृष्टि के न होने को कहते हैं। करका और हिमपात भी वृष्टि के ही नाम हैं।

 इस प्रकार गर्भरूप के वायु, मेघ, विद्युत् गर्जित और वृष्टि इन पाँच भेदों का वर्णन यहाँ समाप्त हुआ।

 प्रथम गर्भरूप विकार का वर्णन कर चुके अब दूसरा वैकारिकाधिकार यहाँ से प्रारंभ होता है।

 १०७–जीमूत आदि मेघों के भेद से उत्पन्न हुए खपुर, शाखी (अभ्रतरु) परिघ, निर्घात, करका और हम ये छः वैकारिकभाव हैं क्रमशः इनका वर्णन आगे लिखते हैं ।

**खपुर।**

 १०८–आकाश में किसी पुर के समान अनेक रंग और आकृति वाला तथा पताका, ध्वजा और तोरणों से युक्त जो गन्धर्वनगर दिखाई देता है वह खपुर कहलाता है।

 १०९–यह गन्धर्वनगर अब सुफ़ेद बादल, बिजली और मेघों के सहित स्निग्ध दिखाई दे तो जल का आगमन समझना चाहिये।

 ११०–यदि गन्धर्वनगर कपिल रंग का हो तो धान्य का नाश, मंजीठ के रंग का (लाल) हो तो पशुघात और अव्यक्तवर्णं (अस्पष्ट रंग) का हो तो सेनाओं में बलका क्षोभ करता है, ऐसा विद्वान् लोग कहते हैं।

**अभ्रतरु।**

 १११–आकाश के अन्दर होने वाले वृक्ष के आकार के मेघों के वास्ते शाखी, खशाखी, खतरु और अभ्रतरु आदि शब्दों के प्रयोग होते हैं।

 ११२–आकाश में नीम समुद्र के समान आगे के भाग वाले और सूर्य को ढकने वाले जो शाखी होते हैं, वे यदि मोटी जड़ के घने और पीले हों तो अधिक वृष्टि होती है।

**परिघ।**

 ११३–सूर्य के ऊपर मेघ की तिरछी रेखा को परिघ कहते हैं। वह रेखा चाहे हस्व, दीर्घ, काली या सफेद हो।

 ११४–सूर्योदय समय में उठीहुई परिघ रेखा यदि सुफेद हो तो राजा का अन्त, शोण (लाल) हो तो सेना में हलचल और सुनहरी हो तो बल की वृद्धि करती है।

**निर्घात।**

 ११५–स्फूर्जथु, वज्रनिर्घोष, निर्घात, अनभ्रगर्जित ये गर्जना के नाम हैं। जिस दिशा में अनभ्रगर्जित (बिना बादल के गर्जना) हो उस दिशा का नाश होजाता है।

 ११६–आपस में पवन से पवन आहत होकर आकाश से पृथ्वी पर आती है तब जोर की आवाज होती है, इसी आवाज का नाम निर्घात है।

**करका।**

 ११७-११८–धाराङ्कुर, राधरङ्कु, वर्षोपल, घनोपल, मेघोपल, मेघास्थि, मटची, पुंजिका, बीजोदक, घनकफ, वार्चर और करका ये ओलों के नाम हैं। अधिक ओलों के गिरने से दुर्भिक्ष होता है।

**हिम।**

 ११९–हिम चार तरह की होती है—प्रालेय, तुषा, धूमिका और अवश्याय। इनमें अगला अगला सूक्ष्म समझना चाहिये।

 १२०–जल बरफ के समान कठिन होजाने पर प्रालेय कहलाता है। मेरुप्रान्त में, हिमालय में और ओले आदि में इस प्रालेय का रूप दिखाई देता है।

 १२१–तुषार वह कहलाता है, जो अपने बरस जाने के बाद और भोलों के बरसने के बाद दो तीन दिन तक अत्यन्त कॅपाने वाला तथा वृक्षों का नाश करने वाला होता है।

 १२२–धूमिका वह होती है, जो प्रायः प्रातःकाल में पौष, माघ के महीनों में सूर्य की किरणों को क्षीण (निस्तेज) बना देती है और धूआँ की तरह सब को ढक लेती है।

 १२३-१२४–कुहिढ, कुहेड़ि, कुहेलिका, नभोरेणु कुज्झरिका, कुज्झटि, कुज्झटी, धूममद्दिषो और रतान्ध्री ये धूमिका के नाम हैं। ये धूमिका अत्यन्त घनी भूत बनकर अवश्याय (ओस) के पतन का कारण होता है।

 १२५–हर रोज जल के जो छोटे छोटे कण प्रतिरात्रि में बरसते हैं उन्हें अवश्याय (ओस)कहते हैं।

 १२६–सन्ध्या, कुण्डल, इन्द्रधनुष, दण्ड, त्रिशूल, मत्स्य और अमोघ ये सात विकार सूर्य की किरणों से पैदा होते हैं।

**सन्ध्या।**

 १२७–दिन और रात्रि की सन्धि में दो या तीन नाडीमात्र के समय को सन्ध्या कहते हैं अथवा जब तक ताराओं का दर्शन हो उस काल को सन्ध्या कहते हैं।

 १२८–सन्ध्या के समय में यदि शीतल, मन्द, सुगन्ध पवन चले, आकाश निर्मल हो और दिशाएँ लालकमल की तरह प्रभा वाली हों तो शुभ समझना चाहिये।

 १२९–सब दिशाओं में चमकती हुई यदि सन्ध्या दिखाई देती हो तो महामेघ का उदय समझना चाहिये और वृष्टि होगी।

 १३०– यदि सन्ध्या वैडूर्यकमल और किञ्जल्क (कमल केसर) की प्रभा के सदृश तथा कुवलय (कमल) की सी प्रभा वाली हो और बायु रहित तथा सूर्य प्रकाशित हो तो शीघ्र ही वर्षा करती है।

 १३१–मत्स्य, अमोघ, परीवेष, परिधि और इन्द्रधनुष आदि स्निग्ध सूर्य की किरणों में वृष्टि होती है, रूक्ष और वैकृत से वृष्टि नहीं होती है।

 १३२–प्रातः काल की सन्ध्या मत्स्य वाली और सायंकाल की सन्ध्या अमोघ वाली हो तो यह मेघ का अव्यर्थ योग है, अवश्य ही वृष्टि होगी।

 १३३–सन्ध्या के समय दुष्ट आकृति वाले बादलों से, धूम से, बर्फ से और गन्धर्वपुर के दिखाई देने से अनावृष्टि होती है, असमय में शस्त्र-कोप होता है।

 १३४–शिशिर आदि छः ऋतुओं में अपनी प्रकृति के अनुसार सन्ध्या यदि शोण कुछ लाल), पीत, श्वेत, चित्रविचित्र कमल की आभावाली और खून की सी रंगवाली हो तो शुभ समझना चाहिए।

 १३५–सन्ध्या के समय यदि पूर्व का आकाशमण्डल भैसे, ऊँट, सूअर, बैल, हाथी तथा पर्वताकार वाले मेघों से आच्छादित हों तो पाँच या सात रात्रि में वहाँ वर्षा समझनी चाहिये। ईशानकोण में ऊपर लिखे आकार वाले यदि मेघ हों तो अर्धरात्रि में वर्षा आवेगी। अर्थात् शीघ्र ही वर्षा समझनी चाहिये।

 १३७–सन्ध्या के समय उत्तर दिशा में पर्वतपंक्ति दिखाई देने से वहाँ तीसरे दिन वृष्टि होती है।

 १३८–सन्ध्या के समय वायव्यकोण में उपर्युक्त वैसे ही मेघ दिखाई देने से रातदिन वातवर्षा होती है और पश्चिम में पर्वतमाला दिखाई देने से सात या तीन दिन वर्षा होती है।

 १३९–दक्षिण में सन्ध्याकाल के समय यदि कोटीनार (कॉंगरेदार दिवाले) के समान वैसे ही उपर्युक्त मेघ दृष्टिगत हों तो तीन, पाँच या सात रात वर्षा होती है।

 १४०–सन्ध्याकाल में आग्नेयकोण के अन्दर उपर्युक्त मेघ दिखाई देवें तो उसी रात में निश्चय से वर्षा समझनी चाहिये।

 १४१–सन्ध्या के समय बहुपुट (अधिकतह) वाले मेघ हों तथा वे मोर, चातक, जपा (लाल पुष्य), तोता, जलजन्तु, लहरें और पहाड़ों के समान हों तो उन मेघों से शीघ्र ही वर्षा होजाती है।

 १४२–शान्त (सूर्य से अप्रकाशित) दिशा से उठेहुए वीरण गुल्म की आभा वाले सफ़ेद अथवा सफेद किनारों वाले मेघों के द्वारा दाहिनी ओर से यदि सूर्य का आच्छादन हो तो वृष्टि समझनी चाहिये।

 १४३–दोनों सन्ध्या के समय हाथी, घोड़े पर्वत, छत्र और ध्वजा के समान बादलों का होना शुभ है। पलाल, धूम वाले स्निग्ध बादल बल वृद्धि करते हैं।

 १४४– दोनों सन्ध्या के समय पुर के आकार, वृक्ष के आकार वाले और गहरे लालवणं वाले झुके हुए मेघ शुभ समझे जाते हैं।

**कुण्डल।**

 १४५–कुण्डल दो तरह का होता है परिधि और परिवेष। परिधि भी दो तरह की होती है प्रत्यर्क (सूर्य को लक्ष्य कर) और प्रतिचन्द्र।

**प्रत्यर्क परिधि।**

 १४६–सम, स्निग्ध और ऋतु के अनुकूल वर्ण वाली प्रत्यर्क परिधि शुभ होती है वैदूर्य के सदृश आभावाली स्वच्छ और श्वेत परिधि सुभिक्ष और क्षेम करती है।

 १४७–प्रत्येक परिधि यदि सूर्य के उत्तर में हो तो वृष्टि, दक्षिण में हो तो वायु और दोनों तरफ स्थित हो तो जल का भय करती है।

 १४८–परिधियाँ यदि सूर्य के दोनों तरफ विम्ब से भिड़ी हुई हो तो अधिक वर्षा होती है, चारों ओर स्थित हो तो वर्षा नहीं होती।

**परिवेष।**

 १४९–आकाश के अन्दर सूर्य और चन्द्रमा की जो किरणें वायु से प्रतिमूर्छित (दबाई) हुई सूक्ष्म अभ्र के अन्दर गोलाकार होती है उन्हें परिवेष नाम से कहते हैं।

 १५०–ग्रह और तारों के परिवेषों के फल उन्हीं तारों और ग्रहों के फल के समान समझना चाहिये। किन्तु चातुर्मास्य में परिवेष जल बरसाने वाली ही होती हैं।

 १५१–दिक्पतियों के कारण बादलों की तरह लाल, श्वेत, कबूतरों के रंग के पाण्डु, मेचक (काले), शबल (चित्रविचित्र) तथा संकर (सब मिले हुए) रंग के परिवेष हुआ करते हैं।

 १५२–लाल, नीले, सुफ़ेद, कबूतरी, कपिल रंग वाले पीले और हरे रंग परिवेष पूर्वादि दिशाओं में वर्षा करते हैं। यह नारद ऋषि का मत हैं।

 १५३–शिशिर, वसन्त, ग्रीष्म, वर्षा, शरत् और हेमन्त इन छः ऋतुओं में यदि क्रमशः चाप, मयूर, रजत (चाँदी) तैल, दूध और जल के रंग के समान स्निग्ध परिवेष प्रकट हों वें तो शुभ होते हैं।

 १५४–अपने एक ही वर्ण से युक्त, स्निग्ध, अच्छा फैला हुआ और सुराकार अभ्र से युक्त परिवेष अपनी ऋतु में शीघ्र ही वर्षा करता है।

 १५५–संपूर्ण आकाश में व्याप्त अनेक रंग वाला, लाल प्रभावाला, रूखा, टूटे धनुष वाला और शकट (गाड़े) के समान स्थित हुआ परिवेष पाप का कारण होता है।

 १५६–जो परिवेष बारंबार दिखाई देकर विलीन होजाता है, वह मन्द फल होता है। मयूर के गले की सी आभावाला परिवेष अधिक वर्षा करता है।

 १५७–कपिल, स्निग्ध, दूध, तैल, जल, धनुष, शृङ्गारक और रक्त की सी आभा वाले परिवेष शुभ होते हैं। इस तरह परिवेषों के विषय में नारद का मत है।

 १५८–परिवेष यदि ग्रहनक्षत्र मण्डल के अन्तर्गत हो तो तीन दिन में वर्षा हो जाती है। शनि के मण्डल में होने पर छोटे धान्यों का क्षय और वात वृष्टि होती है।

 १५९–मण्डल में शुक्र के होने से दुर्भिक्ष और बुध के होने से धान्य नाश होता है। यदि मण्डल में ग्रहों का युद्ध होतो अनावृष्टि होती है। और ग्रहयोग से भी हानि होती है।

 १६०–सूर्य चन्द्रमा के कुण्डल होने से पाँच प्रहर में वृष्टि होती है। यदि कुण्डल लाल अत्यन्त पास ही हो तो शीघ्र ही मेघगर्जना होती है।

 १६१–सूर्य चन्द्रमा के यदि दो दो छोटे-बड़े कुण्डल हों तो वहाँ उस देश में अनेक दिन तक बहुवृष्टि होती है।

 १६२–सूर्य चन्द्रमा के दो दो कुएडल यदि पाँच रंग के हों तो तीन दिन तक वहाँ बहुवृष्टि होगी।

 १६३–सूर्य चन्द्रमा के यदि तीन-तीन कुण्डल हों तो भाद्रपद में पूरे महीने तक अच्छी वर्षा होती है।

 १६४–सूर्य चन्द्रमा के यदि नित्य नये-नये कुण्डल होते हों तो खेती को कर्त्तरीकीट, (काट देने वाले कीड़े) अथवा टिडियाँ अवश्य नष्ट कर देगी।

 १६५–चन्द्र के एक कुण्डल और सूर्य के यदि दो मण्डल होवें तो तीसरे दिन वहाँ अधिक वर्षा होगी।

 १६६–चन्द्रमा के श्वेतकुण्डल और सूर्य के लालकुण्डल हो तो वर्षा होती है। इससे यदि विपरीत कुण्डल होवे तो केवल घटाटोप ही हो जाता है, वर्षा नहीं होती।

 १६७–सूर्य के एक वा दो सफेद कुण्डल होवें तो उससे पेडों को उखाड़ने वाली प्रचण्ड हवा चलेगी।

 १६८–सूर्य के पाँच वर्ण वाला विस्तृत कुण्डल होने से खूब बादल छा जाते हैं और खूब वर्षा होती है।

 १६९–देदीप्यमान सूर्य के यदि पीला, विस्तीर्ण, क्षुराभ्रक से व्याप्त और गोलाकार कुण्डल होतो तत्काल वर्षा समझनी चाहिये।

 १७०–रात्रि में चन्द्रमा के कुण्डल होने से प्रातःकाल हवा चलती है। कुण्डल के साथ परिधि होतो वर्षा भी आती है।

 १७१–चन्द्रमा के यदि छोटे बड़े दो कुण्डल धूम वर्ण के हों तो अनावृष्टि होगी, केवल वायुमात्र चलेगी।

 १७२–कुण्डल विस्तीर्ण हो और उसके अन्दर तारे मकते हों तो वायु चलती है, वर्षा नहीं होती है अथवा वर्षा होती है तो कई दिन तक होती रहती है।

 १७३–ऊगते हुए चन्द्रमा को मेघ के रंग वाला, स्निग्ध परिवेष घेर लेवे तो महावृष्टि होती है।

**इन्द्रायुध।**

 १७४–इन्द्रायुध दो प्रकार का होता है–धनुष और ऐरावत-सूर्य की किरणों में स्थित प्राण, जो प्रकाश करता है, वही इन्द्र कहलाता है।

 १७५–पवन से टकराई हुई सूर्य की किरणें जो जल के अन्दर प्रविष्ट होजाती हैं उससे सात वर्ण वाले धनुष की स्थिति होती है। यही इन्द्रधनुष कहलाता है।

 १७६–कुछ कटाहुआ, प्रकाशवाला, स्निग्ध, भूमि पर गाढा (कुछ जोशदार) दूसरी जिसकी परछाई भी हो और जो अनुलोम भी हो वह धनुष अच्छा होता है। इससे जल आता है।

 १७७–पृथ्वी पर गाढ़े रंग के, न टूटे हुये प्रतिकूल दो धनुष यदि कभी भी हों तो वे शुभ नहीं हैं।

 १७८–किसी जल के साथ उठाहुआ धनुष अवृष्टि करता है, भूमि से उठा हुआ धान्य-नाश करता है, साँप की बम्बी से उठा हुआ युद्ध करने वाला और किसी वृक्ष से उठा हुआ धनुष व्याधि पैदा करता है।

 १७९–वर्षा न होते हुए पूर्व में धनुष दीखे तो वृष्टि होती है और यदि वर्षा होते हुए धनुष दीखे तो वृष्टि का नाश होता है। पश्चिम में धनुष होने से सदा वृष्टि होती है।

 १८०–सूर्य के अस्त समय में पश्चिम दिशा के अन्दर इन्द्रधनुष के होने से बारहवें प्रहर में वहाँ पूर्ण वृष्टि होती है।

 १८१–जहाँ प्रातःकाल पश्चिम दिशा के अन्दर इन्द्रधनुष हो और वारुण (जल बरसाने वाले) नक्षत्र हों तो वहाँ शीघ्र ही वर्षा होती है।

 १८२–उत्तर में इन्द्रधनुष के होने से अचानक वर्षा होती है। और दक्षिण में इन्द्रधनुष के होने से वर्षा की रुकावट होती है अथवा कई दिन तक वर्षा होती रहती है।

 १८३–आकाश में आधे इन्द्रधनुष के होने से अत्यन्त शुभ के होने से अत्यन्त शुभ वर्षा और समर्धता होती है।

 १८४–बुध और सूर्य को छोड़कर अन्यवारों में इन्द्रधनुष के होने से चौथे, पाँचवे दिन वर्षा होती है।

 १८५–ऊपर कहा हुआ इन्द्रधनुष टेढ़ा होता है, यही यदि सीधा और लाल हो तो ऐरावत कहलाता है 1 इसका भी फल इन्द्रधनुष के समान ही समझना चाहिये।

**दण्ड, त्रिशूल, मत्स्य, अमोघ।**

 १८६–सूर्य से उठी हुई रेखा अमोघ कहलाती है, वह अग्र भाग से खण्डित हो तो उसी का नाम दण्ड होजाता है और यदि ऐसी तीन रेखायें हों तो उसका नाम त्रिशूल है।

 १८७–भिन्न दिशाओं से उठी हुई दो अमोघ रेखा से मत्स्य होता है। इस प्रकार की विशेषता होने पर भी संकरता से फल कहा जाता है।

 १८८–अमोघ नाम की सूर्य की किरणें यदि श्वेत, स्निग्ध, पूर्ण और आकाश में आदि-मध्य-अन्त तक जाने वाली हों तो वृष्टि होती है।

 १८९–साफ़ आकाश में अमोघ यदि दक्षिण की ओर घूमे हुए लंबे, चमकीले, साफ़ और सरल दिखाई देते हों तो वे श्रेष्ठ होते हैं।

 १९०–जो अमोघ मैले, छोटे, टेढ़े, विकृत, कटे हुऐ, विषम, नष्ट से हुए और बाँई ओर घूमे हुए होते हैं वे वृष्टि बरसाने वाले नहीं होते।

 १९१–अमोष यदि भूरे, नाना वर्ण, कपिल, हरित–रक्त, अथवा विचित्र रंग के हों तो उन्हें कृष्टि करने वाले समझने चाहिये।

 १९२–सन्ध्या के समय बादलों से निकली हुई सूर्य की अमोघ किरणें दृष्टिगत होने से पृथ्वी पर झुक्रे बादलों से बहु वृष्टि का लक्षण समझना चाहिये।

 १९३–उदय और अस्त होते हुए सूर्य की अमोघ रेखा यदि एक हो तो उसी दिन वर्षा आती यदि वे तीन हों तो तीन दिन के पश्चात् वृष्टि होती है।

 १९४–यदि अमोघ रेखा सन्ध्याकाल में उत्तर दिशा के अन्दर अधिक लटकी (निकली) हुई हों तो तीसरे दिन वहाँ वृष्टि होगी।

 १९५–यदि उत्तर दिशा में सन्ध्या के समय अमोघ रेखा अधिक लम्बी (निकली हुई) हो तो शीतकाल में अधिक शांत पड़ेगा और वर्षाकाल में अच्छी वर्षा होगी।

 १९६–पश्चिम से उठी हुई अमोघ रेखा सायंकाल यदि आकाश में खण्डित दिखाई दे तो उस रात्रि के अन्त में अथवा दूसरे दिन अधिक वर्षा होगी।

 १९७–प्रातः काल पूर्व से उठी हुई रेखा यदि पश्चिम में और उत्तर में भी जावे तो दस दिन तक वर्षा होगी अथवा वायु चलेगी।

 १९८–दो, चार अथवा छः यदि मत्स्य हो जावें और इसी प्रकार इतने ही इन्द्रधनुष होजावें तो प्रचण्ड वायु चलेगी।

 १९९–सूर्य किरण, मरुत् और अभ्रों का संघात यदि दण्ड की तरह। एक सीध में) स्थित हो और वह दण्ड दिशाओं में किसी कोण की तरफ हो तो वह दण्ड राजा और ब्राह्मणों को दुःखप्रद होता है।

 २००–यदि यह दण्ड पूर्व और मध्य की सन्धि में हुआ होतो युद्ध की सम्भावना करता है। वह दण्ड यदि श्वेत आदि रंग का होतो अपनी सामने की दिशा में (स्थित) ब्राह्मणादि को मारता है।

 २०१–अन्तरिक्ष में पैदा हुई अग्नियां, वज्र, विद्युत्, महोल्का, धिष्ण्या और तार इन पांच नामों से कही जाती हैं

 वज्र १२ अगुल को तिरछा दण्डाकार होता है। इसी का दूसरा भेद 'महावज्र' है। यह त्रिकोण होता है। इसकी प्रत्येक भुजा हल के फाल के समान होती है और प्रत्येक भुजा के बीच में एक लम्बी कील निकली रहती है। यह ![](../books_images/U-IMG-1729159596r1.png) महावज्र होता है। विद्युत् प्रसिद्ध है। उल्का और धिष्ण्या दोनों में प्रकाश होता है किन्तु उल्का का प्रकाश धीरे २ बढ़ता है और धिष्ण्या में एक दम प्रकाश होकर शनैः शनैः क्षीण होजाता है। तारा टूट ने में प्रकाश नहीं होता, एक सीधी पतली सी रेखा होकर नष्ट हो जाती है।

 २०२–बिजली और तारा छः दिन, उल्का पक्ष मात्र और बज्र तथा धिष्ण्या तीन पक्ष (४५ दिन) से दिखते हों तो ये फलपाक अच्छा करते हैं, सुभिक्ष होगा।

 २०३–वज्र, बिजली और उल्का इनके फल में जितना बल है उससे आधा धिष्ण्या के फल में और धिष्ण्या से आधा तारा के फल में बल समझना चाहिये।

 २०४–वज्र जब गिरता है, तब बड़ी भारी आवाज से भूमि को विदार देता है। यह मकान, वृक्ष और प्राणियों के शरीर पर अधिक गिरता है।

 २०५–२०६–ह्रादिनी, वज्र, आपोत्र, भिदिर, भिदुर, भिदु, जम्भारी, जाम्बवि, दंभ, दंभोलि, अशनि, पवि, शतधार, शतार, गौ, मेघभूति, गिरिज्वर, शतकोटि, स्वरु, शंब, कुलिश और गिरिकण्टक ये वज्र के नाम हैं।

 २०७–ईंधन के समूह पर और जीवों पर तटतट शब्द करती हुई, सभी को त्रास देने वाली, जलती हुई बिजली सहसा गिरजाती है।

 २०८–धिष्ण्या, पतली और छोटी पूंछवाली जलते हुए अंगारे के समान तथा दो हाथ एवं इससे कुछ अधिक भी होती है। यह दश [धनुष]("एक धनुष ८ हाथ लंबा होता है।") तक दिखाई देती है।

 २०९–तारा एक हाथ लंबी, सफ़ेद वा ताम्र, कमल तंतु की तरह होती है। वह चलाये हुए बाण की तरह ऊपर नीचे वा तिरछी जाती है।

 २१०–वज्र चक्र की तरह होता है, बिजली टेढ़ी और बड़ी होती है। आकाश में खैंची हुई रेखा के समान तारा और धिष्ण्या भी वैसी ही होती है।

 २११–काश्यप ऋषि कहते हैं कि–उल्का लंबी शिखावाली, आगे का सूक्ष्म भागवाली, लाल नीली शिखा से उज्वल और पुरुष के प्रमाण की इत्यादि नाना प्रकार की होती है।

 २१२–उल्का गिरती हुई बढ़ती है, इसका शिर स्थूल होता है, पूँछ पतली और लंबी होती है और पुरुष के प्रमाण की होती है। इस तरह अनेक प्रकृति की उल्का होती है।

 २१३–जो उल्का हल, अस्त्र, वानर, मगरमच्छ, ऊँट, दाढ़वाले सूअर आदि प्रेत, गर्दर्भ, गोधा, सर्प और धूमरूप की होती है तथा जो दो मस्तक की होती है वह खराब होती है।

 २१४– जो उल्का हाथी, घोड़ा, पर्वत, चन्द्रमा, कमल, हंस, मछली, ध्वजा, श्रीवत्स और स्वस्तिक आकृति की होती है वह सुभिक्ष आदि शुभ फल देती है।

 २१५–जो उल्का चाँद और सूरज को छूने वाली और जो चाँद और सूरज से निकली हुई होती है वह भूकंप के सहित दुर्भिक्ष, अनावृष्टि आदि अशुभ फल देती है।

![](../books_images/U-IMG-1729927171Screenshot2023-05-17160630.png)संसार भर में चार प्रकार के पदार्थ होते हैं–स्वज्योति, परज्योति, रूपज्योति और अज्योति। जो ज्योति स्वतः अपने आप प्रकाशित होती है जिसे दूसरे प्रकाश की आवश्यकता नहीं होती वह स्वज्योति है। दूसरे की ज्योति से ज्योतिष्मयी बनकर अन्यों को प्रकाशित करने वाली परज्योति होती है। अपने रूपमात्र से प्रकाशित होने वाली रूपज्योति कहलाती है। जो सर्वथा ज्योति रहित है, वह अज्योति होती है। इनमें स्वज्योति को सूर्य कहते हैं, यह सूर्य स्वज्योति होने से ही चारों ओर से सर्वदा प्रकाशित रहता है, अतः इसमें अंधकार का कुछ भी प्रवेश नहीं होसकता है। इन्द्र का रूप प्रकाशही कहा गया है, अतः सूर्य को इन्द्र भी कहा जाता है तथा 'देवानामनीकं ' (देवताओं का स्थान) भी इसी कारण कहते हैं।

 परज्योति को चन्द्रमा कहते हैं, यह सूर्यज्योति से ज्योतिष्मान् बनकर प्रकाश करता है, स्वयं प्रकाश रहित है, इसी से 'कृष्णचन्द्र' भी कहते हैं। ऋग्वेद में लिखा है—“अन्नाह गोरमन्वत नामत्वष्टुरपीच्यम्। अथा चन्द्रमसो दिवि” इत्यादि इन्ही वैदिक मन्त्रों के आधार पर ज्योतिषशास्त्र में भी यह लिखा गया है—

 यह राहु भिन्न भिन्न रूप का दृष्टिगत होता है। वृष्टि के विकार में जो ये फल दिखाता है उसी का आगे निरूपण किया जाता है।

 २१८–ग्रहों की तरह गतिवाले होने के कारण इन राहुओं को उपग्रह कहते हैं। ये राहु चार प्रकार के होते हैं कील, स्वर्भानु, नाग और पात।

 २१९–आकाश में जो पिण्ड अज्योति होकर घूम रहे हैं वे कीलक कहलाते हैं और परज्योति प्रकाशित पिण्ड का छायामय आधा भाग स्वर्भानु कहलाता है।

 २२०–कक्षावृत्त के नाम से ग्रहों के जो गति हैं, वे सर्प की आकृति से बहुधा घूमे हुए नाग कहलाते हैं।

 २२१–इन्हीं नागों का जो परस्पर संघात है वही पात कहलाता है, ये सब चारों प्रभाहीन (अज्योति) होने से राहु कहलाते हैं।

**“तरणि-किरण-सङ्गादेष पानीय पिण्डो,  
दिनकर दिशि चञ्चच्चन्द्रिकाभिश्चकास्ति।  
तदितर दिशि नैवातारतं शीतभानु,  
र्घट इव निजमूर्तिच्छाययैव तपस्थः ॥”**

 चन्द्रमा स्वयं ज्योति रहित है अतः इसमें आसुर प्राण का होना स्वाभाविक होजाता है। जो स्वज्योति न हो अथवा दूसरी ज्योति से भी ज्योतिष्मान् न हो वह रूपज्योति पदार्थ कहलाता है। जैसे पृथ्वी आदि। इसका हमें केवल रूपमात्र ही दृष्टिगत होजाता है। सूर्य की किरणें जो पृथ्वी की प्रत्येक विन्दु से प्रतिफलित होकर हमारी दृष्टि पर पहुँचती हैं वेही तदाकाराकारित होकर पृथ्वी के प्रत्यक्ष का कारण बनती हैं। चन्द्रमा की तरह ज्योतिरूप न बनने से यह परज्योति नहीं कहला सकती।

 जिस तरह चन्द्रमा का एक भाग सूर्य से प्रकाशित और दूसरा अप्रकाशित रहकर वह ‘तम’ (राहु) कहलाता है, इसी प्रकार इस पृथ्वी का जो भाग सूर्य से प्रकाशित रहता है, वह तो रूपज्योति कहलाता है, किन्तु जो भाग अप्रकाशित रहता है वह भाग अन्धकार से आच्छादित होने के कारण श्रज्योति कहलाता है। इससे इस भाग को तम’ भी कहते हैं पृथ्वी की जो तमोमयी छाया के लिये “तमस्तु राहुः स्वर्भानुः” कहा गया है।

**कीलकराहवः।**

 २२२–अन्धकार युक्त होने के कारण प्रकाशित रहित और अदृश्य अनेक पिण्ड शुक्रादि अहों की तरह ये कीलक, राहु, सूर्य, चन्द्रादि के (चारों ओर) अनुगमन करते हैं।

 २२३–चन्द्रमा के समान बड़े बिम्ब वाला त्वष्टा नाम का महाग्रह पर्व विना ही सूर्य मण्डल को अन्धकार युक्त कर देता है।

 २२४–उस त्वष्टां से छोटे बिम्ब वाले तामस कीलक अन्य और भी अनेक ग्रह हैं जो तेतीस हैं और राहु पुत्र तथा राहु के नाम से प्रसिद्ध हैं।

 २२५–ध्वाङ्क्ष, कबन्ध, दण्ड, ध्वज, छत्र और चामर ये तमोग्रह सूर्य में छेद करने वाले कई बार देखे गये हैं।

 २२६–इनके उदय होने पर धूल उड़ाती हुई प्रचण्ड वायु चलती है, आकाश में रज छाजाती है, जल में कलुषता आजाती है और भूकंप होने लगते हैं।

 २२७–कीलकों के प्रभाव से निर्घात (जोर का शब्द) होने लगता है, दिशाओं में दाह होता है, पेड़ो में ऋतु का परिवर्तन होजाता है और पशु पक्षियों में दीप्ति होजाती है।

 २२८–केतु, राहु और कीलकों के दर्शन होने में उनके अलग अलग फल नहीं समझने चाहिये और इनके उत्पात भी भिन्न भिन्न नहीं होते हैं क्योंकि ये उन्हीं से उत्पन्न हैं।

 २२९–जिन जिन देशों में सूर्य विम्बगामी कीलक दिखाई दें उन देशों की प्रजा का अवृष्टि वा अतिवृष्टि से नाश होगा।

 २३०–यदि वे कीलक धूम, स्फुलिङ्ग (अभिकरण आग की चिनगारियाँ) और ज्वाला आदि से युक्त हों तो दुर्भिक्ष, महामारी आदि से प्रजा को अत्यन्त पीड़ा होती है।

 २३१–सूर्य में ये कीलक एक, दो या बहुत दिखाई दें वे सब पाप फल देने वाले होते हैं। दण्ड, ध्वाङ्क्ष, कबन्ध आदि जो तमोग्रह वे यदि चन्द्रमा में दिखाई दें तो शुभ फल होते हैं।

**स्वर्भानुराहवः।**

 २३२–पृथ्वी, चन्द्र, बुध आदि परज्योति पिण्डों के प्रकाश रहित तमोमय आधे भाग को स्वर्भानु कहते हैं।

 २३३–इस तमोमय भाग से उत्पन्न तीन कोण वाली छाया को स्वर्भानु नाम के राहु कहते हैं इनके स्वर्भाग में भानु रहता है, इससे इनको स्वर्भानु कहते हैं।

 २३४–वह छायामयी मूर्ति ज्योतिर राहित्य (प्रकाश रहित) होने से राहु कहलाती है और उस छाया वाले तमोमय आधे भाग को सिंह कहते हैं, इस सिंही से उत्पन्न होने के कारण यह राहु सैंहिकेय भी कहलाता है।

 २३५–अहः (दिन) को मित्र (सूर्य) कहते हैं, इसीसे इसमें देवता रहते हैं। रात्रि वारुणी होती है, इसीसे वह आसुरी कहलाती है। रात्रि में सुदर्शन छिन्न मस्तक वाला राहु असुर जाति का है।

 २३६–वह भू छाया ही तम है, यह तम आकाश में सूर्य के चारों ओर घूमने से ग्रह कहलाता है। भूछाया से निगृहीत चन्द्रमा उपरक्त होजाता है इसी से वह दिखाई नहीं देता।

 २३७–चन्द्रमा की छाया से गृहीत सूर्यग्रहण के समय दिखाई नहीं देता है। इसी प्रकार सूर्य और चन्द्रमा का राहु (तम=छाया) से ग्रस्त होने को ग्रहण कहते हैं।

 २३८–स्वर्भानु के द्वारा तम से सूर्य के उपरक्त होने में श्रुति का प्रमाण निम्ननिर्दिष्ट है—

 भगवती श्रुति कहती है कि जिस सूर्य को स्वर्भानु नामक आसुर ने तम के द्वारा विद्ध किया है उस सूर्य को अत्रि महर्षि ही पहिचान सके हैं और कोई इस सूर्य के पहिचान ने में समर्थ नहीं हो सके।

 २३९–यह तमोग्रह दूर्वा की तरह श्याम रंग का और हरिद्रा के रंग का होतो महामारी होती है, तोते की आभा वाली होतो सस्य (धान्य) नाश होता है और पाटल रंग के होने से वज्रपात होता है।

 २४०–यह ग्रह श्वेत, धूम्र पीत वा स्वच्छ प्रभावाला होतो सुभिक्ष होता है लाल, काला, कबूतरी रंग अथवा कपिल रंग का होतो दुर्भिक्ष का सूचक है।

 २४१–अर्चि (ज्योति) वाला और अग्नि की सी आभा वाला होतो अग्नि का भय होता है। गैरिक रंग का होतो युद्ध और बालसूर्य, इन्द्रधनुष के तथा कमल के से रूप वाला होतो वह शस्त्र का कोप करता है।

 २४२–लाल किरणों वाला, रज, धूम अथवा लाल वर्ण का वृष्टि नाश करने वाला होता है। कुछ धूम्र तथा कृष्ण और कबूतरी रंग का अतिवृष्टि करता है।

 २४३–ग्रस्त को देखकर शनि तो वृष्टि का और शुक्र सस्य का नाश करता है वृहस्पति ग्रस्त को देखकर दुष्ट दृष्टि के दोष को दूर करता है।

 २४४–कार्त्तिक मास में सूर्य चन्द्र का ग्रहण होने से मगध, काशी, कोशल, शूरसेन और कलिङ्ग देश की हानि होती है, अन्य देशों में क्षेम और सुभिक्ष होता है।

 २४५–मार्गशीर्ष में ग्रहण होने से पुण्ड्रक, काश्मीर, कौशल तथा अपरान्तक अर्थात् पश्चिमी देशों की हानि होती है, अवशिष्ट प्रदेशों में वृष्टि, क्षेम और सुभिक्ष होता है।

 २४६–पौष में ग्रहण होने से सिन्धुदेश, विदेह कुकुरदेशों की हानि होती है, अन्य जगह अल्पवृष्टि और दुर्भिक्ष होता है।

 २४७–माघ में ग्रहण होने से राहु काशी, अंग और बंग देशों की हानि करता है और देशान्तरों में कर्षक परिमाण की वर्षा होती है।

 २४८–फाल्गुन में ग्रहण होने से अगुरु, अंग, अवन्तिका, अश्म और मैकल देशों की हानि होती है। चैत्र में ग्रहण होने से कैकय, पौण्ड्र, औड्र, अश्मक देशों में विचित्र वर्षा होती है।

 २४९–वैशाख मास में ग्रहण होने से कलिङ्ग, यौधेय, इक्ष्वाकुज और शकों की हानि होती जेष्ठ में ग्रहण होने से साल्व और निषाद देश का नाश होता है, तथा धान्य और वृष्टि का भी नाश होता है।

 २५०–आषाढ़ मैं ग्रहण के दिखाई देने से चीन, कश्मीर, गान्धार और पुलिन्द देशों का नुकसान होता है और इससे माण्डलिक वर्षा होती है।

 २५१ से २५४–श्रवण का ग्रहण चीन, कश्मीर, गान्धार, पुलिन्द, मध्यदेश, कुरुक्षेत्र, कम्बोज़ और यवनों का नाश करता है, तथा शरत्काल के धान्य का भी नाश करता है, अन्यत्र क्षेमकारी होता है। भाद्रपद में ग्रहण होतो म्लेच्छ देशों का नाश करता है, वह सौराष्ट्र, मगध, सौवीर, दरद, अश्मक, कलिङ्ग, बंग और अन्यत्र सुभिक्षकारी होती है। आश्विन मास का ग्रहण बाह्लीक, चीन, काम्बोज, यवनदेश, किरात, आनर्त्त और पौण्ड्र देश का नुकसान करता है, अन्यन्त्र अत्यन्त सुभिक्षकारी होती है। किसी का मत है कि वैशाख में ग्रहण होतो वह श्रावण से पाँच महीने तक सुभिक्षकारी होता है।

 २५५–ग्रहण के दिन से एक सप्ताह के अन्दर ही यदि, प्रचण्ड पवन, बिजली, गर्जना, सूर्य चन्द्र के परिवेष और भूकंप होवे तो अशुभ समझना चाहिये।

 २५६–ग्रहण के दिन से एक सप्ताह के अन्दर यदि सुवृष्टि होजावे तो ग्रहण के जितने शुभ दोष हैं उनका नाश होजाता है और कल्याण होता है।

**नागराहव।**

 २५७–आकाश में ग्रहगण जिस रास्ते से जाते हुए दिखाई देते हैं, वह रास्ता नाग नाम से कहा जाता है। उस रास्ते में जहाँ ग्रह हो वह उस नाग का मुख कहलाता है।

 २५८–आकाश में जितने ग्रह हैं उतने हीं नाग भी हैं। द्यौ पृथ्वी और अन्तरिक्ष में अनन्त नाग हैं, किन्तु उनमें आठ ही प्रधान हैं।

**पातराहव।**

 २५९–ग्रहों की अपनी कक्षाओं के वृत्तों के जितने संयोग हैं, वे २१ पात कहे जाते हैं। इन्ही पातों से ग्रह दक्षिण या उत्तर होते हैं।

 २६०–दक्षिण पति को राहु और उत्तर पात को केतु कहा गया है।ग्रह राहु के उत्तर से और केतु के दक्षिण से जाते हैं।

 २६१–पात सभी राहु कहलाते हैं, किन्तु इसी की फिर दो संज्ञा होजाती है। दक्षिण पात और उत्तर पात को केतु कहने लगते हैं।

 २६२–पात (ग्रह कक्षावृत्त के संयोग) के स्थान स्थित अत्यन्त नजदीक जब दो ग्रह होजाते हैं तब ग्रहण या ग्रहयुति होती है। इस लिये योग दो प्रकार का माना गया है–ग्रहण और युति।

 २६३–सूर्य और चन्द्र के ग्रहण के विषय में शुभाशुभ फल कहा जा चुका है। अब तारा ग्रहों के ग्रहण का फल कहा जाता है।

 २६४–पात के अस्थिर होने से अविक्षिप्त एक नक्षत्र वाले ताराग्रह का बिम्ब जब सूर्य वा चन्द्रमा के द्वारा ग्रस्त होजाता है तब उसे [ग्रहण]("बहिर्ग्रहों का पृथ्वी के द्वारा स्वच्छाया से खुद का ही ग्रहण होता है किन्तु अन्तर्ग्रहों का ग्रहण चिन्ह सूर्य पर दिखाई देता है।") कहते हैं।

 २६५–मंगल के ग्रहण होने पर अवन्तिका (उज्जैन), काबेरी और नर्मदा के किनारे के सब देशों को पीड़ा होती है।

 २६६–बुध के ग्रहण होने पर गंगा-यमुना के मध्यदेश, सरयू और शोणा नदी के तटवर्ती पूर्व समुद्र के देश और नेपाल ये पीड़ित होते हैं।

 २६७–बृहस्पति में राहु के ग्रस्त होने पर उत्तर दिशा के देश और देश सिन्धु-तट के आश्रित देश परिपीड़ित होते हैं।

 २६८–शुक्र के ग्रस्त होने पर दासेरक, कैकेय, यौधेय, शिवयोजन और आर्यावर्त्त देश पीड़ित होते हैं।

 २६९–शनि के ग्रस्त होने पर अर्बुद (आबू) और परियात्र के (अरावली) प्रदेश तथा पुष्कर के पास वाले सौराष्ट्र (काठियावाड़) और मरुप्रान्त (मारवाड़) के देश पीड़ित होते हैं।

 २७०–जो २१ पात कहे गये हैं, वे गतिमान हैं अर्थात् स्थिर नहीं हैं। इस समय जहाँ जो पात हैं वे पृथक् २ बताये जाते हैं।

**सूर्यपात।**

 २७१–शनि और सूर्य का संपात हस्त के आधे व्यतीत होने पर और पूषा (रेवती) के अन्त होने पर चौथी और दशवीं राशि के अठारहवें अंश में होता है।

 २७२–बृहस्पति और सूर्य का संपात आर्द्रा नक्षत्र के तृतीय भाग और रेवती के आदि भाग में चौथी और दशवीं राशि के दशम भाग में दिखाई देता है।

 २७३–मंगल और सूर्य का संपात भरणी के अन्त में और विशाखा के अर्ध में दूसरी और आठवीं राशि के अठारहवें अंश में दिखाई पड़ता है।

 २७५–बुध और सूर्य का संपात भरणी के अन्त में, विशाखा के आधे भाग में दूसरी और आठवीं राशि के सत्रहवें अंश में होता है।

 २७६–२७७–क्रान्तिपात से १०८ अंश पर सूर्य के रहने पर (सूर्य में) शनि का पात होता

है, १०० अंश पर सूर्य के रहने पर गुरु का पात, ४८ अंश पर सूर्य के रहने से मंगल का पात ७७ वें अंश पर सूर्य के रहने पर शुक्र का पात और ४७ वें अंश पर बुध का पात होना पंडितों के द्वारा देखा गया है।

**चन्द्रपात।**

 २७८–सूर्य के मार्ग में चन्द्रमार्ग का संपात (संयोग) होना चन्द्रपात कहलाता है। यह दो प्रकार का होता है। इनमें दक्षिण वाला राहु और उत्तर वाला केतु कहा जाता है।

 २७९–सूर्य मार्ग में राहु प्रतिदिन पश्चिम दिशा की तरफ जाता रहता है। इसकी नित्य की गति ३ कला और १०॥ विकला की होती है।

 २८०–प्राचीन ऋषियों का मत है कि इस राहु की दैनिक गति ३ कला, १० विकल ओर ६८ अनु विकला की होती है।

 २८१–इस राहु की वार्षिक गति १९ अंश, १९ कला और ४४ विकला की होती है।

 २८२–यह राहु अपने एक चक्र को १८ वर्ष, २२८ दिन और १५ घडियों में भोग लेता है।

 २८३–सत्रह अंश और २१ कला के पश्चात् पात के समीप चन्द्रमा के आने पर अमावास्या के अन्त में सूर्य का ग्रहण होता है।

 २८४–ग्यारह अंश और ३४ कला के पश्चात् पात के संनिहित यदि चन्द्रमा होता है तो पूर्णिमा में उस चन्द्र का ग्रहण होजाता है।

**ताराग्रहपात।  
(शनि–संपात)**

 २८५–२८६–क्रान्ति राशि से पाँचवीं और ग्यारहवीं के छठे अंश में श्रवण के प्रथम चरण और पुष्य के तृतीय चरण में शनि और वृहस्पति का संपात होता है और छठी तथा बारहवीं राशि के अठारहवें अंश में, पूर्व फाल्गुनी के चौथे और पूर्व भाद्रपद के द्वितीय अंश में शनि और मंगल का संपात होता है।

**(तारा–चन्द्र–संपात)**

 २९५–चन्द्रमा का मार्ग ऊँचा नीचा है, यह नित्य ही विशेषता को अर्थात् भिन्न-भिन्न प्रकार को प्राप्त होता रहता है। अतः बुद्धिमान् लोग चन्द्र के साथ पाँच पात स्वयं ही जानलें।

इति प्रकीर्ण के चतुर्विधराहवः।

**केतवः।**

 २९६–कभी-कभी आकाश में विकीर्ण (बिखरे हुए) तेज वाले स्वप्रकाशमय पिण्ड दिखाई दिया करते हैं, ये ही पिण्ड केतु कहलाते हैं।

 २९७–भूमि पर [इन्द्रगोपकृमि]("एक प्रकार का कीड़ा जो प्रायः बरसात में पैदा होता है और वह चमकीला होता है।"), जिन्द वगैरह का स्थान, रत्न और मणि को छोड़कर, तथा आकाश में उल्काग्रह नक्षत्र को छोड़कर अग्नि रहित स्थान में जो ज्योति दिखाई पड़ती हैं वे केतु हैं।

 २९८–इन केतु पिण्डों की संख्या को गग आदि ऋषि एक हजार बताते हैं, पराशर आदि ऋषि एक सौ और नारद ऋषि एक ही संख्या मानते हैं।

 २९९–ये केतु कितने दिनों तक दिखाई देते हैं, नक्षत्रों का उदयास्त का स्वरूप क्या है, यह सब पुराविदों ने यद्यपि देखा है तथापि दुःख का विषय है कि उनने इसको स्पष्ट करके नहीं दिखाया है।

 ३००–अतः इनका न तो ठीक ठीक विज्ञान है, न इनकी गति ही निश्चित की गई है, किन्तु इनकी संख्या और फल जो मालूम है वह कहा जाता है।

 ३०१ से ३०३–ये केतु हजार माने गये हैं। इनकी निम्निलिखित १९ जातियाँ है। किरण, आग्नेय, मृत्युद, पार्थिव, सोमज, ब्रह्मदण्ड, विसर्पक, तस्कर, कोङ्कुम, कील, कनक, विकच, अरुण, विश्वरूप, गणक, ब्रह्मज, कंक, कबन्ध और विपुल। इनके लक्षण और विशेष संख्या क्रम आगे लिखते हैं—

 ३२३–*विपुल* नाम केतु ९ होते हैं। इनका श्वेत तारों का एक ही बड़ा पॅज होता है। इस प्रकार हजार केतुओं की १९ प्रकार की जातियाँ कही गई हैं।

![](../books_images/U-IMG-1729160544r2.png)

 ३२४ –पराशर आदि ऋषियों से जो केतु देखे गये हैं, वे रूप, काल, फल आदि से गिना दिये गये हैं।

 उपरिलिखित केतुओं के अतिरिक्त जो अन्य केतु विशेष हैं उनका दिग् दर्शन आगे किया जाता है।

 ३२५–चल, जल, ऊर्मि आदि आठ, भट, श्रद्दालक, पद्म, काश्यप, आवर्त्त और रश्मिकेतु–इनका उदय क्रम से होता है।

 ३२६ –बसाकेतु, कुमुदकेतु, कपालकेतु, मणिकेतु और कलिकेतु ये भी क्रमसे उदय होते हैं, किन्तु कई ऋषियों का मत है कि इनके उदय में क्रम नहीं होता।

 ३२७–दाहिने हाथ के अंगुल के सदृश उन्नत शिखा वाला, उत्तर की तरफ जाता हुआ, लम्बा होता हुआ और शूलाग्र की तरह शिखा वाला चलकेतु होता है।

 ३२८–यह चलकेतु पश्चिम में उदय हुआ उत्तर दिशा के अन्दर सप्तर्षि मण्डल की ओर जाकर ध्रुव, अभिजित् और ब्रह्मराशि को देखकर लौट जाता है।

 ३२९–आकाश में ऊँचा जाकर यह दक्षिण में अस्त होजाता है। ११५ वर्ष तक प्रवासित रहकर यह पुनः दिखाई देता है।

 ३३०–यह दक्षिण में अवन्ती (उज्जैन) तक, उत्तर में देविका तक और पुष्कर से प्रयाग तक सब को दश महीने तक पीड़ित करता है।

**जलकेतुः।**

 ३३१–जलकेतु पश्चिमाग्र शिखा वाला होता है। स्निग्धचलकेतु के अस्त होने में जब नव मास शेष रह जाते हैं तब यह पश्चिम में उदय होता है।

 ३३२–यह नौ महीने तक सुभिक्ष, क्षेम और आरोग्य करता है और अन्य ग्रहों के सब दोषों को भी नष्ट करता है।

**ऊर्मि-शीत-केतवः।**

 ३३३–जलकेतु के कर्मान्त गति में आगे लिखे ऊर्मिकेतु से शीत पर्यन्त के आठ केतु क्रमशः १८ वर्ष और १४ वर्ष के अन्तर पर उदय होते रहते हैं।

 ३३४–ऊर्मि, शंख, हिम, रक्त, कुक्षि, काम, विसर्पण और शीत ये आठ अमृत से पैदा हुए सहज केतु हैं।

 ३३५–ये आठ ऊर्मि आदि केतु यदि रूक्ष होतो क्षुद्र जन्तुओं के नाश करने वाले और दुर्भिक्ष आदि अशुभ फल देने वाले होते हैं। ये ही यदि स्निग्ध होतो सुभिक्ष और क्षेम करते हैं

 ३५०–वसाकेतु अत्यन्त स्निग्ध सुभिक्ष और महामारी प्रद होता है। यह १३० वर्ष प्रवासित रहकर उत्तर की ओर लम्बा होता हुआ उदय होता है।

 ३५१–बसाकेतु के समान अस्थिकेतु रूक्ष हो तो क्षुद् भयावह होता है (भुखमरा पड़ता है) पश्चिम में बसाकेतु की समानता का दीखा हुआ शस्त्रकेतु महामारी करता है।

**कुमुदकेतु।**

 ३५२–कुमुद की आभावाला, पूर्व की तरफ शिखावाला, स्निग्ध और दुग्ध की तरह स्वच्छ कुमुदकेतु पश्चिम में वसाकेतु की गति के अन्त में दिखाई देता है।

 ३५३–एक ही रात में दिखाई दिया हुआ यह सुभिक्ष और दशवर्ष तक सुहृद्भाव पैदा करता है, किन्तु पाश्च्यात्त्य देशों में कुछ रोग उत्पन्न करता है।

**कपालकिरणः।**

 ३५४–कपालकेतु प्राची दिशा में अमावास्या के दिन उदय हुआ आकाश के मध्य में धूम्र किरणों की शिखावाला होकर रोग, वृष्टि, भूख और मृत्यु को देता है।

 ३५५–यह १२५ वर्ष प्रवास में रहकर अमृतोत्पन्न कुमुदकेतु के अन्त में तीन पक्ष से अधिक उदय रहता है।

 ३५६–जितने दिन तक यह दिखता रहता है, उतने हीं महीनों तक इसका फल मिलता है। जितने मास और वर्ष तक दीखता है, उससे तीन पक्ष अधिक फल रहता है।

**मणिकेतुः।**

 ३६१–इसकी शिखा तीक्ष्ण, रूखी धूमिल, ताँबे की तरह लाल, शूल की आकृति वाली और दक्षिण की ओर झुकी हुई होती है जिसका फल तेरहवें महीने होता है।

 ३६२–जितने महींने यह दिखाई देता है उतने हीं वर्ष तक इसका भय समझना चाहिये। उतने वर्षों तक भूख, अनावृष्टि, महामारी आदि रोगों से प्रजा को दुःख होता है।

**संवर्त्तकेतुः।**

 ३६३–यह संवर्त्तकेतु १००८ वर्ष तक प्रवास में रहकर पश्चिम में सायंकाल के समय आकाश के तीन अंशों को आक्रमण करके दिखाई देता है।

**अमृतकेतु।**

 ३६९–जल, भट, पद्म, आवर्त, कुमुद, मणि और संवर्त ये सात केतु प्रकृतिसेही अमृतोत्पन्न माने जाते हैं।

**दुष्टकेतुफलम्।**

 ३७० से ३७३–जो दुष्टकेतु हैं वे क्रमसे अश्विनी आदि २७ नक्षत्रों में गये हुए निम्नलिखित देशों के नरेशों का नाश करते हैं।

[TABLE]

 ३७४–जितने दिनों तक ये दीखते हैं, उतने हीं महीनों तक और जितने महीनों तक दीखें उतने वर्षों तक इनका फल मिलता है। जब वे दीखें उसके तीन पक्ष आगे फल देते हैं।

 ३७५–जिन केतुओं की शिखा उल्का से ताड़ित होरही हो वे केतु हूण, अफगान, चीन, और चोल से अन्यत्र देशों में श्रेयस्कर होते हैं।

 ३७६–जो केतु शुक्ल, स्निग्धतनु, ह्रस्व, प्रसन्न, थोड़े समय ही दिखने वाला सीधा हो और जिसके उदय होने से वृष्टि हुई हो वह शुभ फलदायी होता है।

इति केतवः

**३–तारा।**

 ३७७–जिस महीने में स्वच्छ स्फटिक (बिल्लोर) मणि की सी आभावाली तारों की पंक्ति चमकती हो उस मास में सुभिक्ष करने के लिये मेघ अवश्य ही आता है।

 ३७८–सात रात तक जल की आभावाली तारों की पंक्ति जब दिखाई देती हो तब सुभिक्ष के लिये यही वृष्टि होगी, यह समझना चाहिये।

 ३७९–जो तारों की पंक्ति प्रतिक्षण चंचल सुन्दर कान्ति से स्फुरण करती हुई दिखाई देती हो तो वह अत्यन्त वर्षा करके तत्काल चमत्कार सा बता देती है।

**४–दिग्दाहः।**

 ३८०–सूर्य से छठी राशि पर मंगल हो और पाँचवें वा सातवें स्थान पर चन्द्रमा हो तो यह योग दिग्दाह पैदा करने वाला समझना चाहिये। यह दिग्दर्शन के नाम से माना गया है।

 ३८१–सांयकाल और प्रातः काल लाल रंग वाला दिग्दाह होता हो और उलटी हवा चलती हो तो इससे धान्य का नाश होता है। अन्य वर्ण का भी दिग्दाह होता हो तो वह अशुभ ही है।

 ३८२–जो दिग्दाह सुनहरी वर्ण का हो, दाहिनी हवा चलती हो और आकाश प्रसन्न तथा निर्मल हो तो वह सब लोगों का हितकर होता है।

 ३८३–नारद ऋषि का मत हैं कि-धूम्रवर्ण का दिग्दाह धान्यनाश करता है, अरुण (लाल) रंग का, वायु चलाता है और सुनहरी रंग का शुभकर होता है।

**५**–**पांसवः।**

 ३८४–भूमि से उठी हुई पांसु (रज) तमाम दिशाओं को ढक लेती है इसके छाये हुए अन्धकार से सामने भी वृक्ष पर्वत आदि दिखाई नहीं देते हैं।

 ३८५–वायु के बिना उठा हुआ रज यदि अन्धकार करदे तो वह सात पक्षों से अर्थात साढ़े तीन महीनों में वहाँ निश्चय वर्षा करेगा।

 ३८६–धूमि का (धुन्ध) वा तुषार (बर्फ़) जहाँ अन्धकार करता है, वहाँ ग्यारहवें पक्ष में अवश्य वर्षा होती है।

 ३८७–यदि गुडहल के फूल अथवा अञ्जन के चूर्ण की आभावाली रज सायंकाल के सूर्य के सामने जाती हो तो संसार रोगों से पीड़ित होता है। यदि बद्द रज श्वेत हो तो आनन्द प्राप्त होता है।

 ३८८–यदि यह रज शिशिरऋतु में दिखाई दे तो उसे दोषकारक नहीं समझना चाहिये, क्योंकि वह उस ऋतु में प्रकृति से अवश्य उत्पन्न होती ही है। यही रज अन्य ऋतुओं में होने से रोगादि दोषों को पैदा करती है।

**६–भूकम्प।**

 ३८९–भूकम्प *ऐन्द्र, वारुण, वायव्य* और *आग्नेय* होते हैं। जिनमें से केवल ऐन्द्र भूकम्प होने का यह साधारण कारण है कि- राहु से सातवें मंगल होने पर, मंगल से पाँचवें बुध होने पर और बुध से चौथे चन्द्रमा के होने पर भूकम्प होता है।

 ३९०–दिन के प्रथम, द्वितीय, तृतीय और चतुर्थ भाग क्रम से वायु, अग्नि, इन्द्र और वरुण के मण्डल कहे जाते हैं।

 ३९१–स्वाति, चित्रा, उत्तराफाल्गुनी, हस्त, मृगशिर, अश्विनी, पुनर्वसु ये *वायव्य मण्डल* के हैं, सात दिन के बाद इनके रूप का दर्शन होता है।

 ३९२–धूम्र से कुलित दिशावाले आकाश में वायु भूमि की रज को फैलाता हुआ और पेड़ों को उखाड़ता हुआ चलता है और सूर्य मन्दकान्ति होजाता है।

 ३९३–पुष्य, कृत्तिका, विशाखा, पूर्वभाद्रपद, भरणी, पूर्वफाल्गुनी और मघा यह नक्षत्र मण्डल *आग्नेय मण्डल* कहलाता है। एक सप्ताह पर इसका रूप दर्शन होता है।

 ३९४–इसका यह फल होता है कि अत्युष्ण वायु चले, आकाश से तारा उल्का गिरें, सन्ध्या के समय नित्य दिशायें जलती हुई दिखाई दें और आकाश भी आदीप्तसा दिखाई देवे।

 ३९५–रोहिणी, ज्येष्ठा, वैश्व (उत्तराषाढ़) अनुराधा, धनिष्ठा, श्रवण, अभिजित् यह *ऐन्द्र मण्डल* कहलाता है, सप्ताह के बाद इसका रूप दर्शन होता है।

 ३९६–इससे चारों ओर पर्वतों के से आकार वाले, बिजली वाले, जोर की आवाज वाले गवल (भैंसे का सींग) भौंरों के कुल और साँपों की सी आभावाले मेघ बरसते हैं।

 ३९७–अश्लेषा, आर्द्रा, पूर्वाषाढ़, रेवती, मूल, उ० भाद्र और वारुण नक्षत्र यह *वारुण मण्डल* कहलाता है। इसका एक सप्ताह के बाद रूप दर्शन होता है।

 ३९८–इससे ज्यादातर-मधुर आवाज वाले, नीले, काले अञ्जन की कान्तिवाले, बिजली से चमकते हुए और अत्यन्त जल देने वाले मेघ वर्षा करते हैं।

 ३९९–वायव्य मण्डल संबन्धी भूमिकंप होतो जल धान्य और औषधियों का नाश होता है, तथा मत्स्यदेश (जयपुर प्रान्त), दशार्ण (धारानगर) देश, सौराष्ट्र, मगध और कुरु देशों में पीड़ा होती है।

 ४००–अग्नि मण्डल संबन्धी भूमि कंप होने पर मेघ और जलाशयों का नाश होता है तथा अंग, बंग, कलिङ्ग, बाह्लीक, द्रविड़ और अश्मक देशों में पीड़ा होती है।

 ४०१–ऐन्द्रमंण्डल संबन्धी भूकंप होने से यथेष्ट वर्षा होती है। किन्तु काशी, सुवासु, मालत्रा, आबू और पौरव ( हस्तिनापुर ) देशों में पीड़ा होती है।

 ४०२–वारुण मण्डल में भूकंप होने से महावृष्टि होती है। तथा चेदि, गोनद, वैदेह, किरात, देशों की क्षति होती है।

 ४०३–समय और नक्षत्र मण्डल के भिन्न होने पर अर्थात् यदि नक्षत्र किसी दूसरे मण्डल का हो और समय दूसरे मण्डल का हो तो एक दूसरे का फल नष्ट होजाता है। किन्तु ऐन्द्र और वारुण मण्डल के योग में भूकंप होने से सुभिक्ष होता है और अच्छी वर्षा होती है।

 ४०५–चार पक्षों (२ मास) से वायु का, तीन पक्षों से अग्नि का, एक सप्ताह से इन्द्र का, और वरुण का तत्काल ही पाक हो जाता है। इसका काल नहीं कहा गया है।

 ४०६–प्रत्यर्क(सूर्य का) परिवेष, अभ्र, इन्द्र धनुष, अमोघ, तड़ित, रज और परिघादि ये एक दिन में तीन दिन में अथवा सात दिन में फल देते हैं।

 ४०७–वायु के द्वारा कंप होने से २०० योजन तक भूमि हिलती है, वरुण के द्वारा होने से ८०, इन्द्र के द्वारा ६० और अग्नि के द्वारा होने से ११० योजन तक भूमि हिलती है।

 ४०८–सन्ध्या १ योजन तक, उपार्क (प्रत्यर्क-परिधि) ३ योजन तक, धनुष १० योजन तक, निर्घोष तथा परिघ ५ योजन तक और परिवेष तथा बिजली ६ योजन तक दिखाई देती हैं।

 ४०९–उल्का पतन में योजनों की कोई संख्या नियत नहीं है, ये जहाँ गिरें वहीं इनका फल समझना चाहिए।

**तज्ज्ञानाय निमित्तं स्याद्बहुभेदं चतुर्विधम्।  
पार्थिवं चान्तरिक्षं च दिव्यं मिश्रमिति क्रमात्॥२॥**

 १–हस्ती (सूर्य) अपनी किरणों के द्वारा समुद्र से जल लेकर बादलों को देता है और वायु के द्वारा प्रेरित हुए बादल यथा समय, यथा स्थान में वर्षा करते हैं।

 २–इस वर्षा के जानने के लिए अनेक भेद वाले निमित्त (शाकुनादिक) पार्थिव, अन्तरिक्ष, दिव्य और मिश्र इस प्रकार से चार तरह के कहे गये हैं। अब आगे के अधिकरणों में इन्हीं चारों का विवरण लिखा जाता है।

**मिश्रनिमित्ताधिकारः।**

**वृष्टिः प्रश्नार्थशकुने श्यामगोघटदर्शनम्।

**तत्कालघटिकद्विघ्ना त्रिहृतैकेन सत्वरम्।  
द्वाभ्यां किञ्चिद्विलम्बेन शून्यशेषे त्ववर्षणम्॥७॥**

 ३–यदि कोई वर्षा के विषय में प्रश्न करे और उस वृष्टि प्रश्न के शकुन में काली गाय, घट अथवा काले वस्त्र पहिने हुये स्त्री के दर्शन हो तो वर्षा होगी ऐसा कहना चाहिये।

 ४–वर्षा का प्रश्न करने वाला जल के समीप हो, वा जल या किसी आर्द्र वस्तु को स्पर्श कर रहा हो, अथवा उस समय जल का शब्द सुनाई देता हो तो शीघ्रही वर्षा का आगमन कहना चाहिये।

 ५–वर्षा का प्रश्न करने के समय बाँईं तरफ से स्वर चलता हो तो वर्षा कहनी चाहिये। दक्षिण की ओर से यदि स्वर चलता हो तो अनावृष्टि कहनी चाहिये।

 ६ –वर्षा संबन्धी प्रश्न करने वाले से दाइने हाथ के उंगलियों को स्पर्श कराने पर यदि वह अंगुष्ठ का स्पर्श करे तो अधिक वर्षा हो, तथा सावित्री (कनिष्ठिका) के स्पर्श करने पर अल्पवर्षा होती है। शेष उंगलियों के स्पर्श से सामान्य वर्षा समझनी चाहिये।

 ७–सूर्योदय से प्रश्न करने के समय तक की घटिकाओं को दो से गुणा करे और फिर तीन से भाग देवे; यदि एक शेष रहे तो शीघ्र वर्षा होती है, दो शेष रहै तो कुछ देरी से और शेष शून्य रहे तो वृष्टि कहनी चाहिये।

**इति ऋतुज्यौतिषम्।**

 ८–वर्षाऋतु में वृष्टि के विषय में प्रश्न करने के समय यदि तोयलग्न हो अर्थात लग्नस्थान में जलराशि हो और जल सम्बन्धी वारुणनक्षत्र हो तथा शुभग्रहों के द्वारा देखे जाने वाले केन्द्र स्थान में चन्द्रमा या शुक्र हो तो शीघ्र ही वर्षा कहनी चाहिये।

 ९–प्रश्नकाल के लग्नस्थान में वा जलराशि के स्थान में चन्द्रमा हो तो बहुत जल गिरता। यदि प्रश्न लग्न में शनि, बुध और चन्द्रमा हों तो ओले गिरते हैं।

 (जल नक्षत्र ये हैं–हस्त, चित्रा, स्त्राति, मूल, पू.षा, श्रवण, पूर्वभाद्र, रेवती, भरणी, तीनों उत्तरा, रोहिणी। १३)।

 १०–प्रश्नलग्न के स्थान में मंगल के होने से खूब बिजलियाँ चमकती हैं और घनघोर गर्जना के साथ खूब वृष्टि होती है।

 ११–प्रश्नलग्न में यदि चन्द्रमा, मंगल, शुक्र और शनि ये सब एक साथ हों तो वायु साथ ओलों की वर्षा होती है और चारों ओर बिजली चमकती है।

 १२–प्रश्नकाल के केन्द्र-स्थान में कर्क, मकर या मीनराशि के होने पर तथा क्रूर ग्रह (राहु, केतु, शनि) से वर्जित पूर्ण चन्द्रमा, बुध, शुक्र और वृहस्पति इनके बलवान् होने पर वृष्टि कहनी चाहिये।

 १३–प्रश्नकाल के लग्नस्थान में जलराशिगत ग्रहों के होने से तीसरे हिस्से की वर्षा कहनी चाहिए तथा केन्द्रस्थ ग्रह सजल तथा जलराशिगत हो तो अनावृष्टि समझनी चाहिए।

 १४–लग्न या केन्द्रस्थान में अक्रूर (शुभ) ग्रहों के होने से एक पाद कम अर्थात् पौनवृष्टि होती है तथा शुष्कलग्न हो अर्थात् लग्न में जलराशि न हो और क्रूर ग्रह हों तो वृष्टि का अवरोध (रुकावट) समझना चाहिये।

 १५–प्रश्नलग्न की कुण्डली में यदि सब ग्रह चर राशि में हों तो बारह प्रहर के अन्दर अन्दर वृष्टि होती है, यदि लग्नस्थान में जलराशि हो और शुभ ग्रहों से युक्त हों तो तत्काल वर्षा आती है।

 १६–प्रश्नलग्न के धनस्थान (दूसरे स्थान) में शुभ ग्रह हो, तथा लग्नराशि चर अर्थात् मेष, कर्क, तुला वा मकर हो तो १ मास में वर्षा होती है। स्थिर राशि–वृष, सिंह, वृश्चिक वा कुभ होतो २४ दिन में और द्विस्वभाव राशि मिथुन, कन्या, धन वा मीन होतो ३६ दिन में वर्षा समझनी चाहिये।

 १७–लग्न से दूसरे वा तीसरे स्थान में भी यदि जलराशि हो और जल-नक्षत्र भी वहाँ हो निश्चय से वृष्टि होती है।

 १८–लग्नस्थान से दूसरे वा तीसरे स्थान में लग्न का स्वामी हो और वह शुभ ग्रहों से युक्त हो तो २७ दिन में नदी के भरने लायक वर्षा आती है।

 १९–लग्न में चतुर्थस्थान में चन्द्रमा, बुध, शुक्र और वृहस्पति यदि स्थित हों तो महावृष्टि के द्वारा वहाँ सुभिक्ष होता है।

 २०–प्रश्नलग्न से चतुर्थस्थान में शनि और राहु हों तो वहाँ उस वर्ष में भयंकर दुर्भिक्ष समझना चाहिये \।

 २१–प्रश्न लग्न की कुंडली में चन्द्रमा और सूर्य से चौथे, आठवें या सातवें स्थान में शुक्र और शनि के होने से वर्षों काल में वृष्टि होती है। इसी तरह लग्न से सातवें और दूसरे स्थान पर भी इन्ही दोनों शुक्र और शनि के होने से वर्षा होती है।

 २२–चारों केन्द्रों के अर्थात् कुण्डली के प्रथम, चतुर्थ, सप्तम और दशम स्थानों के बीच में जिस दिशा की तरफ के केन्द्र में शुभग्रह हों उसी दिशा में अच्छी धान्योत्यत्ति और अच्छा सुभिक्ष होता है।

 २३–जिस दिशा में शनि देखा गया हो अर्थात् जिस दिशा में शनिस्थित हो और क्रूरग्रह ( राहु, केतु ) भी वहाँ स्थित हों तो उस दिशा में निस्सन्देह दुर्भिक्ष समझना चाहिये।

 २४–यदि कोई प्रश्न करे कि इस मेरे क्षेत्र (खेत) में अच्छी वर्षा होगी या नहीं तो इसका उत्तर पण्डितों को लग्न, चौथे और दशवें घर की श्रेष्ठता देखकर कहना चाहिये।

 २५–वृष्टि संबन्धी प्रश्न लग्न में तुला, सिंह या वृष शनि के होने पर मूषक और शलभ (टिड्डी) पैदा होते हैं। मकर, मेष, वृश्चिक और कुंभ के होने पर वायु, वन्हि और ईली आदि का भय रहता है।

 २६–इसी तरह वृष्टि संबन्धी प्रश्न लग्न में मिथुन, मीन, धनु, और कन्या राशि के होने से जल और शीत से कष्ट होता है। किन्तु स्वामी के दृष्टि होने से अल्प कष्ट होता है। अर्थात् उस राशि का स्वामी उसे देखता हो तो अधिक हानि नहीं होती है।

 २७–लग्न बल से धान्य की अधिकता होती है, चतुर्थ स्थान के बल से क्षेत्रसम्पत् होती है, और खबल (दशम स्थान के बल) से कर्म की सफलता होती है। तथा अच्छे ग्रहों का बल होना बल कारक होता है।

 २८–लग्नस्थान से चौथे स्थान में चन्द्र शुक्र आदि के होने से महावृष्टि समझी जाती है। इसी चौथे स्थान में शनि-राहु आदि क्रूर ग्रहों के होने से अनावृष्टि होती है–इस तरह विद्वान् लोग कहते हैं।

 २९–ख मध्य (दशम स्थान) में दो शुभग्रहों के होने से विवाह आदि के समय में वर्षा होती है। लग्नस्थान में यदि तीन शुभप्रद हों तो महावृष्टि समझनी चाहिये।

**इति प्रश्न ज्यौतिषम्।**

 ३०–सूर्य के दक्षिणायन के समय के लग्न में कन्या, मिथुन और मीन राशियों में यदि शुक्र, बुध, चन्द्रमा और वृहस्पति हों तो अच्छी वृष्टि समझनी चाहिये तथा शनि, मंगल और राहु के होने से अल्प वृष्टि होती है।

 ३१–३२–दक्षिणायन के आरंभ में कर्क या वृषराशि में शुक्र और बुध के होने से, मीन और कन्या में वृहस्पति और चन्द्रमा के होने से, मिथुन वा मेष में शुक्र बुध के होने से अथवा धनु राशि में चन्द्र और बृहस्पति के होने से तथा तुला, वृश्चिक और सिंह राशि में पाप ग्रहों के होने से वृष्टि होती है। कर्क और वृषराशि में शनि और मंगल ग्रह हों और मिथुन में राहु हो तो अल्प वृष्टि होती है।

 ३३–एक स्थान में शुभ और अशुभ अर्थात् अधिक तथा कम वर्षा करने वाले ग्रहों के मेल से फल भी मिश्रित ही अर्थात् साधारण ही होता है। सूर्य में (अर्थात् सूर्य जहाँ स्थित हो उस स्थान में) यदि क्रूरग्रह स्थित हों तथा उन्हें बृहस्पति देखता हो तो वर्षा मध्यम होती है।

**इत्ययनज्यौतिषम्।**

 ३४–ग्रह यदि आगे की तरफ से अथवा पीछे की ओर से सूर्य के समीप जा रहे हों तो वे वृष्टि करते हैं, किन्तु वे महवक्री (उलटे चलने वाले) न हों।

 ३५–बुध-शुक्र के संयोग में, बुध और वृहस्पति के संयोग में और वृहस्पति-शुक्र के संयोग में जल गिरता है वा वायु चलती है। शनि और मंगल के संयोग में बन्हि (भांग) बरसती है।

 ३६–चन्द्रमा यदि शुक्र से सातवें स्थान में, शनि से सप्तम स्थान में त्रिकोण का होता हो तथा जल राशि में शुक्र बैठा हो तो शीघ्र ही वर्षा होती है।

 ३७–नारद ऋषि कहते हैं–वृहस्पति से सातवीं राशि में यदि शुक्र स्थित हो तो वर्षा ऋतु के समाप्त होने पर भी खूब वर्षा होती है।

 ३८–वर्षाऋतु में प्रश्नकाल के लग्नचक्र में चन्द्रमा और सूर्य से चौथे, आठवें या सातवें स्थान में अथवा लग्न से सातवें और दूसरे स्थान में शुक्र और शनि के होने से वृष्टि होती है।

 ३९–‘मयूर चित्र’ नामक वृष्टि-विद्या-सम्बन्धी पुस्तक में लिखा है–कि “वर्षा ऋतु जिस दिन सूर्य अत्यन्त जोशीला, दुस्सह और घृत के रंग की तरह प्रभावाला हो तो उस दिन वह अवश्य वर्षा करता है।

 ४०-४१–वर्षा काल में जिस दिन उदय के समय का सूर्य अत्यन्त प्रकाश के कारण देखा न जा सके, पिघले हुए सुवर्ण के समान हो, स्निग्ध वैदूर्यमणि की सी प्रभावाला हो और अत्यन्त तीव्र होकर तप रहा हो अथवा आकाश में बहुत ऊँचा चढ़ गया हो तो वह उसी दिन खूब अच्छी वर्षा करता है।

 ४२–उदय वा अस्त के समय में सूर्य अथवा चन्द्रमा फीका होकर शहद के से रंग का हो और प्रचंड हवा चले तो अतिवृष्टि होती है।

 ४३–सूर्य की अमोघ किरणें सन्ध्या के समय यदि निकली रहें और बादल पृथ्वी पर झुके रहें तो ये महावृष्टि के लक्षण समझने चाहिये। सूर्य पिण्ड से एक प्रकार की जो सीधी रेखा कभी–कभी दिखाई देती है वह अमोघ किरण कहलाती है।

 ४४–चन्द्रमा यदि कबूतर और तोते की आँखों के सदृश हो अथवा शहद के रंग का हो और आकाश में यदि चन्द्रमा का दूसरा प्रतिविम्ब भी दिखाई देता हो तो शीघ्र ही वर्षा आती है।

 ४५–चन्द्रमा के परिवेष कृकवाक की आँखों के समान हो तो वे वृष्टि के सूचक होते हैं और यदि आकाश तीतर के पंखों के समान बादलों से आच्छादित हो तो वृष्टि होती है।

 ४६–चन्द्रमा में परिवेष हो, तारा-गण में तीव्र प्रकाश हो और बादलों की आभा तीतरों के पाँखों की सी होतो अवश्य मेघ बरसता है।

 ४७–दिशायें विमल हों और आकाश काक के अंडे की कान्ति वाला हो, वायु का आगमन रुककर होता हो एवं आकाश गोनेत्र की सी कान्ति वाला हो तो यह भी वृष्टि के आगमन का लक्षण है।

 ४८–उदय होता हुआ सूर्य जोशीला हो, आकाश गौर वर्ण का हो और संध्या खिली हुई हो तो अति वृष्टि होगी।

 ४९–रात में तारे चमकते हों, प्रातःकाल अत्यन्त लालवर्ण का सूर्य उदय होता हो और बिना वर्षा के समय इन्द्रधनुष होता हो तो ये लक्षण तत्काल वृष्टि के समझने चाहिये।

 ५०–प्रातःकाल में इन्द्रधनुष पश्चिम दिशा में दिखाई देता हो तो वारुण (जलसम्बन्धी) नक्षत्रों के द्वारा शीघ्र ही वर्षा होती है।

 ५१–नीले रंग वाले बादलों में सूर्य के चारों ओर परिधि (कुण्डलना) हो और दिन में ईशानकोण के अन्दर बिजली होती हो तो अतिवृष्टि होती है।

 ५२–सूर्य के उदय और अस्त के समय में लाल कुंडल, बिजली, सूर्य की परछाई, परिघ और इन्द्रधनुष दृष्टिगत हों तो शीघ्र ही अधिक वर्षा आती है।

 ५३–श्रावण के महीने में प्रातःकाल गर्जना हो और जल पर मछली का भ्रम होता हो तो अठारह प्रहर के पहले-पहले पृथ्वी जल पूरित हो जाती है।

 ५४–श्रावण में एक बार ही दक्षिण की प्रचंड हवा चले तो वारुणनक्षत्र आने पर वहाँ शीघ्र ही वर्षा होती है।

 ५५–पूर्व की हवा होने पर तमाम दिशायें यदि धूम्रवर्ण की हों तो चार प्रहर के अन्दर- अन्दर बादल तालाबों को भर देंगे।

 ५६–रात में गर्जना हो, दिन में लाल रंग वाली दण्डाकार बिजली चमकती हो और प्राची दिशामें शीतल हवा चलती हो तो शीघ्र वर्षा आती है।

 ५७–संध्या के समय में जो बादल पर्वताकार दिखाई देते हों वे सूर्य के अस्त होने पर आठ प्रहर वर्षा करते हैं।

 ५८–पूर्व दिशा में धूम्रवर्ण का बादल यदि सूर्यास्त होने पर काला होजाय और उत्तर में मेघमाला हो तो शीघ्र वर्षा करती हैं।

 ५९–प्रभात के समय में दिशायें निर्मल हों और मध्याह्न के समय गर्मी (धूप) पड़ती हो तो अर्द्ध-रात्रि के समय प्रजा के सन्तोष के लायक अच्छी वर्षा होती है।

 ६०–अत्यन्त वायु का चलना, सर्वथा ही वायु का न चलना, अत्यन्त गरमी का पड़ना, अत्यन्त शीत पड़ना, अत्यन्त बादलों का होना और सर्वथा ही बादलों का न होना ये छः प्रकार के मेघ के लक्षण कहे गये हैं।

 ६१–वायु का न चलना, बहुत वायु चलना और ऊष्मा (गरमी) के साथ चौतरफ़ी दवा का चलना, इन सब को पैदा करता हुआ तथा चारों ओर फैला हुआ बादल अवश्य वर्षा करता है

 ६२–वर्षाकाल के आरम्भ में दक्षिण दिशा के अन्दर यदि वायु, बादल अथवा बिजली चमकती हो तो अवश्य वर्षा होती है।

 ६३–शुक्रवार के निकले हुए बादल यदि शनिवार तक ठहरे रहैं तो वे बिना वर्षा किये कभी नष्ट नहीं होते हैं, अवश्य वर्षा करते हैं।

 ६४–उत्तर में बादलों का घटाटोप हो रहा हो और पूर्व से वायु चलती हो तो अवश्य वर्षों होती है, वे बादल बिना वर्षा किये कभी नहीं जाते हैं।

 ६५–अन्य किसी दिशा से लौट कर यदि वायु पूर्व से चलने लगे और वहां बादल भी छाये हुए हों तो अवश्य वृष्टि होगी।

 ६६–पूर्व में बिजली चमकती हो, वायव्य और पूर्व से वायु चलती हो और उत्कंठा के साथ चातक (पपीहा) पक्षी शब्द करता हो तो अचानक बहुवृष्टि होती है।

 ६७–यदि अनेक पुट (तह) वाले बादलों से सब आकाश ढका हुआ हो और हवा चारों ओर से रुकी हुई हो तो शीघ्र ही अधिक वर्षा होती है।

 ६८–अत्यन्त गरमी के कारण यदि घबराहट हो रही हो और वायु प्रतिकूल नहो तो शीघ्र ही चारों ओर वर्षा होती है।

 ६९–पूरी रातभर छाया हुआ मेघ प्रातःकाल यदि गर्जना करे और अत्यन्त ऊष्मा से व्याकुलता हो रही हो तो कई रात तक वर्षा होती है।

 ७०–यदि बादलों की बादलों से मुठभेड़ (टक्कर) होती हो तो दो-तीन प्रहर के बाद घटा टोप होगा।

 ७१–सायंकाल के समय अनेक तह वाले बादल यदि मोर, धनुष, जपा (लाल पुष्प) और तोते के तुल्य हों अथवा जल जन्तु, लहरों एवं पहाड़ों के तुल्य हों तो शीघ्र ही वर्षा आती है।

 ७२–पर्यन्त (कोर-छोर) के भागों में श्वेतवर्ण वाले, नीले, स्निग्ध (चिकने) और अनेक पुट (त) वाले बादल यदि पूर्व या पश्चिम को जाते हों तो शीघ्र ही बहुत वर्षा होती हैं।

 ७३–तीतर के पंखों की सी आभावाले विचित्र वर्ण के मेघ यदि उदय और अस्त के समय अथवा रात दिन दिखाई दें तो शीघ्र ही बहुत वर्षा होती है।

 ८०–जल विरस (दूसरे स्वाद का) हो जाय, मछलियाँ भूमि की ओर कूदने लगजायँ,

मेंढक बहुत ऊंचे स्वर से बोलने लगें तो शीघ्र ही वर्षा आती है।

 ८१–मार्जार (बिल्ली) यदि नखों से भूमि को बहुत खोदने लगे, लोह के जंग से दुर्गन्ध निकलती हो तो शीघ्र वर्षा आती है।

 ८२–पर्वत यदि काजल के समूह के समान वर्ण के हो जावें, कन्दराओं से वाष्प (भाफ़) निकलती हों अथवा गुद्दायें भाफ़ से रुकी हों तो शीघ्र वर्षा आती है।

 ८७–वृक्ष पर चढ़े हुये सर्पों का चीत्कार शब्द होता हो, मेंढकों की जोर की आवाज होती हो, तो तीन दिन में वहाँ मेघ निश्चय से गर्जता है।

 ८८–चिड़ियाँ मिट्टी में स्नान करें, टिट्टिभ (टटेरी) जल में स्नान करें चातक जोर से शब्द करे तो शीघ्र वर्षा आती है।

 ८९– घड़े में यदि मक्खन, अफीम, गुड़ अथवा लवण पिघलने लगे तो शीघ्र वर्षा आती है।

 ९०– बकरी यदि अधिक समय तक पवन की गति की ओर मुखकर के खड़ी रहे, और छोटे-छोटे साँप वृक्षों पर चढ़े हों तो शीघ्रही वर्षा होती है।

 ९१–छोटे पेडों की कलियाँ जल जायें, आकड़े आदि के पेड़ में कलियाँ निकल आवें, बड़ की शाखाओं में खोखले हो जावें तो शीघ्र वर्षा आती है।

 ९२–दाढ़ी, मूंछ, गीलीसी, चिकनी, और नरम होजायें, प्राणी गरमी से व्याकुल होवें तथा आलस्य, शिथिलता, निद्रा आने लगे तो अवश्य वर्षा आती है।

 ९३–गोबर में कीड़े पड़ जॉय, मौरों के पंखों में ‘भन-भन’ शब्द होने लगे, गिरगट लाल आभावाले होजायें तो अवश्य वर्षा आती है।

 ९४–यदि चातक, मोर, और सियार बहुत रोने लगें और आधी रात में मुरगों के शब्द हों तो शीघ्र ही वर्षा होती है।

 ९५–मक्खियों यदि बहुत फिरने लगें, भ्रमर अधिक घूमने लगें और वे गोबर की गोलियाँ बनाकर लेजाते हों तो निश्चय से वर्षा होती है।

 ९६–काँसी में जंग लगने लगे जल के जीव व्याकुल हो जावें, नालियों के जल उष्णता होजाय तो अवश्य वर्षा होती है।  
 ९७–थोर के पत्तों में यदि जहां तहां अंकुर निकल आयें तो उन्हें वर्षा कराने वाली हवा के बुलानेवाले जानना चाहिये।

 ९८–यदि वृक्ष, गुल्म, लतायें छिद्र रहित स्निग्ध पत्र वाली दिखाई देती हों तो चारों ओर से दोष रहित वर्षा कराने वाली वायु चलती है।

 ९९–पित्त की प्रकृति वाला मनुष्य यदि प्रगाढ़ (अत्यन्त) निद्रा में प्राप्त हुआ दिखाई दे तो वृष्टि कारक वायु का आगमन जानना।

 १००–वात-पित्त प्रधान मनुष्य का शिर यदि अधिक घूमने लगे तो वृष्टि कारक वायु का आगमन जानना चाहिये।

 १०१–कागज पर कलम लगाते ही यदि स्याही फैल जाती हो और कठिनता से वह सूखती हो तो वृष्टि करने वाली वायु का आगमन समझो।

![](../books_images/U-IMG-1730100268Screenshot2023-05-17160630.png)१०२–उल्का गिरना, दिशाओं का दाह होना, निर्घात का होना, रज की वृष्टि होना, इन्द्र धनुष तथा ग्रहों का युद्ध होना ये छः वर्षा के नाश के योग हैं।

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

![](../books_images/U-IMG-1730100268Screenshot2023-05-17160630.png)यहाँ उल्का शब्द उपलक्षण समझना चाहिये। इससे धिष्णया और तारा का भी ग्रहण कर लेना चाहिये।

 उल्कापात औग्र धिष्ण्या पात में आकाश के अन्दर प्रकाश होता है, किन्तु उल्का में तो प्रकाश शनैः

 १०३–नैर्ऋत्य कोण वा पश्चिम की हवा हो, जल की नालियों के जल शीतल और निर्मल हो जायँ तो वहाँ दस दिन तक वर्षा नहीं होगी।

 (नोट–वृष्टि परीक्षा के लिए लोहे के नलों में जल भरलेना चाहिए। फिर १२ घंटे बाद इसकी परीक्षा करनी चाहिए।)

 १०४–प्रातःकाल बादलों का घटाटोप होना मध्याह्न में सूर्य का प्रचन्डता से तपना, सायंकाल ठंडी वायु का चलना और रात्रि में तारा निकलना ये लक्षण वर्षा के नाशक हैं।

 १०५–दिन में बादलों का घटाटोप हुआ रहना और रात्रि में स्वच्छ आकाश का होना दुर्भिक्ष का लक्षण है, ऐसी दशा में मेघ नहीं बरसता है।

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––

शनैः बढ़ता है और धिण्ष्यया में एकदम प्रकाश होकर क्रमशः चीया होता जाता है। तारा टूटने में प्रकाश नहीं होता बल्कि प्रकाश में एक सीधी सी पतली तथा चमकीली रेखा होकर वहीं तत्काल नष्ट हो जाती है ! उसका धिष्ण्या और तारा ये तीनों ही नियत दिशाओं में बढ़ने वाली हवाओं के परस्पर संघर्ष से पैदा होते हैं।

 दिग्दाह या दिशा दाह उसे कहते हैं कि जब कभी आकाश का वर्ण लालसा होजाय और गर्मी बढ़जाय तो सायंकाल के समय पश्चिम क्षितिजपर और प्रातःकाल पूर्व क्षितिज में यह दिग्दाह होता है, अन्य समयों में अन्यत्र नहीं होता।

 दिशाओं की नियत बायु के कारण वर्षा के गर्भ (जिनका वर्णन पहले आध्याय में हो चुका है) आपस मैं भिड़-भिड़ कर नष्ट हो जाते हैं और इससे एक भयंकर शब्द पैदा होता है-यही निर्घात’ कहलाता है।

 आकाश में कभी-कभी धूल ही धूल छाई हुई दिखाई देती है और आकाश रज से अच्छादित होजाता है इसे 'रजोवृष्टि' कहते हैं।

 आकाश में सफ़ेद बादल हो रहे हों और थोड़ी देर में इन्द्रधनुष हो जाय तो वह मेघ का विघातक है आकाश में जल के विरल पड़जाने पर इन्द्रधनुष होता है। अग्नि की विशेषता से जल विरल होता है और सोमवल की विशेषता से जल घन हो जाता है। जल के विरल होने से ही इन्द्रधनुष होता है जो उक् समय में होने से मेघ विघातक होता है।

 ग्रहयुद्ध से यह नहीं समझना चाहिये कि ग्रह गण आपस में लड़ाई करते हैं, इसका अभिप्राय यह है कि एक रेखा पर जब एक से अधिक ग्रह आ जाते हैं तब ग्रह की ग्रह के साथ युति होती है, इससे ग्रहों की किरणों का आपस में घर्षण होजाता है, बस इसी घर्षण का नाम ग्रह युद्ध है। इस युद्ध से वायु में एक प्रकार की इल चल उत्पन्न होजाती है, जिससे आकाश में छाये हुये मेघ तीन-तेरह होजाते हैंI

 १०६–उत्तर दिशा में अच्छी बादलों की घटा छायी भी रहै, किन्तु यदि दक्षिण की हवा चल जाय तो वह घटा बिना वर्षा किये ही नष्ट हो जाती है।

 १०७–वर्षा की झड़ी लग रही हो और पश्चिम की वायु तथा इन्द्रधनुष हो जाये तो तत्काल ही वह वृष्टि नष्ट हो जाती है।

 १०८–आर्द्रा, भरणी रोहिणी, तीनों उत्तरा (उत्तराषाढ़, उत्तरफाल्गुनी, उत्तरभाद्रपद) और मघा इन नक्षत्रों में जब तक मंगल रहे तब तक वर्षा नहीं होती।

 १०९–रोहिणी जब तक दुष्ट ग्रहों (शनि, मंगल सूर्य) से युक्त रहै, सूर्य जब तक रूक्ष रहे तथा जब तक वर्षा के विघातक दुर्योग रहें तब तक वर्षा नहीं आती।

 ११०–जब तक मेघ सर्पाकार रहे, जब तक सूर्य चन्द्र की तरह रहे अर्थात् तेजो रहित धूप हो और जब तक नैऋत्य कोण की बायु रहे तब तक वर्षा नहीं होती।

 १११–जब प्रातःकाल घास के अग्रभाग में मोती की तरह ओस की बूंदें चमकने लग जायें और ठंडी हवा चलने लगजाय तो वर्षा काल की समाप्ती समझलेनी चाहिए।

 १–पलों के स्वामी–शनि, बुध सूर्य, बृहस्पति, चन्द्रमा, शुक्र और मंगल होते हैं। होरा के स्वामी–शनि,बृहस्पति, मंगल, सूर्य, शुक्र, बुध और चन्द्रमा होते हैं।

 २–वारों के स्वामी शनि, सूर्य, चन्द्रमा, मंगल, बुध, वृहस्पति और शुक्र होते हैं। महीनों के स्वामी चन्द्रमा, बुध, शुक्र, रवि, मंगल, वृहस्पति और शनि होते है।

 ३–वर्ष के पति–शनि, मंगल, शुक्र, चन्द्रमा, वृहस्पति, सूर्य और बुध होते हैं। मेष की संक्रान्ति के दिन मंगल के अतिरिक्त अन्य वारेश होने चाहिए।

 ४–चन्द्रमा, बुध और शुक्र ये तीनों अन्तर्ग्रह हैं। मंगल, बृहस्पति और शनि ये तीनों बहिर्ग्रह कहलाते हैं।

 ५–वृहस्पति, शुक्र, चन्द्रमा और बुध ये शुभग्रह हैं। शनि मंगल और सूर्य ये क्रूर ग्रह हैं।

 ६–बृहस्पति, शनि शुक्र चन्द्रमा ये चारों आर्द्र (गीले) ग्रह कहलाते हैं। बुध, सूर्य, और मंगल ये तीन शुष्क (सूखे) ग्रह कहलाते हैं।

 ७–मंगल और शनि ये दोनों रूक्ष (रूखी प्रकृति के) ग्रह हैं। वृहस्पति, शुक्र, और सूर्य ये तीन स्निग्ध (चिकनी प्रकृति के) ग्रह हैं। चन्द्रमा और बुध ये द्विधर्मी (स्निग्ध और रूक्ष मह कहलाते हैं ये जिसके साथ हों अथवा जिसे देखते हों उसके अनुगामी होते हैं

 ८–बुध शनि शुक्र और चन्द्रमा ये चार शीत (ठंडी प्रकृति के) ग्रह हैं, मंगल और सूर्य ये दोनों ऊष्मा (गरम स्वभाव के) ग्रह हैं, तथा वृहस्पति शीतोष्ण (सरद गरम स्वभाव के) ग्रह हैं।

 ९–शनि, बृहस्पति और बुध ये तीन बायु प्रकृति के ग्रह है, मंगल शोष प्रकृति का (सुखाने वाला) ग्रह है। अवशिष्ट सूर्य, चन्द्रमा, शुक्र ये तीनों स्नेह स्वभाव वाले ग्रह हैं।

 १०–बृहस्पति, मंगल, सूर्य ये तीन पुं ग्रह (पुल्लिंग) कहलाते हैं। चन्द्रमा शुक्र ये दोनो स्त्री ग्रह कहलाते हैं। शनि और बुध नपुंसक यह हैं। यह कल्पना उष्णता और शैत्य आदि गुणों के कारण की गई है।

 ११–शुक्र हमेशा स्वभाव से ही वृष्टि करता है, किसी निमित्त के होने पर वृष्टि रोकता है। किन्तु मंगल सदा स्वभाव से ही वृष्टि विघातक है, किसी निमित्त के आने पर ही वर्षा करता है।

 १२–वर्षा काल के आरम्भ में अर्थात् वर्षा के लिये शुक्र और मंगल की ही परीक्षा करनी चाहिये, क्योंकि इन्हीं दो के आधीन वर्षा का आना है, अन्य ग्रह तो इनके सहायक हैं।

 १३–स्वभाव से ही बुध और शनि वायु पैदा करते हैं, शुक्र और बृहस्पति जल पैदा करते हैं, मंगल और सूर्य गरमी पैदा करते है।

 १४–शनि के योग से पूर्व को वायु चलती है, गुरू के योग से पूर्व उत्तर को, मंगल के योग से पश्चिम को, और शुक्र के योग से दक्षिण दिशा को वायु चलती है।

 १५–शनि के योग से भारी, घन, ठंढी और रूखी हवा चलती है, शुक्र के योग से गीली और ठढी हवा चलती है, और मंगल के योग से रोग करने वाली हवा चलती है।

 १६–बृहस्पति न अधिक गरम न अधिक शीत अर्थात् साधारण आर्द्र (गोली) वायु चलाता है। चन्द्रमा और बुध ये दोनों संयुक्त और दृष्ट ग्रहों के अनुसार से वायु चलाते हैं।

 १७–शनैश्चर अभ्र और प्रचंड वायु को पैदा करता है। शुक्र शीत ऋतु में विन्दुपात करता है और ग्रीष्म ऋतु में गरमी पैदा करता है।

 १८–मंगल उल्कापात, बिजली, गर्जना आदि उत्पात पैदा करता है। वृहस्पति सब को प्रसन्न करने वाली ऋतु पैदा करता है।

 १९–चन्द्रमा जिस-जिस ग्रह के साथ हो जाता है उसी उसी के स्वभाव के अनुसार फल दिया करता है।

 २०–^(१)वर्ण, ^(२)अयन (दक्षिणायन और उत्तरायण ) की गति, ^(३)वक्रगति, ^(४)उदय, ^(५)अस्त, ^(६)मण्डल, ^(७)राशि और ^(८)नक्षत्र इन आठों के अनुसार ग्रह का फल वर्णन किया जाता है।

 २१–मंगल अयन काल में, बुध संक्रान्ति काल में, बृहस्पति उदय के समय में, शुक्र अस्त होने के समय में और शनैश्चर तीनों (संक्रमण तथा उदय अस्त) कालों में वर्षा करता है।

 २२–बुध और शुक्र ये दोनों हीं उदय एवं अस्त होते हुए वर्षा करते हैं। शुक्र के उदय होने पर अस्त हुए सभी ग्रह खूब वर्षा करते हैं।

 २३–उदय तथा अस्त होते हुए ग्रह को गुरु यदि पूर्ण, अथवा चतुर्थांश कम दृष्टि से देखे तो वह ग्रह वर्षा करता है अन्यथा नहीं।

 २४–उदय और के चयन में, संक्रमण में, वक्र और सरल गति के समय [जलनाड़ी](" जलनाडी  का विवरण आगे सप्तनाडी चक्र में देखना चाहिये।") में गए हुए सब ग्रह वृष्टि का रक होते हैं।

 २५–आर्द्रादि नक्षत्रों पर सूर्य के जाने से प्रायः वृष्टि होती है, तथा इसी प्रकार ग्रहों के उदय, अस्त, संगम और मण्डलान्तर में जाने के समय प्रायः वर्षा होती है।

 २६–शुक्र और शनि का एक राशि पर अस्त होना अत्यन्त दुःख दाता है। वक्र गति के समाप्त होने पर क्रूर ग्रह शुभ होजाता है। बृहस्पति वक्रगति की दशा में भी शुभ ही होता है।

 २७–अतिचार (तेज चाल) में प्राप्त हुए क्रूर ग्रह अल्प वर्षा करते हैं, किन्तु शुभ ग्रहों के अतिचार में प्राप्त होने से वर्षा होती है।

 २८–क्रूर ग्रहों के वक्री होने से अवर्षा होती है और शुभ ग्रहों के वक्री होने से वृष्टि होती है। क्रूर ग्रह वक्र होजायें और सौम्यग्रह का अतिचार होजावे तो घोर अवर्षा होती है।

 २९–बृहस्पति के अतिचार होने (तेज चलने) पर और शनि के वक्री होने पर अत्यन्त अनावृष्टि के कारण सब जगह पृथ्वी सूख जाती है।

 ३०–वक्री होकर बुध यदि शुक्र को छोड़ दे तो ५ या ७ दिन वर्षा होती है।

 ३१–इस तरह साधारण वैकारिक भाव कहे गये हैं। विशेषकर प्रत्येक ग्रह के वैकारिक भाव अब आगे कहे जाते हैं।

 ३२–आकाश में शनिग्रह यदि बड़े आकार का, विमल, स्निग्ध, नीलमणि की प्रभा वाला और बाण तथा अलसी के पुष्प की सी आभावाला दिखाई देता होतो शुभ है। रूक्ष हो तो अशुभ है।

 ३३–शनि का दक्षिण की तरफ़ उदय होना दुर्भिक्षकारी है और उत्तर की तरफ उदय सुभिक्षकारी होता है। किन्तु यदि यह कृत्तिका वा रोहिणी नक्षत्र के उत्तर में हो तोभी अशुभ दी होता है।

 ३४–शनिश्चर यदि नक्षत्रों के दाहिनी ओर चलता है तो सुभिक्ष करता है, बाई ओर जाता है तो दुर्भिक्ष करता है।

 ३५–हस्त, स्वाती, भरणी, आर्द्रा, श्रवण, पूर्व फल्गुनी इन नक्षत्रों में चलता हुआ शनि शीघ्र वर्षा करता है।

 ३६–अश्लेषा, शतभिषा, ज्येष्ठा इन नक्षत्रों पर चलता हुआ शनि अल्पवृष्टि करता है। मूल, रेवती और उत्तरभाद्रपद इनमें चलता हुआ घोर अवृष्टि करता है।

 ३७–चित्रा, विशाखा, अनुराधा, पूर्वाषाढ़, धनिष्ठा, पुनर्वसु, मघा और पुष्य इनमें जाने से शनि वृष्टि को रोकता है।

 ३८–मूल और श्रवण में साधारण वर्षा होती है। मृगशिर और चित्रा में सुवृष्टि होती है। भाद्रपद, हस्त, पुष्य और वरुण नक्षत्र में मंदवृष्टि होती है।

 ३९–मघा, अश्लेषा, कृत्तिका, रेवती नक्षत्रों में शनि के प्रविष्ट होने पर अनावृष्टि होती है। विशाखा में प्रविष्ट होने पर पहिले तो वर्षा और बाद में अवर्षा होती है।

 ४०–रुद्रयामल नाम के ग्रंथ का मत है कि भरणी और श्रवण नक्षत्र में शनि के आने पर वर्षा नहीं होती है।

 ४१–घनिष्ठा नक्षत्र में यदि मंगल, शनि और शुक्र स्थित हों तो गर्जना करते हुए भी बादल वर्षा नहीं करते हैं।

 ४२–धनिष्ठा नक्षत्र में शनि यदि केवल मंगल से ही युक्त होजाय, तब भी वर्षा नहीं होती है और धान्य की हानि होती है।

४३–[पूर्वाषाढ़](" किसी-किसी ग्रन्थ में पूर्वफाल्गुनी नहीं लिया है केवल पूर्वाषाढ़ हो लिया है।") नक्षत्र या पूर्वफाल्गुनी पर शनि हो और पुनर्वसु नक्षत्र पर सूर्य होतो जल का नाश होता है और प्रजा को दुःख होता है।

 ४४–धनु, मीन, कन्या, मिथुन और वृषराशि में स्थित शनि दुष्ट कहलाता है। इसी तरह तुला और वृश्चिक में भी स्थित शनि अतिदुष्ट होता है।

 ४५–शनि के मकर और कुंभराशि पर रहने से सुभिक्ष, मीन पर रहने से सर्वप्रजा का नाश, मेष राशि पर रहने से गुजरात में और वृष पर रहने से प्रभास देश में पीड़ा प्राप्त होती है।

 किन २ राशियों पर आया हुआ शनि, कौन-कौन से देशों को हानिकारक है यह आगे बताते हैं।

 ४६–शनि के मिथुन राशि पर आने से मरुस्थल में, कर्क पर आने से काश्मीर प्रान्त में,

सिंह राशि पर आने से इन्द्रप्रस्थ (दिल्ली) में, कन्या राशि पर आने से मालवा देश में पीड़ा होती है।

 ४७–शनि जब तुला, वृश्चिक और धन राशि पर जाता है तब अनावृष्टि करता है और भूमण्डल को दुर्भिक्ष से पीड़ित कर देता है।

 ४८–मकर राशि पर शनि के आ जाने से अन्तर्वेद(गङ्गा यमुना के मध्य का) देश विन्ध्याद्रि, नर्मदा तट पीडित होते हैं। कुम्भ पर शनि के आने सेपश्चिम देश तथा गोदावरी के तटवर्ती देश पीड़ित होते हैं।

 ४९–मीन राशि पर शनि के आने से सभी देश पीड़ित होते हैं, मेष राशि पर आने से यमुना तट और वृष तथा मिथुन पर आने से गोदावरी नदी का तीर पीड़ित होता है।

 ५०–कर्क राशि पर शनि के आने से बङ्ग देश, सिंह पर आने से कान्यकुब्ज (कन्नौज) देश, कन्या राशि पर आने से म्लेच्छ देश और तुला राशि पर आने से उत्तरापथ पीड़ित होते हैं।

 ५१–वृश्चिक पर तथा धनु पर शनि आने से पूर्व देश को वा कान्यकुब्ज देश को पीड़ा होती है। यह सब मत रुद्रयामल नामक ग्रन्थ का है।

५२–[पूर्व]("पूर्व द्वार परिभाषा नक्षत्र ये हैं- कृत्तिका, रोहिणी, मृगशिर, आर्द्रा, पुनर्वसु, पुष्य और अश्लेषा ।") द्वार नक्षत्रों में वक्री होकर शनि वर्षा नहीं करता है। इसी तरह मीन और कन्या में वक्री होकर शनि दुर्भिक्ष करता है।

 ५३–तुल और मीन राशि में अस्त होने पर शनि की वर्षा करता है। मिथुन, कर्क, सिंह, कन्या, मकर और वृश्चिक में अस्त हुआ शनि अवृष्टि करता है।

 ५४–मिथुन राशि पर अस्त हुआ शनि सब जगह अच्छी वर्षा करता है, वृश्चिक राशि पर अस्त हुआ अल्पवर्षा और मकर राशि पर अस्त हुआ शनि अवृष्टि करता है।

 ५५–किसी का मत है कि मीन पर अस्त हुआ शनि अच्छी वर्षा करता है, दूसरे लोग कहते हैं कि मीन राशि पर शनि के कारण वृष्टि की कमी से वायव्य आदि कोणों में कहीं वर्षा होजाती है।

 ५६–मिथुन और मेष राशि पर उदय हुआ शनि वर्षा करता है और कर्क तथा तुला राशि पर उदय होने से अनावृष्टि करता है।

 ५७–सब मण्डलों में संक्रमण करते हुए ग्रहों को जहाँ बृहस्पति पूर्ण दृष्टि अथवा एक पाद कम दृष्टि से देखता है, वहाँ वर्षा होती है।

 ५८–शुभ किरणों से जटिल, कुन्द पुष्प और स्फटिक मणि की सी प्रभावाला, अच्छे मार्ग पर जाता हुआ तथा अन्य ग्रहों से अहत (युति-रहित) बृहस्पति शुभ होता है।

 ५९–धूआँ के रंग वाला बृहस्पति अनावृष्टि करता है। इसी तरह काले वर्ण आदि विकार को प्राप्त हुआ भी बृहस्पति शुभ नहीं है।

 ६०–नक्षत्रों के उत्तर की तरफ़ हो तो बृहस्पति क्षेम और आरोग्य प्रदान करता है, दक्षिण की तरफ़ हो तो अनिष्ट कारक हैं तथा मध्य में होतो मध्यम फल देता है।

 ६१–बृहस्पति यदि रोहिणी के तारा को आच्छादित करके और शकट पर (रोहिणी ताराओं का समूह शकटाकार होता है) आरूढ़ होकर जावै तो वह प्रजा पीड़ा आदि क्लेशों से अत्यन्त अनर्थकारी होता है।

 ६२–६३–कृतिका नक्षत्र से गणना करते हुए सब (२७) नक्षत्रों का दो दो का चक्र (थोक) कर लेना चाहिये। इस विभाग में पाँचवें ग्यारहवें और बारहवें नक्षत्र का तीन तीन का थोक करना चाहिये। इस प्रकार २७ नक्षत्र १२ चक्र में बँट जाते हैं। जिस भाग में जिस नक्षत्र से उपलक्षित बृहस्पति का उदय हो वहीं से उस वक्त में आये नक्षत्र से उपलक्षित मास से शुरू करके गुरू की गति के अनुसार उन-उन नामों के बारह वर्ष कायम करले ने चाहिये जैसे कृत्तिका में कार्त्तिक, पुष्य में पौष इत्यादि। नक्षत्रों का विभाग निम्नलिखित क्रम से समझना चाहिये।

 ![](../books_images/U-IMG-1729160935r3.png)

 ६४–इस उपर्युक्त चक्र के क्रम से गुरू का उदय कार्त्तिक के नक्षत्रों में हो तो कार्त्तिक नामके वर्ष में अग्नि के द्वारा नष्ट होकर मनुष्य भूखे मरें,मार्ग शीर्ष में उदय होने से उस नाम के वर्ष में अत्यल्प वर्षा और, पौष या माघ में गुरू के उदय होने से उन-उन वर्षो में सामान्यतः सुभिक्ष और सुवृष्टि होती है।

 ६५–फाल्गुन में उदय होने से उस नाम के वर्ष में कहीं वृष्टि कहीं वृद्धि और कहीं पर धान्य पैदा होता है। चैत्र में होने से उस वर्ष में मध्यम वर्षा होती है। वैशाख में होने से सब धान्य होते हैं।

 ६६–ज्येष्ठ में उदय होने से अनावृष्टि, आषाढ़ में उदय होने से धान्य तथा कहीं कही वर्षा, श्रावण में उदय होने से मध्य वर्षा तथा पूरा धान्य होकर पुनः नाश होता है।

 ६७–भाद्र में उदय होने से सुभिक्ष होता है, अतिवृष्टि से कहीं कहीं दुर्भिक्ष भी हो जाता है। आश्विन में गुरू के उदय से तो अच्छी वर्षा और सब तरह की धान्य समृद्धि होती हैं।

 ६८–मूल, मघा, रोहिणी और रेवती नक्षत्रों में उदय हुआ गुरु सुभिक्षकारी होता है तथा इन्हीं उपर्युक्त नक्षत्रों में शनि प्राप्त होवै तो वह भी निश्चय ही दुर्भिक्ष करता है।

 ६९–मकर, कुंभ और मेष राशि पर उदय हुआ बृहस्पति सुदृष्टि कारक होता है। कर्क, मीन और धनुष पर उदय हुआ अल्पवृष्टि तथा तुला पर उदय हुआ गुरू अनावृष्टि करता है।

 ७०–७२–बृहस्पति का उदय यदि माघ फाल्गुन में हो तो खण्डवर्षा, पौष में हो तो अच्छी वर्षां मार्गशीर्ष में हो तो अल्पवृष्टि, श्रावण में हो तो बहुवृष्टि, आश्विन में हो तो साधारण वर्षा ज्येष्ठ और कार्तिक में हो तो अवृष्टि, चैत्र में हो तो विचित्र वर्षा, वैशाख में होतो सुभिक्ष, तथा आषाढ़ और भाद्रपद में होती हानि होती है। यह गुरु के उदय का फल समझना चाहिये।

 ७३–मीन और कन्या राशि पर अस्त हुआ गुरू सुभिक्ष करता है और वृष राशि पर अस्त हुआ दुर्भिक्ष करता है। बृहस्पति जहाँ जब वक्री होता है तहाँ तब वह सुभिक्षकारक होता है।

 ७४–रेवती, आर्द्रा और मृगशिर इन तीनों नक्षत्रों पर स्थित बृहस्पति अनावृष्टि करता है। आषाढ़, फाल्गुनी, हस्त और मघा नक्षत्रों पर स्थित बृहस्पति सुवृष्टि करता है।

 ७५–७६–कई तो गुरुवार का अन्य ही फल कहते हैं। यथा—पूर्व फल्गुनी और श्रवण से तीसरे नक्षत्र पर तथा मूल आर्द्रा और अश्विनी नक्षत्र पर स्थित बृहस्पति अच्छी वर्षा करता है। कृत्तिका से तीसरे नक्षत्र पर तथा पुनर्वसु, अश्लेषा, मघा, विशाखा और अनुराधा नक्षत्र पर स्थित बृहस्पति मध्य वृष्टि करता है। इनके अतिरिक्त बचे हुए नक्षत्रों में स्थित बृहस्पति अनावृष्टि करता है।

 ७७–७८–कई ऋषियों का इस गुरुवार में और ही मत है। वह इस प्रकार है–गुरु के योग से भाद्रपदा, अश्लेषा, पुष्य और पुनर्वसु अनावृष्टि के लिये होते हैं। कृत्तिका, रोहिणी, विशाखा, अनुराधा, मध्यवृष्टि के लिये और मघा, फाल्गुनी, हस्त, मृगशिर, आर्द्रा ये नक्षत्र सुवृष्टि के लिये होते हैं।

 ७९–ज्येष्ठा और मूल में यदि वृहस्पति हो तो दो महीने तक वृष्टि होती है। पूर्वाषाढ़ उत्तराषाढ़ में बृहस्पति हो तो तीन महीने तक वृष्टि होती है। स्वाती, चित्रा के तृतीय और चतुर्थ चरण ( तुला ) में यदि बृहस्पति रहे तो खण्ड वृष्टि होती है उसके परे शुभ होता है।

 ८०–८१–बृहस्पति यदि एकादशी तिथि में सिंह, कन्या अथवा तुला राशि को प्राप्त हो तो अवश्य महावर्षा होती है, वृश्चिक या धनुष राशि को प्राप्त हो तो अल्पवर्षा और वृष, मिथुन तथा कर्क राशि को प्राप्त हो तो मध्यम वर्षा होती है। सिंह राशि में अतिवृष्टि और अवशिष्ट राशियों में गुरु के स्थित होने पर शुभ वर्षा होती है।

 ८२–किसी का मत है कि गुरु के सिंह राशि पर आने से अतिवृष्टि मीन पर आने से अनावृष्टि, धनुष पर आने से मध्यवृष्टि, कन्या और मेष पर आने से सुवर्षा और शेष राशियों में अल्पवर्षा होती है।

 ८३–बृहस्पति दिन में धन राशि पर प्रविष्ट होने से और रात्रि में मीन राशि पर प्रविष्ट होने से अधिक फल देता है। सिंह राशि के दशवें अंश पर और मेष राशि के बीसवें अंश पर दिन में प्रविष्ट होने से इसका फल नष्ट हो जाता है।

 ८५–कुटिल (टेढ़ा), कठोर, श्यामवर्ण का जलता हुआ सा धुआँ तथा शिखावाला विवर्ण और वाम मार्ग पर आश्रित मंगल अमंगल करता है।

 ८६–शिखावाला एवं धुआंसा दिखाई देने वाला मंगल पारियात्र पर्वत के प्रान्त देशों को और अपनी ['भक्ति]("मंगल की भक्ति के देशों के नाम आगे ")' में आए हुए देशों को नष्ट करता है।

 ८७–मघा, विशाखा और रोहिणी नक्षत्र को भेदन करता हुआ मंगल शुभ नहीं होता है। रोहिणी के दक्षिण चलता हुआ मंगल वर्षा को रोकता है।

 ८८–मंगल के उष्ण, अश्रुमुख, व्याल, रक्तास्य और असिमौसल ये पाँच मुख हैं; इनमें दूसरे और पाँचवें मुख से वर्षा नहीं होती है।

 ८९– मंगल के वक्री होने से वर्षा होती है। मकर राशि पर अस्त होने से वर्षा होती है तथा मिथुन पर अस्त होने से अल्प वर्षा होती है। अन्य राशियों पर अस्त होने से यह मंगल विशेष फल नहीं दिखाता है।

 ९०–मंगल का उदय यदि कुंभ में होतो अतिवृष्टि, धनुष पर हो तो वर्षा, मीन में होतो अनावृष्टि होती है \। मकर में मंगल का उदय होतो प्रारंभ में वर्षा होकर आगे वर्षा रुक जाती है।

 ९१–अश्विनी, रोहिणी, पुनर्वसु, मघा, विशाखा, मूल, श्रवण और पूर्वाभाद्रपद इन नक्षत्रों में मंगल का उदय होना शुभ है।

 ९२–अधिक मास में मंगल अथवा बृहस्पति एक राशि से दूसरी राशि पर प्रवेश करे तो महावृष्टि या लोक का नाश होता है।

 ९३–पूर्व फल्गुनी, पूर्वाषाढ़, पूर्व भाद्रपद, अश्विनी, हस्त, चित्रा स्वाती, अनुराधा और वारुण नक्षत्र में मंगल अच्छी वर्षा करता है।

 ९४–रोहिणी, श्रवण, ज्येष्ठा, मूल, मघा, आर्द्रा, भरणी और स्वाती इन नक्षत्रों में स्थित हुआ तथा तीनों उत्तरा (उ. फ. उ. पा., उ, भा.) में स्थित हुआ मंगल वर्षा नहीं करता है।

 ९५–कर्क राशि पर स्थित तथा शुभ ग्रहों से देखा हुआ मंगल अच्छी वर्षा करता है।

 ९६–यह मंगल मेष और वृश्चिक राशिपर दिन में आने से अपना विशेष प्रभाव दिखाता है तथा कर्क, मीन और वृश्चिक राशिपर आने से जल के विषय में विशेष शक्ति बनाता है।

 ९७–चमकते हुए बिम्बवाला निर्विकार, बडा और दधि के समान प्रभावाला तथा उत्तर के मार्ग में आश्रित एवं विजयी शुक्र होता है।

 ९८–जो शुक्र मंजीठ और सुवर्ण की आभावाला हो, घृत तथा चावल के माँड के समान वर्ण वाला तथा दही और चाँदी की प्रभावाला होतो वह अच्छी वर्षा करेगा।

 ९९–शुक्र यदि ताम्रवर्णं का हो, रूक्ष हो अथवा दिन में दीखता भी हो तो वह अनावृष्टि करता है। यह शुक्र वृष, कर्क और तुलाराशि पर वक्र होकर मार्गी होने पर अच्छी वर्षा करता है।

 १००–१०१–नाग, गज, ऐरावत, वृषभ, गो, जरद्गव, मृग, अज, वैश्वानर इन नौ वीथियों की उत्तर से दक्षिण की ओर अश्विन्यादि नक्षत्रमण्डल में कल्पना की गई है। इस तरह तीन नक्षत्रों के द्वारा नौ मार्ग बने हैं; क्योंकि नक्षत्र कुल २७ हैं।

 १०२–ऐरावत को सौम्य मार्ग, जरद्गव को मध्यमार्ग और वैश्वानर को याम्यमार्ग कहते हैं। अर्थात् उत्तर का मार्ग ऐरावत, मध्यका जरद्गव और दक्षिण का मार्ग वैश्वानरमार्ग है। इन तीन मार्गों के सोलह सोलह भाग हैं। ग्रह संस्था ४८ अंश के परिसर में स्थित है अतः १६ अंश के ३ मार्ग होने से ४८ अंश का परिसर समाप्त हो जाता है।

 १०३–सौम्य (उत्तर) वीथियों में शुक्र वर्षा धान्य आदि करता है और शुभ होता है। दक्षिण वीथियों में शक्र वर्षा धान्य आदि का नाश करता है।

 १०४–उत्तर की वीथियों में शुक्र उदय और अस्त होता हुआ शुभ होता है; मध्य वीथियों में मध्यफल देता है और दक्षिण की वीथियों में अनिष्ट करता है।

 १०५–वृश्चिक और धनराशि पर अस्त हुआ शुक्र अनावृष्टि करता है, मीनराशि पर प्रतिवृष्टि और मिथुन राशि पर सुवृष्टि करता है।

 १०६–वृष, कर्क, वृश्चिक और मीनराशि पर शुक्र के उदय होने से अधिक वर्षा होती है। तुला में अल्पवृष्टि और धन तथा कुंभ में उदय होने से अवृष्टि होती है।

 १०७–यह शुक्र आषाढ़ के महीने में उदय अस्त हुआ जल को सुखा डालता है, वर्षा नहीं होने देता है। किन्तु फाल्गुन या ज्येष्ठ में उदय हुआ शुक्र सुवृष्टि करता है।

 १०८–श्रावण में अस्त हुआ शुक्र दुःखप्रद होता है, भाद्र और आश्विन में अस्त हुआ शुभ होता है और कार्तिक तथा ज्येष्ठ में अस्त हुआ महावृष्टि करता है।

 १०९–फाल्गुन के महीने में अस्त हुआ शुक्र है महीने तक दुर्भिक्ष करता है।

 ११० –कार्तिक मास में अस्त हुए शुक्र का यदि कार्तिक में ही उदय होजाय तो ९० दिन पर्यन्त वर्षा नहीं होगी।

 १११–शुक्लपक्ष में शुक्र का अस्त और उदय होना वृष्टियोग का लक्षण है। तथा कृष्ण–पक्ष की अष्टमी, चतुर्दशी और अमावास्या में इसका उदय और अस्त होना सुवृष्टिकारक है।

 ११२–भरणी से चार नक्षत्र (मृगशिरा तक) एक मण्डल, आर्द्रा से चार नक्षत्र (अश्लेषा तक) दूसरा मण्डल, मघा से पाँच नक्षत्र (चित्रा तक) तीसरा मण्डल, स्वाति से तीन नक्षत्र (अनुराधा तक) चौथा मण्डल, ज्येष्ठा से पाँच नक्षत्र (श्रवण तक ) पाँचवाँ मण्डल और धनिष्ठा से छै नक्षत्र (अश्विनी तक) छठा मण्डल, इस तरह से प्रत्येक ग्रहों के ये छै मण्डल कहे गये हैं।

 ११३–द्वितीय मण्डल में शुक्र का वक्री, उदय और अस्त होना वृष्टिकारक होता है। तीन नक्षत्र वाले चौथे मण्डल में और छै नक्षत्र वाले छठे मण्डल में इसका वक्री उदय और अस्त होना शुभ है और अन्य मण्डलों में अशुभ है।

 ११४–मेघ, वायु, धर्म, रेतः (वीर्य) और सुवर्ण ये क्रम से छै द्वार माने गये हैं।

 ११५–मेघ के दोनों द्वारों में शुक्र के उदय होने से खूब जल बरसता है। वायु द्वार में उदय होने से आकाश में उन्नत हुए भी बादल वर्षा नहीं करते हैं।

 ११६–धर्मद्वार में सुत्रृष्टि रेतोद्वार में बादलों का नाश एवं हेमद्वार में वृष्टि और सुभिक्ष होता है।

 ११७–११८–भरणी से आठ नक्षत्र (अश्लेषा तक) मेघद्वार कहलाता है। इसमें शुक्र के उदय होने से वर्षा होती है। मघा से पाँच नक्षत्र (चित्रा तक) धूलिद्वार कहलाता है, इसमें जल का नाश होता है। स्वाती से सात नक्षत्र (उत्तराषाढ तक) राजद्वार कहलाता है, इसमें शुक्र का उदय अशुभ फल देता है और श्रवण से सात नक्षत्र (अश्विनी तक) कनकद्वार कहलाता है, इसमें शुक्र का उदय होना शुभ है। चक्र यह है :—

**द्वार परिज्ञापक चक्र।**

|  ८ अश्लेषा   |                |             |             |

 ११९–भरणी आदि नक्षत्रों पर चलनेवाला शुक्र सुवृष्टि करता है। इन आठों में भी भाद्र, पुनर्वसु, पुष्य और अश्लेषा में विशेष फल समझना चाहिये।

 १२०–भाद्रपद में भरणी, दोनों फल्गुनी, चित्रा, स्वाती, विशाखा, तथा मघा और कृत्तिका ये प्रत्येक नक्षत्र शुक्र के साथ योग होने से वर्षा करते हैं।

 १२१–ज्येष्ठा, मूल और पूर्व-उत्तर आषाढा तथा पुनर्वसु नक्षत्रों के बीच में से या मंगल सेहत हुए नक्षत्रों पर जानेवाला (मंगल जिन नक्षत्रों पर से गया हो उसी मार्ग से जाता हुआ) शुक्र अनावृष्टि करता है।

 १२२–अवर्षक (वर्षा न करने वाले) नक्षत्र में विचरता हुवा शुक्र यदि वर्षा करदे तो वर्ष (वर्षा करने वाले) नक्षत्र पर आया हुआ चन्द्रमा वर्षा नहीं करता है। जल नक्षत्र यह हैंः- हस्त, चित्रा, स्वाती, मूल, पू० षा; श्रवण, पूर्वाभा, रेवती, भरणी, तीनों उत्तरा और रोहिणी।

 १२३–वर्षाऋतु में पूर्वदिशा के अन्दर शुक्र यदि दिखाई दे तो नित्य थोड़ी-थोड़ी वर्षा होती है और यदि पश्चिम में दिखाई दे तो खूब जल बरसता है।

 १२४–स्वातीत्रय (स्वाति, विशाखा, अनुराधा) में पूर्व में उदय हुआ शुक्र और पितृ पंचक (मघा, पूर्व फल्गुनी, उत्तरफल्गुनी, हस्त, चित्रा) में पश्चिम में उदय हुआ शुक्र अनावृष्टि करता है। यदि उक्त नक्षत्रों में विपरीत (वक्री) होतो वर्षा करता है।

 १२५–मघादि पांच नक्षत्रों में यदि शुक्र पश्चिम में दिखाई देतो अनावृष्टि करता है। किन्तु इन्हीं नक्षत्रों में पूर्व दिशा में दिखाई देतो सुवृष्टि करता है।

 १२६–स्वाति आदि तीन (स्वाति, विशाखा, अनुराधा) नक्षत्रों में यदि शुक्र पश्चिम में दिखाई देतो सुवृष्टि होती है। पूर्व में यदि उक्त नक्षत्रों में दिखाई देतो दुःखदायिनी अनावृष्टि होती है।

 १२७–ज्येष्ठ और मूल पर रहते हुए शुक्र के पूर्व में दिखने से अनावृष्टि होती है। किसी का मत है कि हस्त और अनुराधा की स्थिति में अनावृष्टि होती है।

 १२८–मिथुन और कर्क में शुक्र के उदय से सदा हवा और वर्षा होती है। किसी का मत है कि कर्क के शुक्र में तालाब सूख जाते हैं और सिंह पर शुक्र के आने से मेघ तक का जल सूख जाता है।

 १२९–कुंभ राशि पर गया हुआ शुक्र खूब जल देता है अवशिष्ट राशियों पर गये हुए शुक्र का कोई विशेष फल निर्धारित नहीं किया जासकता।

 १३०–बड़ा, विशाल, स्वच्छ, स्निग्ध, सस्यक नामक मणि की आभावाला, शुक्र वा सुवर्ण के-से वर्णवाला और जिसके बिम्ब में से ज्योति निकलती हो ऐसा बुध शुभ होता है।

 १३१–यह बुध यदि अपनी प्राकृत (स्वाभाविक) गति (हालत) में रहे तो धान्य और क्षेमकुशल को प्रदान करता है, संक्षिप्त और मिश्र गति में मिश्र फल देता है और इनसे भिन्न गति में शुभ नहीं होता।

 १३२–कन्या राशि पर वक्री (उल्टी गति) हुआ बुध अवश्य सुभिक्ष करता है। वृष में उदय हुआ बुध अतिवृष्टि और मिथुन राशि पर उदय हुआ बुध अनाबृष्टि करता है।

 १३३–बुध का उदय उत्पातों से रहित नहीं होता, वह जल अग्नि और वायु के द्वारा भय उत्पन्न करता है और धान्य का नाश करता है।

 १३४–चन्द्रमा राशि में यदि चन्द्र, बुध और शुक्र का उदय होतो छः महीने तक दुर्भिक्ष रहे और अतिवृष्टि होय।

 १३५–आषाढ़ शुक्ला में बुध के उदय होने से जब तक वह अस्त नहीं होवे तब तक अनावृष्टि होती है। भाद्रपद में बुध के उदय होने से कल्याण होता है और आश्विन में बुधोदय से अशुभ होता है।

 १३६–आषाढ़ वा श्रावण में भी यदि बुध का उदय हो जाने पर शुक्र अस्त होजावे तो अनावृष्टि के द्वारा घास का दुर्भिक्ष कहना चाहिये।

 १३७–शुक्र के अस्त रहने पर श्रावण में यदि बुध का उदय होगा तो भाद्रपद के महीने में वर्षा नहीं होगी।

 १३८–उदय वा अस्त होता हुआ बुध यदि शुक्र के आगे रहे तो वह शीघ्र वर्षा पैदा करता है। यदि वह जलनाड़ियों में गया हुआ होगा तो अधिक वर्षा करेगा।

 १३९–पौष, माघ, वैशाख, आषाढ़ और श्रावण में बुध के दिखाई देने से अनावृष्टि और दुर्भिक्ष होता है। यदि वह उक्त मासों में न दीखे तो शुभ है।

 १४०–आश्विन और कार्तिक में बुध के दिखाई देने से शस्त्र, चोर, अग्नि, रोग, जल और क्षुधा से भय प्राप्त होता है।

 १४१–कर्क संक्रान्ति से दस दिन के अन्दर में बुध के उदय होने से श्रावण शुक्ला में अच्छी वर्षा होती है।

 १४२–इसी प्रकार सिंह की संक्रान्ति काल से दश दिन के अन्दर में जब बुध का उदय होता है तब अतिवृष्टि होती है।

 १४३–कर्क राशि पर बुध के अस्त होने से अनावृष्टि, सिंह पर अस्त होने से अल्पवृष्टि और कन्या पर अस्त होने से अतिवृष्टि होती है।

 १४४–रोहिणी से मघा तक के ७ नक्षत्रों एवं धनिष्ठा, श्रवण और उत्तराषाढ़ नक्षत्रों को भेदन करता हुआ बुध यदि जावे तो अनावृष्टि होती है।

 १४५–किसी का मत है कि तीनों पूर्वा नक्षत्रों में भेदन करने से भी अशुभ फल ही होता। हस्त आदि छः नक्षत्रों में विचरण करता हुआ यह सुभिक्ष और क्षेम करता है।

 १४६–अश्लेषा, स्वाती, कृत्तिका और मृगशीर्ष इन नक्षत्रों में बुध के आने पर क्रम से महावृष्टि और हवा चलती है।

 १४७–मिथुन तथा कन्या राशि पर बुध के आने से वायु सहित खूब वर्षा होती है। तुला पर आने से वर्षा और मेष तथा वृश्चिक राशिपर आने से मध्य वृष्टि होती है।

**इति बुधादेशाधिकरणम्।**

 १४८–समशृंग वाला, बड़े अङ्ग वाला, तुंग (ऊँचा), स्निग्ध तथा नागवीथी में विचरता हुआ और सौम्य ग्रहों से देखा हुआ एवं उनसे युक्त चन्द्रमा शुभ होता है।

 १४९–चन्द्रमा का शङ्क अथवा मल्ल यदि मङ्गल से निहत हो तो आमदनी का, बुध से निहत हो तो बाजार की दरों का, बृहस्पति से निहत हो तो वृष्टि का, शुक्र से निहत हो तो राजा का और शनि से निहित हो तो प्रजा का नाश करता है।

 १५०–कृत्तिका रोहिणी, मृगशिर, मघा, चित्रा और विशाखा से छः नक्षत्र तक के उत्तर में विचरता हुआ चन्द्रमा शुभ फल देता है।

 १५१–उपरि लिखित नक्षत्रों के दक्षिण मार्ग में चलता हुआ चन्द्रमा दुष्ट फल देता है। किन्तु अन्य अवशिष्ट नक्षत्रों के दक्षिण मार्ग में चलता हुआ भी यह अशुभ फल नहीं देता।

 १५२–तारक (तारा) ग्रह चन्द्रमा से दक्षिण मार्ग को जाते हुए शुभ फल देते हैं, तथा बृहस्पति और बुध के क्षेत्र में स्थित चन्द्रमा वर्षा ऋतु में वर्षा करता है।

 १५३–शुक्ल पक्ष की द्वितीया में सूर्य से बांई और चन्द्रोदय होने से सम्पूर्ण महीने तक शुभ होता है, किन्तु सूर्य से दाहिनी ओर चन्द्रमा का उदय होना अशुभ है।

 पहिले के प्रकरणों में तीन बहिग्रह और तीन अन्तर्ग्रहों का विवरण आचुका है अब इस प्रकरण में सूर्य और चन्द्रमा के योग से वृष्टि का विवरण लिखते हैं।

 १५४–पूर्वाषाढ, उत्तराषाढ़, श्रवण, धनिष्ठा, उत्तराभाद्रपद, रेवती, अश्विनी, भरणी, कृत्तिका, आर्द्रा, पुनर्वसु, पुष्य, अश्लेषा और मत्रा ये १४ नक्षत्र "चन्द्र नक्षत्र" कहलाते हैं।

 १५५–पूर्वाभाद्रपद, शतभिषा, मृगशीर्ष, रोहिणी, पूर्वा फाल्गुनी, उत्तरा फाल्गुनी, हस्त, चित्रा, स्वाती, विशाखा, अनुराधा, ज्येष्ठा, मूल ये १३ नक्षत्र 'सूर्यनक्षत्र' कहलाते हैं।

 १५६–यदि सूर्य चन्द्रनक्षत्रों में और चन्द्रमा सूर्यनक्षत्रों में हो तो वर्षा करता है।

 १५७–चन्द्रनक्षत्र में यदि सूर्य चन्द्रमा दोनों हों तो अल्पवृष्टि होती है, किन्तु यदि सूर्य नक्षत्र पर सूर्य चन्द्रमा दोनों हों तो वृष्टि नहीं होती।

 १५८–सूर्यनक्षत्र पर सूर्य के आने पर वायु तो चलती है, किन्तु वायु के दोष से वर्षा नहीं होती। चन्द्र के चन्द्र नक्षत्र पर रहने से छाया रहता है अर्थात् केवल बादल आच्छादित रहते हैं, किन्तु ऊष्मा की कमी के कारण वर्षा नहीं होती।

 १५९–चन्द्र नक्षत्र पर चन्द्रमा के होने पर वायु चलती और सूर्य नक्षत्र पर सूर्य के होने पर वर्षा नहीं होती। किन्तु चन्द्रमा और सूर्य के समायोग में सदा वर्षा होती है।

 १६०–सूर्य के उत्तरायण और दक्षिणायन के क्रम से मूलार्द्ध से शुरू कर मृगशिर नक्षत्र तक पुरुष नक्षत्र कहलाते हैं। आर्द्रा से दश नक्षत्र (चित्रा) तक स्त्री संज्ञक नक्षत्र और विशाखा से तीन नक्षत्र (ज्येष्ठा) तक नपुंसक कहे जाते हैं।

 १६१–जिस नक्षत्र पर गये हुए चन्द्रमा में सूर्य जिस नक्षत्र में प्रवेश करता है, कारण सूर्य नक्षत्र के भुक्ति काल के समय उसका फल कहना चाहिये।

 १६२–दो पुरुष नक्षत्रों के योग से छाया अर्थात् केवल बादलों का आच्छादित होजाना और नपुंसक नक्षत्रों के योग से कुछ नहीं होता। स्त्री और पुरुष नक्षत्र के योग से अच्छी वर्षा होती है, स्त्री और नपुंसक के योग से अल्प वृष्टि और शेष अन्य योगों में केवल वायु मात्र चल कर रह जाती है।

 १६३–किसी का मत है कि पुरुष नक्षत्र का योग होने पर ताप, नपुंसक में नपुंसक का

योग होने से महोष्णता (तेज गर्मी), स्त्री ही स्त्री का योग होने से महावायु और पुरुष स्त्री नक्षत्रके योग से वर्षा होती है।

 १६४–अन्य मत है कि नपुंसक नक्षत्र में वायु, स्त्री नक्षत्र में केवल बादलों के दर्शन और स्त्री नक्षत्रों के पुरुष नक्षत्र के योग से निश्चय वृष्टि होती है।

 १६५–रेवती, अश्विनी, मघा, पुष्य, श्रवण, स्वाती और मृगशिर इन नक्षत्रों में वा जल लग्न में चन्द्रमा के स्थित रहने पर नक्षत्र में प्रविष्ट होता हुआ सूर्य सुवृष्टि करता है।

 १६६–भरणी और कृत्तिका के चन्द्रमा में तथा विशाखा और अनुराधा के चन्द्रमा में सूर्य नक्षत्र का प्रवेश हो तो वृष्टि नहीं होती।

 १६७–सूर्य के नक्षत्र प्रवेश के समय केन्द्र, त्रिकोण में और जल नक्षत्र में चन्द्रमा के रहने पर तथा शुक्र से युक्त वा दृष्ट होने पर अच्छी वर्षा होता है।

 १६८–रात्रि में, अर्धरात्रि में वा जललग्न में अथवा अन्य वृष्टि योग में सूर्य के नक्षत्र–प्रवेश होने पर वृष्टि होती है।

 १६९–कर्क संक्रान्ति के दिन रविवार होने से १० बिस्वा, चन्द्रवार होने से २० बिस्वा, मंगलवार होने से ८ बिस्वा, बुधवार होने से १२ बिस्वा, गुरुवार होने से १८ बिस्वा, शुक्रवार होने से १८ बिस्वा और शनिवार होने से पाँच बिस्वा वर्षा होती है।

 १७०–कर्क संक्रान्ति के दिन शनि, रवि, बुध और मंगलवार होने से अधिक वृष्टि नहीं होती है, शेष वारों में सुवृष्टि होती है।

 १७१–चन्द्रमा के जलराशि पर स्थित रहने से यदि सूर्य कर्क राशि पर जायें तो अच्छी बर्षा होती है, इस तरह ज्योतिषी लोग कहते हैं।

 १७२–मेष, वृष, मिथुन और मीन राशि पर चन्द्रमा के रहते हुए यदि सूर्य कर्क राशि में प्रविष्ट होतो १०० आढक वर्षा होती है।

 १७३–१७४–कर्क संक्रान्ति के समय धनुष और सिंह राशि पर चन्द्रमा के होने से ५० आढ़क वर्षा, मकर और कन्या राशि पर चन्द्रमा के रहने से २५ आढक वर्षा और तुला, वृश्चिक, कुंभ वा कर्क राशि पर चन्द्रमा के रहने से १२॥ आढक वर्षा होती है अर्थात् अत्यन्त अल्प वर्षा होती है। इसमें से भी आधी वर्षा पहाड़ की चोटी पर उससे आधी वन में, उससे आधी ऊषर जमीन में और उससे भी अभी खेत में वर्षा समझनी चाहिये।

 जल की नाप इस प्रकार करें–एक हाथ (२४ अंगुल या १८ इंच) के व्यास का गोलाकार कुंड बना के मैदान में रखदे; फिर उसमें वर्षा का जल एकत्र हो उसे तौले कि कितने द्रोण, या आढक आदि वर्षा हुई।

 अनुमान ५ तोले (२ औंस) की १ पल, ५० पल की एक आढक ४ आढक का १ द्रोण होता है। यह द्रोण इस समय के २॥ इंच के अनुमान का है।

 यदि १ द्रोण जल बरसे तौ उस वर्ष का पानी साधारण भूमि में अनुमान ४ हाथ (९६ अंगुल या ६ फीट) तक नीचे पहुँचता है।

 १७५–कर्क राशि में प्रविष्ट होते सूर्य को यदि बृहस्पति पूर्ण दृष्टि अथवा एक पाद कम (पौन) दृष्टि से देखता हो तो अच्छी वर्षा होती है।

 १७६–श्रावण के महीने में यदि कर्क संक्रान्ति के समय मेघ खूब छाये हुए हों तो सात महीने तक सुभिक्ष होता है और अच्छी वर्षा होती है।

 १७७–मंगल के दिन कर्क संक्रान्ति का होना, शनिवार को मकर संक्रान्ति का होना और १५ मुहूर्त्तरिक्त तिथि का होना शुभ नहीं है।

 १७८–स्वाती, ज्येष्ठा, भरणी, आर्द्रा, अश्लेषा, शतभिषा इन नक्षत्रों में वा पन्द्रह (१५) मुहूर्त में मकर राशि या सूर्य के प्रविष्ट होने से अशुभ फल होता है।

 १७९–पुनर्वसु, विशाखा, रोहिणी और तीनों उत्तरा नक्षत्रों में अथवा चौथे पांचवें मुहूर्त्त में मकर राशि पर सूर्य का प्रविष्ट होना शुभ है।

 १८०–रवि-संक्रान्ति के दिन से ग्यारहवें, पचीसवें, चौथे, वा अठारहवें दिन अमावास्या का होना सुभिक्ष का सूचक है।

 १८१–पहली संक्रान्ति का नक्षत्र यदि दूसरी संक्रान्ति में आवै तो शुभ फल होता है। किन्तु उस नक्षत्र से दूसरे, तीसरे, चौथे, और पाँचवें नक्षत्र शुभ नहीं होते।

 १८२–यहाँ यह संक्रान्तिफल संक्षेप से कहा गया है, क्योंकि इसके पूर्व द्वादशमासिक प्रकरण के गर्भध्र्वाध्याय में प्रतिमास की संक्रान्ति का फल ठीक प्रकार से कह चुके हैं।

 ९८३–१८४–अनेक मार्गों में ऊपर ही ऊपर विचरते हुए ग्रहों के अत्यन्त दूर होने के कारण उनकी एक ही स्थान में स्थिति दिखाई देती है। अतः अंशसाम्य से हक सूत्र की समीपता के कारण प्रहयुति मानी जाती है। अर्थात् ऊपर और नीचे अनेक मार्गों पर विचरते हुए ग्रहों की किरण का परस्पर मेल होने से जो ग्रहों के बिम्ब में विकार पैदा होता है उसे ग्रहयुति वा ग्रहयुद्ध कहते हैं I यह ग्रहयुति अस्त, समागम और युद्ध इन भेदों से तीन प्रकार की होती है।

 १८५–किसी ग्रह का सूर्य से युति होना अस्त कहलाता है, चन्द्रमा से युति होना समागम कहलाता है और तारा ग्रहों की आपस में युति होना युद्ध वा समागम दोनों नामों से कहलाते हैं।

 १८६–देखने पर ग्रहों का यह युद्ध चार तरह से दिखाई देता है। भेद, उल्लेख, अंशुमर्द्द और अपसव्य।

 १८७–एक ग्रह के बिम्ब का दूसरे ग्रह के द्वारा ग्रास हो जावै सो भेद, बिम्ब के स्पर्श करने पर उल्लेख, अत्यन्त अल्प विम्ब के छिपने को अंशुमर्द्द और एक अंश पर आने को अपसव्य कहते हैं।

 १८८–संपात स्थान में प्राप्त ग्रहों की अपनी गति के वश से समीपता के कारण भेद उल्लेख आदि युद्ध के भेद हुआ करते हैं I

 १८९–इन दो ग्रहों के युद्ध में पराजित (हारा हुआ) वह ग्रह समझा जाता है जो दक्षिण, कंपयुक्त, रूखा, विवर्ण, विकृत, प्रभारहित, छिपा हुआ सा छोटा और उस ग्रह के पास न पहुँच कर ही बापस गया हुआ दिखाई देता हो।

 १९०–विजयी वह ग्रह होता है जो बड़ा, स्निग्ध, तेजस्वी, दक्षिण वा उत्तर की ओर हो। इन ग्रहों के युद्ध में शुक्र की प्रायः विजय ही होती है।

 १९१–यदि दोनों हीं ग्रह स्निग्ध, विपुल और प्रभावाले दिखाई देते हों तो उस ग्रह युति को समागम कहते हैं। विम्ब (मण्डल) का अंशों से अन्तरित होने पर सभी ग्रहों का समागम कहलाता है।

 १९२–युद्ध वा समागम यदि अपने लक्षणों से अव्यक्त (अप्रकट) हों तो उनके फल भी अव्यक्त ही रहते हैं, अर्थात् निश्चित रूप से उनके फल ज्ञात नहीं हो सकते हैं। यदि युद्ध वा समागम में से किसी का होना स्पष्ट रूप से निश्चित कर लिया जावे तो उनका फल भी पर्याप्त रूप से मिलता ही है।

 १९३–भेदयुद्ध होने पर अनावृष्टि और उल्लेखादि होने पर शस्त्र का भय होता है। युद्ध में जिस ग्रह की जय होवै उसी का फल कहा जाता है।

 १९४–बृहस्पति के द्वारा मंगल के हत होने पर बाह्रीक देशों को पीढ़ा पहुँचती है और बुध के द्वारा हत होने से साल्व, कलिङ्ग और शूरसेन देशों की हानि होती है।

 १९५–शुक्र के द्वारा मंगल के हत होने पर क्षत्रिय और म्लेच्छों की हानि होती है और शनि के द्वारा हत होने से तमाम प्रजा की हानि होती है। इसी प्रकार मंगल के द्वारा बुध के पराजित होजाने पर उत्तर में स्थित नदी तट के वृक्षों का नाश होजाता है।

 १९६–गुरु के द्वारा बुध के हत होने पर शूद्र, म्लेच्छ, पर्वतीय लोग और त्रैगर्त देश की हानि होती है और शुक्र के द्वारा हत होने से धान्य और मेघ का नाश होता है, तथा अग्नि का भय रहता है।

 १९७–१९८–शनि के द्वारा बुध के पराजित होने पर योद्धा लोगों और नाव चलाने वालों की हानि होती है। शुक्र के द्वारा वृहस्पति की हार होने पर, साल्व, वत्स, बंगाल, कैकय, भद्र, कुलूत और गान्धार देश तथा धान्य और गौ इनको पीड़ा पहुँचती है। मंगल के द्वारा वृहस्पति के हत होने से मध्य देश, गौ और राजा को पीड़ा पहुँचती है।

 १९९–बुध के द्वारा गुरु के हत होने से मध्य देश और म्लेच्छों का नाश होता है। और शनि के द्वारा गुरु के इस होने से विप्र देश, यौधायन देश का तथा अर्जुनायन देश का नाश होता है।

 २००–मंगल के द्वारा शुक्र की हार होने से युद्ध में सेनापति का नाश होता है और बुध के द्वारा हार होने से अल्प वृष्टि होती है और दूध कम होता है।

 २०१–शनि के द्वारा शुक्र की हार होने से जलजन्तुओं और गण के नेताओं का नाश होता है। गुरु के द्वारा भृगु की हार होने से अनावृष्टि होती है और कोशल देश का नाश होता है।

 २०२–२०३–मंगल के द्वारा शनि के हत होने पर, मध्यदेश, शूरसेन, मत्स्य, वंग और कलिङ्ग देशों का नाश होता है, बुध के द्वारा हत होने से काशी, बाह्लीक, ओड्र आन्ध्र और टंकण देशों का नाश होता है। गुरु के द्वारा हत होने से अंगदेश, वणिक, खेट और शक देश इनकी हानि होती है।

 २०४–हत हुए मंगल आदि ग्रहों का उपसंहार खास खास फल यह कहा गया है। तथा वे ग्रहभक्ति से हत हुए अपनी अपनो भक्ति के देशों को भी नष्ट करते है।

 २०५–देश भेद से ग्रहों के युद्ध का नेष्ट फल कह दिया गया है। अब इसके आगे पौर्वापर्य समागम का फल कहते है।

 २०६–२०७–प्रकरण के प्रारम्भ में पहिले सहयोगिता का अर्थ समझाते हैं। चक्राँश (गति स्थान) में या उदयाँश (उदय स्थान) में बैठे हुए दो ग्रहों की सहयोगिता होती है। इसी तरह दोनों ग्रहों का नक्षत्र एक हो या राशि एक दो तो वह भी सहयोगिता ही कही जाती है। इनमें मङ्गल, बुध और शुक्र के सात अंश और शनि, गुरु के नौ अंश हैं। चन्द्रमा के चक्रांश बारह माने गये हैं और सूर्य के चक्रांश पन्द्रह माने गये हैं।

 २०८–शनि के पन्द्रह १५ अंश, गुरु के ११ अंश, मङ्गल के १७ अंश और चन्द्रमा के १२ अंश माने गये हैं।

 २०९–२१०–शुक्र के कालांश९ होते हैं, वक्री होने पर इसके ८ अंश रहते हैं। इसी तरह इस शुक्र के उदयांश ९ होते हैं और वक्री होने पर ८ रह जाते हैं। बुध के १३ अंश होते हैं और वक्री होने पर इसके १२ रहते हैं।

 २११–चन्द्रमा की दैनिक भक्ति को नक्षत्र कहते हैं तेरह अंश बीस कला यह इसका मान कहा गया है।

 २१२–चन्द्र स्पष्ट की गणित से चन्द्रमा की दैनिक गति का मान यह है -१३ अंश, १० कला और ३५ विकला।

 २१३–चार, पाँच कला और १५ विकला यह अभिजित् मान कहा गया है, अथवा इसे अट्ठाईस नक्षत्र का मान समझना चाहिये।

 २१४–अश्विनी से प्रारम्भ करके रेवती के अन्त तक ३० अंश की राशि स्थिति मानी जाती है। क्रांति पात से जो तीस अंश की कल्पना की जाती है, वह यहाँ ठीक नहीं है।

 २१५–अपनी युति के अंश में ग्रह योग फत्त करते हैं, यह मत मेरा है। क्योंकि एक एक का युत्यंश युतिमान के कारण पृथक हो जाती है।

 २१६–वर्षाकाल में सूर्य से आगे मङ्गल के रहने पर अनावृष्टि, शुक्र के आगे रहने पर वर्षा, गुरु के आगे रहने पर गर्मी और बुध के आगे रहने पर वायु चलती है।

 २१७–सूर्य–मङ्गल, शनि- मङ्गल और गुरु-मङ्गल से वर्षा होती है। बुध-शुक्र और गुरु- बुध का योग अवश्य वर्षा करता है।

 २१८–क्रूर ग्रहों सेअदृष्ट और अयुत बुध और शुक्र एक राशि में स्थित हों और यदि उन्ह वृहस्पति भी देखता हो तो वे अधिक महावृष्टि के देने वाले होते हैं।

 २१९–क्रूर ग्रहों सेदृष्ट और अयुत (भिन्न) बुध और बृहस्पति एक राशि में स्थित हों अदृष्ट और अयुत बुध और शुक्र एक राशि में स्थित हों और यदि शुक्र उन्हें देखता हो तो वे अधिकतया अच्छी वर्षा करते हैं।

 २२०–क्रूर ग्रहों से दृष्ट और अयुत गुरु और भृगु एक जगह स्थित हों और बुध उन्हें देखता हो तो वे विशेष कर उत्तम वर्षा करते हैं।

 २२१–शुक्र और चन्द्रमा वा मङ्गल और चन्द्रमा यदि एक राशि पर स्थित हों तो सब दिशाएँ बन्धन-रहित हो जाती हैं और जल का योग पूर्ण होता है।

 २२२–सूर्य के सहित बृहस्पति यदि एक राशि पर प्राप्त हो जावै तो जब तक वह अस्त न हो तब तक वर्षा का योग समझना चाहिये। ये फल बुध और बृहस्पति के योग से भी समझना चाहिए।

 २२३–शनि और मङ्गल का एक राशि पर होना महावृष्टि का कारण समझना चाहिये। इस योग से दो महीने तक वर्षा होकर वह समाप्त होती है।

 २२४–सौम्य ग्रहों से अदृष्ट और अयुक्त शनि और मङ्गल यदि एक स्थान में स्थित हों तो वायु का प्रकोप और अग्नि का भय होता है।

 २२५–एक राशि वा एक ही नक्षत्र पर राहु और मङ्गल आजावैं तो ये दोनों वर्षा का नाश करते हैं। गुरु और शुक्र यदि एकत्र स्थित हों तो असमय में वर्षा होगी।

 २२६–सूर्य के आगे शुक्र वा बुध जावै तो वर्षा काल में निरन्तर वर्षा होती रहती है।

 २२७–मङ्गल के आगे सूर्य की गति होतो वह वर्षा को नहीं रोकता, किन्तु यदि सूर्य के आगे मङ्गल हो तो वह वर्षा को तत्काल रोक देता है।

 ३१२–एक नाडी एर शुक्र, सूर्य, बुध आजावै तो अनावृष्टि कहनी चाहिये। चारों ओर से जल सूख जाता है।

 ३१३–एक नाडी पर आये हुए राहु-मंगल अग्निपात करते हैं और शनि-मंगल युद्ध करते है।

 ३१४–शनि, मंगल और बृहस्पति यदि आर्द्रा वा मृगशिर नक्षत्र पर आजावै तो कंभ और मीनलग्न में बिजली के सहित वर्षा होती है।

 ३१५–केतु और मंगल के साथ होने पर चन्द्रमा अग्नि का भय करता है गुरु और भृगु के साथ होकर चन्द्रमा जल करता है, तथा सूर्य और शनि के साथ होकर चन्द्रमापात का भय करता है।

 ३१६–जो चन्द्रमा से बाई ओर पाँचवे, तीसरे, बाहरवें सातवें नवें छठे और पहिले स्थान में स्थित है वह भी युक्त ही माना गया है।

 ३१७–सूर्य, चन्द्रमा, शनि और राहु ये जब एक नाड़ी पर आरूढ हों तब दुर्दिन समझना चाहिये– अर्थात् चारों ओर आकाश मेघों से आच्छादित रहता है।

 ३१८–शनि, बृहस्पति, मंगल, सूर्य, शुक्र, बुध और चन्द्रमा इनकी क्रम से चण्डा, समीरा, दहना, सौम्या, नीरा, जला और अमृता ये नाडियाँ समझनी चाहिये।

 ३१९–३२१–कृत्तिका से प्रारंभ कर के (अभिजित् के सहित) २८ नक्षत्रों को उपरिलिखित सात नाडियों में ४ बार घुमाकर के विभक्त कर देना चाहिये। इस चक्र में नक्षत्रों का यह क्रम रखना चाहिये-कृतिका से अनुराधा तक सरलक्रम से और मघा से घनिष्ठा तक विपरीत क्रम से नक्षत्रों को लिखें। सात नाडियों के मध्य में सौम्यनाडी रैहेगी और इसके आगे पीछे तीन-तीन नाडियाँ। दक्षिण दिशा में गई हुई नाडियाँ क्रूर कहलायेंगी और उत्तर दिशा में गई हुई सौम्य कहलायेंगी, मध्य में रहने वाली मध्यनाडी कहलायेंगी। ये ग्रहयोग से फल देती हैं। कोष्ठों में यह चक्र इस प्रकार होगा–

**सप्तनाडीचक्र—**

![](../books_images/U-IMG-1729259599q1.png)  

नोटः— किसी ग्रंथ का मत है क़ि समीरा नाडी का स्वामी सूर्य है और सौम्य नाडी का स्वामी गुरु है।

 ३२२–अब प्रत्येक नाड़ी का फल कहते हैं–चण्डनाड़ी में दो-तीन से अधिक स्थित हुए ग्रह प्रचण्ड हवा चलाते हैं। समीर (वायु) नाड़ी में स्थित होने पर वायु और दहननाड़ी पर स्थित होने से ऊष्मा पैदा करते हैं।

 ३२३–सौम्यनाड़ी में स्थित होने से समता करते हैं, नीरा नाड़ी में स्थित होने पर मेघों का संचय करते हैं, जलनाड़ी में प्रविष्ट होने से वर्षा करते हैं तथा वे ही दो तीन से अधिक एकत्रित हुए ग्रह अमृतनाड़ी में स्थित होने पर अतिवृष्टि करते हैं।

 ३२४–अपनी नाड़ी में स्थित हुआ एक भी ग्रह उस नाड़ी का फल दे देता है। किन्तु मंगल सभी नाड़ियों में स्थित नाड़ी के अनुसार ही फल देता है।

 ३२५–सूर्य के चन्द्रादि हस्तान्त नक्षत्रमण्डल में स्थित होने पर ग्रहों के योग के कारण ही फल की विचित्रता मानी गई है।

 ३२६–गुरु, मंगल और सूर्य ये पुंग्रह कहलाते हैं, चन्द्रमा और शुक्र स्त्री ग्रह कहलाते हैं तथा शनि और बुध नपुंसक यह कहलाते हैं। यह कल्पना ग्रहों की उष्णता तथा उनके शैत्य के कारण की गई है।

 ३२७–आपस में पुंग्रहों के योग से धूआँ स्त्री और पुंग्रहो के योग से वर्षा तथा केवल स्त्री ग्रहों के आपस के योग से छाया होती है।

 ३२८–जिस नाड़ी में क्रूर और सौम्य ग्रह मिले हुए स्थित हों उनमें जिस दिन चन्द्रमा का समागम हो उस दिन अच्छी वर्षा समझनी चाहिये।

 ३२९– एक नक्षत्र में यदि ग्रहों का संयोग हो तो उस काल में महावृष्टि समझनी चाहिये, जब तक कि चन्द्रमा के अंश उन ग्रहों के अंशों के तुल्य हो।

 ३३०–चन्द्रमा जब पापग्रहों से वा केवल सौम्य ग्रहों से विद्ध हो तब वर्षा तो साधारण समझनी चाहिये, किन्तु दुर्दिन (मेघाच्छादिन आकाश) अवश्य होता है।

 ३३१–चन्द्रमा जिस ग्रह की नाड़ी में स्थित हो, उस ग्रह से यदि वह युक्त होजावे तथा क्षीण न दिखाई देता हो तो वह अवश्य वर्षा करता है। अर्थात् पूर्वकला (शुक्ल पक्ष की ६ से कृष्ण पक्ष की १० तक) का चन्द्रमा जिस नाड़ी में हो और उस नाड़ी का स्वामी चन्द्रमा के साथ बैठा हो वा उसे देखता हो तो वह अवश्य वर्षा करता है।

 ३३२ से ३३४–चन्द्रमा सौम्य एवं क्रूर ग्रहों के साथ यदि अमृतनाड़ी में हो तो एक, तीन वा सात दिन में दो, चार वा पाँच बार वर्षा करता है। यदि ऐसा ही चन्द्रमा जल नाड़ी में हो तो आधे दिन, पूरे दिन वा पाँच दिन तक भी वर्षा करता है। इसी प्रकार यदि चन्द्रमा क्रूर और सौम्य ग्रहों हो और जल नाड़ी में स्थित हो तो इस योग से आधा दिन, १ प्रहर वा ३ दिन तक वर्षा से युक्त होती है।

 ३३५–अमृतादि (अमृत, जल, नीर) तीन नाड़ियों में यदि सब ग्रह आजावें तो कम से १८, १२, और ६ दिन तक वर्षा समझनी चाहिये। अर्थात् अमृत नाड़ी में हो तो १८ दिन, जल में हो तो १२ और नीर में हो तो ६ दिन वर्षा हो।

 ३३६–मध्यनाड़ी में गये हुए सब ग्रह ३ दिन तक वर्षा करते हैं। शेष नाड़ियों में गये हुए सब ग्रह महावायु और दुष्टवृष्टि करते हैं।

 ३३७–अधिक शुभ ग्रहों के योग में निर्जला भी नाड़ी जलदायिनी हो जाती है। तथा अधिक क्रूर योग में सजला भी नाड़ी दाह करने वाली बन जाती है अर्थात् निर्जल नाड़ियों में भी क्रूर ग्रहों की अपेक्षा सौम्य अधिक हों तो वर्षा होती है और सजल नाड़ियों में भी यदि सौम्य की अपेक्षा क्रूर अधिक हों तो वर्षा नहीं होती।

 ३३८–दक्षिण की ३ नाड़ी में गये हुए केवल क्रूर ग्रह अनावृष्टि के सूचक होते हैं। और वे ही क्रूर ग्रह शुभ ग्रहों से युक्त हों और जलांश में अर्थात् उत्तर की तीन नाड़ियों में स्थित हों तो कुछ वर्षा करदेते हैं।

 ३३९–जलनाड़ी में स्थित चन्द्र और शुक्र यदि क्रूर ग्रहों से युक्त हो जावैं तो वे इस क्रूरयोग से अल्प वृष्टि ही करते हैं।

 ३४०–जलनाड़ी में स्थित हुए बुध, शुक्र और बृहस्पति ये चन्द्रमा से युक्त होने पर उत्तम वर्षा करते हैं।

 ३४१–जलनाड़ी में चन्द्रमा और मङ्गल आरूढ़ हों तो वे चन्द्रमा से समागम होने पर अच्छी वर्षा करते हैं।

 ३४२–अयन (गमन) काल में, संक्रम (मेल) काल में वक्रगतिकाल में, मार्गगतिकाल में (सीधी गति) अस्त वा उदय काल में इन सभी दशाओं में जलनाड़ी में प्राप्त हुए सब ग्रह महावृष्टि करने वाले होते हैं।

 ३४३–प्रकृति से ही अनूप, जांगल और मिश्र ये तीन तरह के देश होते हैं। इनमें अधिक अलवाला अनूप और अल्पजल वाला जांगल देश कहलाता है।

 ३४४–शीत, उष्ण और हवा की समानता वाला अर्थात् जिसमें ये तीनों साधारण रूप में समान हों वह मिश्र देश कहलाता है। यह मिश्र देश जांगल और अनूप देश के धर्मों की अधिकता से दो प्रकार का माना गया हैI

 ३४५–समान ग्रह योग होने पर भी विषम वर्षा हो सकती है। क्योंकि अनूपादि देशों में काल के प्रभाव से क्षेत्र में बलिष्ठता हो जाती है।

 ३४६–अनूप देशों में अधिक वर्षा, जांगल देशों में अल्पवर्षा और मिश्रदेशों में मध्यम वर्षा स्वभाव से ही होजाती है।

 ३४७–मरुदेश मारवाड़ में दुर्बल अर्थात् मामूली भी अशुभयोग वर्षा को नष्ट कर देता है, अनूप देश में प्रबल अर्थात् जबरदस्त अशुभ योग होने पर भी अल्पवर्षा तो हो ही जाती है।

 ३४८–योग करने वाला ग्रहयोग और प्रयोग अर्थात शुभ और अशुभ फल को अपने देश में ही पैदा करता है, सर्वत्र नहीं। अपनी भक्ति ( हिस्से ) का देश उस ग्रह का देश कहलाता है।

 ३४९–३५२–द्रविड़ देश का पूर्वार्द्ध, नर्मदा और शोण नदी का पूर्वार्द्ध, यमुना के दक्षिण का हिस्सा, इक्षुमती नदी, श्रीशैल तथा विन्ध्याचल के देश, चम्प, पुण्ड्र, चेदी देश, कौशाम्बी, मगध, औड्र, सुह्म, बंग, कलिङ्ग, प्राग्ज्योतिष, शवर, किरात, मेकल, चीन, बाह्लीक, यवन, काम्बोज और शक ये देश *सूयभक्ति* के समझने चाहिये।

 दुर्ग, अद्रि, द्वीप, समुद्र जलाशय, तुषार, रोम, स्त्रोराज, भरुकच्छ और कोशल देश ये *चन्द्रभक्ति* के देश हैं।

 ३५३–३५५–नासिक, दण्डक, अश्मक, केरल, कुन्तल, कौंकण, आन्ध्र, कान्ति, उत्तर पाण्डय, द्रविड, नर्मदा, शोण नदी, और भीमरथो का पश्चिम अर्धभाग, निर्विन्ध्या, शिप्रा, वेत्रवती, वेणा, गोदावरी, मन्दाकिनी, तापी, महानदी, पयोष्णी, गोमती तथा विन्ध्य, महेन्द्र और मलयाचल की नदियाँ ये सब *मंगल की भक्ति* के हैंI

 ३५६–३६२–सिन्धु और लौहित्य, गंगा, गंभीरका, रया, सरयू और कौशिकी के प्रान्त के देश, तथा चित्रकूट, हिमालय और गोमन्तपर्वत, सौराष्ट्रदेश और मथुरा का पूर्व भाग ये सब *बुध की भक्ति* में आये हुए देश हैं।

 सिन्धु का पूर्वाद्ध, मथुरा का पश्चिमार्द्धभाग तथा विराट् और शतद्रुनदी, मत्स्यदेश (जयपुरप्रान्त) का आधा भाग, उदोच्यदेश, अर्जुनायन, सारस्वत, वाटधान, रमट, अम्बष्ठ, पारत स्त्रुघ्न, सौवीर भरत, साल्व, त्रैगर्त पौरव, और योधेय ये देश *बृहस्पति की भक्ति* में आये हुए समझने चाहिये।

 वितस्ता, इरावती और चन्द्रभागा नदी, तथा तक्षशिलागान्धार, पुष्कलावत, मालवा, उशीनर, शिवि, प्रस्थल, मार्तिकावत, दशार्ण और कैकय देश ये *शुक्रभक्ति* के देश हैं।

 वेदस्मृति, विदिशा, कुरुक्षेत्र का समीपवर्ती देश, प्रभास क्षेत्र, पश्चिम देश, सौराष्ट्र आभीर, शूद्रकदेश तथा आनर्त्त से पुष्करप्रान्त तक के देश, अर्बुद (आबू और रैवतक) पर्वत ये *शनि की भक्ति* के देश समझने चाहिये।

 ३६३–मरुस्थल ( मारवाड़ ) दुर्गाचलादिक, अवगाण, श्वेत हूणदेश तथा पल्लव चोल और चौलक देश ये सब *केतु की भक्ति* में आये हुए देश समझने चाहिये।

 ३६४–शुभस्थान में जिस ग्रह का शुभ उदय हुआ हो और शुभग्रह ही उसे देख रहे हों तो उस ग्रह की भक्ति के सब देशों में शुभ ही शुभ तथा आनन्द होता है।

**इति ग्रहभक्तिदेशाधिकरणम्।**

 ३६५–इस प्रकार इस कादम्बिनी की रचना १९५० विक्रमीय सम्बत् में समाप्त हुई। इस रचना से (चर्षणि) विद्वज्जनसमूह प्रसन्न होवें।

 मूलपाठ में चर्षणीशब्द वैदिक है। इसका शब्दार्थ है–जनता। जैसे “आशुः शिशानो वृषभो न भीमो घनाघनः क्षोभरणश्चर्षणीनाम्" (यजुर्वेद)

 ३६६–जिस व्यक्ति के विष्णुपद पर अर्थात् आकाश में खस्वस्तिक पर मेघमाला पूरी छायी हुई है उस व्यक्ति को वर्षा के उदय होने के कारण आमदनी से भरी हुई आनन्द की खूब परम्परा प्राप्त होती है। इसी तरह उत्कृष्टता पूर्ण कादम्बिनी नामक ग्रन्थ को जिसने भगवच्चरणारविन्द में अर्पित किया है उसको भी वर्षा के उदय होने से आमदनी से पूर्ण आनन्द की परम्परा प्राप्त होगी यह आशा की जाती है।

 ३६७–प्राचीन ऋषियों के वृष्टिविद्यासम्बन्धी निबन्धों को देखकर नवीन और प्राचीन पद्यों से श्री मधुसुदन विद्यावाचस्पति ने इस कादम्बिनी की रचना की है।

 ३६८–इस कादम्बिनी के दिखाये हुए विषय में यद्यपि बहुत जगह त्रुटियाँ रह जाने की सम्भावना है, तथापि विद्वान लोग उपेक्षा न करके उन त्रुटियों को सुधार कर इसका अवश्य आलोचन करें।

 ३६९–वैज्ञानिक कठिन मार्ग में चलने वालों का कहीं पर स्खलन हो ही जाता है, किन्तु उन्हें देखकर वही हँसते हैं जो अशक्त मनुष्य वहाँ नहीं जा सकते।

 ३७०–दुरूह ग्रह जहाँ विचरण करते हैं ऐसे विज्ञान के विकट मार्ग में स्खलन हो जाना अवश्यंभावी है। किन्तु इस स्खलन को सहकर आगे बढ़ने से फिर श्लाघनीय गति प्राप्त हो जाती है।

 ३७१–बारम्बार ठोकरें खाकर के भी जिन पूर्वाचार्यों के द्वारा मार्ग बना दिया गया है, बुद्धिमान् कृतज्ञ मनुष्य को चाहिये कि वह उस रास्ते से जाकर और भी उसे सुधार कर सरल बनावै।

 ३७२–ज्योतिष, लोक, आलेख्य (नकशा) मिति (क्षेत्रमिति) और भुवनकोष इन पाँच अङ्गों को जानने वाला ही निमित्तशास्त्र को अच्छी तरह प्राप्त करता है।

 ३७३–निमित्तशास्त्र में निष्णात (कुशल) मनुष्य निमित्तज्ञानरूप तीसरे नेत्र से त्रिनेत्र बन कर महादेव की तरह सर्वत्र समादरणीय होता है।

 ३७४–समीक्षाचक्रवर्ती श्रीमान् महार्घ्यं मधुसूदन विद्यावाचस्पति ने इस कादम्बिनी की परीक्षार्थ रचना की है।

**समीक्षाचक्रवर्ति विद्वद्वर पं० श्री मधुसूदन शर्मा ओझा जी विद्यावाचस्पति  
के द्वारा विरचित कादम्बिनी नामक वृष्टिविद्या सम्बन्धी  
भावार्थबोधक भावानुवाद ग्रन्थ समाप्त हुआ।
