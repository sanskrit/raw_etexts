**Author’s Note.**  
<MISSING_FIG href="../books_images/U-IMG-1706434676Screenshot_20231101_045302.png"/>

 For many years my poetical compositions are being published in Sanskrit journals. As a result of the encouragement given by the Madras Government I have not only been inspired to greater poetical effort in the cause of Sanskrit but also to bring together my published poems in book-form. I am deeply indebted to the Madras Government for their kind encouragement.

 In the present volume, 1 publish the Prakriti Vilasam. Other works of mine will be published in subsequent volumes. My respectful thanks are due to His Holiness Sri (1008) Ramanuja Jeer Swamigal of Vanamamalai Math, Nanguneri, who has been pleased to bless this venture with a Srimukham and also to meet the major portion of the cost of its publication. The Hon'ble Sri P. V. Rajamannar, Chief Justice of Madras High Court, has done me a great honour by writing a foreword to this volume. I thank him for the same. I am also indebted to Sri Parikshit Tamburan, Prince of Cochin and Dr. C. S. Venkateswaran M.A., Ph. D., of the Annamalai University who have been so good as to permit me to publish their appreciation of this work, Sri N. Swaminatha Sarma, Retired Health Officer, now. at Vishnupuram, Tanjore Dt., has, with his usual generosity, contributed liberally for publishing my works, and to him I express my sincere feelings of gratefulness.

 My thanks are also due to Sri Srinivasa Raghunatha Acharya who has been publishing my poems in Telugu characters at Warangal, Hyderabad. The unbounded kindness thus extended to me by several well-wishers has impelled me to dedicate myself to, the cause of Sanskrit-learning and also to publish my collected works.

 My special thanks are due to my old student, Sri P. K. Nagaratna Sarma, Sanskrit Pandit, S. M. High School, Tiruchi and Sri A. Subrahmanyam M. A., Lecturer in Sanskrit, St. Josephs' College, Tiruchi, who have been very helpful in seeing the book through the press. In spite of the great care exerciscd by them in correcting the proofs, some errors have crept in and I regret them.

 Lastly I must express my heart-felt thanks to the Proprietor of the Kalyan Press, Tiruchi, who has shown great enthusiasm in bringing out the work in such short time and in such excellent form.

 I pray that my endeavours may be crowned with success.

FOREWORD  
<MISSING_FIG href="../books_images/U-IMG-1706435195Screenshot_20231101_045302.png"/>

 I think it really presumptuous on my part to write a foreword to the **KAVYA** of such a reputed scholar and poet like Mahamahopadhyaya K. S. Krishnamurti Sastrigal. Persons far more competent than myself have extolled his mastery of the Sanskrit Language and the beauty of his poetical style. The Government have recognised his merit in making him the Poet Laureate in Sanskrit.

 Though the works of the ancient poets abound in descriptions of nature so far as I am aware, there is no work (except probably Kalidasa's Ritusamhara) whose subject matter is exclusively the beauties of nature. The "Prakriti Vilasa' is such a work, as the title itself indicates.The Kavya is divided into several sections with special titles like '**Kananakamaneeyakam**', '**Parvataparamyam**' and '**Sameera Samarhanam**' according to the particular aspect of the beauty in nature. There is running through the entire work a passionate, sensitive and I would add, a reverential appreciation of all that is beautiful in nature. The poet has no prejudices. His emotional capacity is large enough to comprehend the majesty of the sea, the fascination of the forest, the grandeur of the mountain, the glory of the sun and the loveliness of the moon.

 Though the main theme is natural scenery, the Kavya is full of brilliant epigrams on human conduct and the affairs of the world. Often. he relates the facts of nature to human life, and this correlation is very illuminating.

 One finds in the **Kavya** strewn with lavishness, rich imagery, suggestive similes and penetrating observation. In another work of the author, **Sri Bharata. Suprabhata**, I find the following:—

 **“नायं समयः इलोकमपूर्वं रचयितुम्। शताब्देऽस्मिन्प्रकृतिवर्णने भवभूतिवज्जयशीलस्स एव भवति कृष्णमूर्तिः।”**

 I am sure all readers will echo this statement. This is a work which will enable every Sahridaya to enjoy Ananda.

Dear Sastry,

 Allow me to thank you sineerely for kindly giving me an opportunity to read your excellent poems including the Prakriti Vilasa Kavya. The spontaneous flow of beautiful expressions is simply wonderful. Apart from deriving aesthetic pleasure, a close student of these poems will greatly benefit by coming in contact with rare and interesting grammatical usages. The descriptions generally are such as will appeal even to a reader whose views on literature are influenced by modern criticisms.

 You have adorned Sri Saraswathi Devi with many gems and I feel confident that the Goddess and her devotees will bless you and appreciate your future services  
at her altar.

 Thanking you once more,

I remain,  
Yours sincerely,  
**RAMAVARMA.**

**CRITICAL APPRECIATION**  
BY  
**Dr. C. S. VENKATESWARAN M. A., Ph. D..**  
PROFESSOR OF SANSKRIT, ANNAMALAI UNIVERSITY,  
**ANNAMALAINAGAR.**

 The **Prakritivilasakavyam** of Mahamahopadhyaya Panditaraja K. S. Krishnamoorthy Sastrigal, Poet-Laureate in Sanskrit, is an exquisite collection of Nature Poems in Sanskrit. The poet depicts in eight sections of 61 verses each, the beauty of different Natural phenomena in their varied aspects.

 1. The **Sarasvatasarvasvam** describes the greatness and grandeur of the ocean in a style and metre reminiscent of Kalidasa's Meghasandesa.

 The words are addressed to the ocean by a lover of Nature who was enjoying the cool evening breeze on the beach at Cape Comerin (Kanya Kumari). Expressing this idea in the words:—

**हर्षोद्रेकादुदश्रिमवदत्सोऽपि सम्बोध्य शश्व-  
द्भेदं पश्येन्न रसिकजनश्चेतनाचेतनेषु ॥**

the poet reminds us of the lines in the Meghasandesa,

**इत्यौत्सुक्यादपरिगणयन्गुह्यकस्तं ययाचे  
कामार्ता हि प्रकृति (प्रणय) कृपणाश्चेतनाचेतनेषु ॥**

 The poet reveals his powers of observation when be describes the golden-haired, rosy cheeked European ladies moving freely on the beach, enjoying the cool evening breeze.

 There is a touch of humour when he refers to the attitude of some timid people who dare not step into the waters for a dip on the specious plea that they are unfit to drink,

 The natural position of the ever-sounding ocean below and the calm sky above is utilised by the poet to moralise that silence makes for a high position of respect and loquacity for loss of dignity.

**उच्चस्थानं जगति भजते मौनमालम्बमानो  
व्यर्थालापैजति सुमहानप्यधस्तादवस्थाम् ॥**

 The unchanging ocean which does not transgress its bounds though passing through the ever-changing Time, is represented here as a master, rich in self-control. Thus the remark. **धीरो लोके न हि विकुरुते जातु चित्कारणेषु** reminds us of Kalidasa's reference to Lord Siva in Kumarasambhava, **विकारहेतौ सति विक्रियन्ते येषां न चेतांसि त एव धीराः।**

 Again the warning given to the ocean not to terrify the courting rivers by its deafening sound on the ground that women are timid by nature,

**“शब्दैरेतैः श्रुतिकटुतरैर्मूढ ! मा भीषयस्व  
स्त्रीणां भीरूण्यबलहृदयान्यन्तरेणैव हेतुम्”**

reminds the reader at once of the Yaksha's warning to the cloud in the Meghasandesa

**तोयोत्सर्गस्तनितमुखरो मा स्म भूर्विक्लवास्ताः,**

and of Udayana's remarks about Padmavati and femi- nine timidity in the Svapnavasavadatta

**कामं धीरस्वभावेयं स्त्रीस्वभावस्तु कातरः।**

 While commenting upon the just alliance which the noble ocean formed by giving 'his' daughter Lakshmi in marriage to Lord Vishnu, the poet expresses the pregnant truth that alliance between the great is welcome to all-

**“सद्भिस्सङ्गो भवति हि सतां सर्वसंप्रीणनाय”.**

 2 Sylvan beauty in its varied aspects finds apt expression in Kananakamaniyakam. The simple sweet style which one notices here truly takes after Kalidasa's Muse. The theme affords the poet ample scope for exhibiting his descriptive power.

 One cannot fail to see the charming poetic fancy in the description of the tender creepers, sounding with the humming bees, smiling with a wealth of flowers and flushing with a profusion of tender red sprouts as embracing the mango trees-

**प्रक्रान्तचाटुवचनाः प्रणदविरेफैः  
पुष्पोद्गमैश्च रुचिरैः कृतमन्दहासाः।  
रकैर्मुशकिसलयैरनुरागपूर्णाः  
पर्यध्वजन्त लतिकास्सहकारवृक्षान् ॥**

 Fertile imagination is manifest when the poet conceives that the birds are placing groups of wing-less glow-worms in their nests at night for serving as lamps by dispelling the natural gloom.

**नीडोदरेषु तिमिरं निशि मा प्रसाङ्क्षी-  
दित्याकलय्य निजचञ्चुपुटैश्शकुन्ताः।  
कृत्वा च्छ्दैविँरहितात्रजनीमुखान्ते  
खद्योतकीटनिवहान्बत ! निक्षिपन्ति ॥**

 Naturalness abounds where the sylvan sites are described as spotted with mountains in different directions as thickly over-grown with shady trees as mantled over with green lairs and blue lakes and as having the deer moving here and there.

**उच्चावचाचलसमाकुलदिङ्मुखानि  
च्छायाद्रुमैरविरलैर्निचुलीकृतानि।  
स. श्यामशाद्वलसरोवरमेदुराणि  
कीर्णान्यवाप हरिणैश्च वनस्थलानि ॥**

 3. The theme of **Parvataparamyam** is the imposing grandeur of the Mahendra mountain described by one who is lost in its natural beauty.

**गिरिं दर्श दर्श भुवनमपि विस्मृत्य सपदि  
द्विजस्संबोध्यैवं किमपि किमपि स्वैरमवदत्।**

 The row of mountains with its verdure of creepers. and trees bearing a wealth of variegated flowers appears. to the poet's imagination as dressed in a green silken robe and as decked with an ornament of multi-coloured gems.

**वसानेव स्निग्धं हरितरुचि वासो विलससि  
प्ररूढैस्त्वय्यल्पेतरविटपिवीरुत्समुद्यैः।  
प्रसूनैरुत्फुल्लैर्हृदयहरवर्णैरिव मणि-  
प्रभेदैराकल्प कलयसि च माले ! शिखरिणाम् ॥**

 While making the significant statement that a person short of patience is not fit to be a father-in-law, the poet advises the Mahendra mountain, the source of rivers that woo the ocean Lord, not to lose patience over the ever-roaring sound of the ocean in front.

**क्षमाहीनो नैव श्वशुरपदमध्यासितुमलम् ॥**

 There is sublime beauty in the conception that the Mahendra mountain combines in itself the splendour of the Himadri \[snow-white Himalaya\] and the Hemadri \[Golden mountain, Meru\], thanks to the white fleeing clouds hanging above and the yellow creepers growing on it.

**क्वचिच्छुम्रैरभ्रैः क्वचन परिपिङ्गत्रततिभि-  
हिमाद्रिं हेमाद्रिं युगपदनुकर्तुं प्रभवसि।**

 4. **Samirasamarhanam** is a tribute paid to the wind. The poet's fertile fancy expresses itself in representing the wind as trying to propitiate the golden creepers on the river bank.....the creepers decked with flowers, bending slightly with the mellowing fruits tasted by the amorous bees and charming in their flushing beauty.

**कुसुमसुभगाः स्तोकं नम्राः फलैश्च पचेलिमैः  
रसिकमधुपाखाद्या रागश्रिया हृदयङ्गमाः।  
मृदुलपुलिना भोगान्प्राप्ता भृशं प्रियदर्शनाः  
कुनकलतिकाः कूले सिन्धोर्धिनोषि समीरण ॥**

 The poet avails himself of' an opportunity to commend the life of beings in the airy forests and villages and condemn the life in the congested city where people go for lure of gold.

**श्वसन ! सुखिनस्तिर्यञ्चोऽपि ह्यरण्यनिवासिनः  
किमधिकगिरा त्वामासेव्य द्रुमा अपि निर्मलम्।  
स्वसुखविमुखा मर्त्यास्त्वेते कुतर्कशतप्रिया  
न जहति पुरं प्राणापायेऽप्यधर्मपरायणाः ॥**

 5. The beauty of the Ganges is described in**Tripathagasaubhagyam**.

 Couched in an attractive metre, the language, like the current of the river flows slowly, but steadily creating an agreeable jingling sound. There is appealing alliteration in-

**हिमाद्रिवरनन्दिनीमखिललोचनानन्दिनी-  
मुपेन्द्रपदवन्दिनीमसमदृक्शिरस्यन्दिनीम् ।  
अघौघपरिमर्दिनीं सुभगभङ्गसन्नर्दिनीम्  
त्रयीविपिनकेकिनीं प्रणिपतामि मन्दाकिनीम् ॥**

 No less charming is the blending of the waters of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra thus described

**अभङ्गुरतरङ्गया महिमभिर्भृशं तुङ्गया  
कृपालसदपाङ्गया हरिपदांबुजासङ्गया।  
वितीर्णभवभङ्गया श्रितवतां, तथा गङ्गया  
मिलत्यमितकौतुकात् बचन धातृपुत्रा नदी ॥**

 **6.** **Dvijaraja Samrajyam** deals with lunar beauty. The poet beautifully conceives the moon as a big white lotus floating in the vast lake of the sky and representing the nature's immaculate charm, the dark speck within is due to the presence of the bees which have gathered to taste  
the honey.

**गगनसुममसिद्धं सङ्गिरन्तां विमूढा  
वियदतुलसरस्यांले श्वेतमब्जं सुजातम्।  
प्रकृतिवरपुरन्ध्र्यास्सर्वसौन्दर्यसारम्  
रसिकमधुपगर्भं मूर्तमाचक्ष्महे त्वाम् ॥**

 Both poetic fancy and wordly wisdom are revealed when the poet posits the father-son relationship between the ocean and the moon and says that the heart of the ocean buoys up with fatherly pride and joy at the sight of the moon reigning supreme in the sky; for nothing makes the father happier than the prosperity of his son.

 **7.** The brilliance of the Sun—the visible Lord of the Universe-forms the theme of **Prabhakara Prabhava.**

 The bright setting sun descending into the ocean is conceived by the poet as a colossal red-hot iron ball falling into the ocean to dry up its waters, as the shining crest jewel of Goddess Nature dropped down during her

**कुसुमसुभगाः स्तोकं नम्राः फलैश्च पचेलिमैः  
रसिकमधुपाखाद्या रागश्रिया हृदयङ्गमाः।  
मृदुलपुलिना भोगान्प्राप्ता भृशं प्रियदर्शनाः  
कुनकलतिकाः कूले सिन्धोर्धिनोषि समीरण ॥**

 The poet avails himself of an opportunity to commend the life of beings in the airy forests and villages and condemn the life in the congested city where people go for lure of gold.

**श्वसन ! सुखिनस्तिर्यञ्चोऽपि ह्यरण्यनिवासिनः  
किमधिकगिरा त्वामासेव्य द्रुमा अपि निर्मलम्।  
स्वसुखविमुखा मर्त्यास्त्वेते कुतर्कशतप्रिया

 No less charming is the blending of the waters of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra thus described-

**अभङ्गुरतरङ्गया महिमभिर्भृशं तुङ्गया  
कृपालसदपाङ्गयाहरिपदांबुजासङ्गया ।

प्रकृतिवरपुरन्ध्रयास्सर्वसौन्दर्यसारम्  
रसिकमधुपगर्भं मूर्तमाचक्ष्महे त्वाम् ॥**

 **7.** The brilliance of the Sun — the visible Lord of the Universe-forms the theme of **Prabhakara Prabhava.**

 The bright setting sun descending into the ocean is conceived by the poet as a colossal red-hot iron ball falling into the ocean to dry up its waters, as the shining crest jewel of Goddess Nature dropped down during her customary creative dance, as the embodiment of the intense love of the Lady of the Western Quarter and as the transformation of the merits of good people.

**किं तप्तायसविण्ड एष जलधिं शुष्कं विधातुं पत-  
त्याहोस्वित्प्रकृतेश्शिरोमणिरयंनृत्यात्स्वयं प्रच्युतः।  
किं वा मूर्ततरोऽनुरागनिकरो नङ्क्ष्यन्प्रतीच्याः स्त्रियः  
किं वा पुण्यफलं महत्परिणतं सत्कर्मिणां द्योमणे ॥  

महति च सुरवर्त्मन्याधिपत्यं दधानं  
प्रियतनयमुदन्वान्यामिनीनायक ! त्वाम्।  
मुदितहृदनुपश्यन्नूर्मिभिर्वर्धतेऽसौ  
न हि सुखमिह पुत्रश्रेयसोऽन्यत्पितॄणाम् ॥**

 **8. SARVARISAUNDARYAM** depicts Night's innate charm.

 The quiet night, like a sovereign balm, soothes tired nerves by promoting sweet sleep and infuses life into beings. The poet reveals his soaring imagination when he describes the Night as a descending row of black glossy clouds surcharged with the waters of the atmospheric ocean which is rich in the pearls of stars.

**तारामुक्ताप्रकरमधुराद्व्योमनाम्नोऽस्तसीम्नः  
सौन्दर्याब्धेरनुपमरसं कण्ठदग्धंपिबन्ती।  
उच्चस्थानादतिगुरुतया संपतन्ती समन्ता-  
न्माला कापि स्फुरति नु तमश्छद्मना वारिदानाम् ॥**

 Equally bold is the conception that Mother-Night fondly embraces at night her daughters, namely the masses of darkness which, by day, had been hiding themselves in the caves and trees being afraid of the sun.

**मातृप्रेम्णः किमपि न परं श्रेयसे कामनार्हम् ॥**

 Creative fancy is again evident in the portrayal of the night as a dense net-work of chains of fresh shining steel provided by Nature for linking Earth and Heaven

**प्रत्नत्वेनाञ्जनपरिचयाच्छ्यामलस्निग्धमूर्तिः  
सान्द्रा कालायसकृतबृहच्छृङ्खलामालिका या।  
सन्धातुं द्यामपि वसुमतीं कल्पिता श्रीप्रकृत्या  
सैवास्माकं स्फुरति परितः शर्वरीकैतवेन ॥**

 The busy nights of the city rendered gay by musical concerts, dance and religious discourses are contrasted with the calm nights of the village conducive to sweet sleep and longevity.

**श्लिष्टं स्निग्धैर्मुरजनिनदैर्गीतमेकत्र रात्रौ  
वंशीकृत्यं क्वचिदपरतो नर्तनं वारनार्याः।  
दाण्डाः क्रीडाः क्वचन विविधास्सत्कथानां प्रसङ्गा  
इत्थं नित्योत्सवबहुमितं पत्तनं किं न रम्यम् ॥**

**सत्यप्येवं विमलमनिलं सर्वतश्चेक्षुसार-  
स्पर्धीन्यंबून्युचितमशनं भङ्गहीनां सुषुप्तिम्।  
लब्ध्वा चिन्तालवविरहिताः स्वस्वकृत्यानुरक्ता  
जीवन्त्यब्दाञ्शतमपि समे ग्रामवासेन धन्याः ॥**

 The poet depicts as charming everything that is of the Night—the moon with its speck and light, and the pervading darkness— and concludes with optimism that nothing in Nature lacks beauty.

**रम्यश्चन्द्रस्तदुदरभवं लाञ्छनञ्चापि रम्यम्  
ज्योत्स्ना रम्यावनिपरिसरे तत्प्रसारोऽपि रम्यः।  
रम्यास्तम्यः सरसमनसामन्धकारोऽपि रम्यः  
किन्नैकोक्त्या प्रकृतिविहितं वस्तु नैवास्त्यरम्यम् \।\।**

 The author evinces considerable mastery over his art in the choice and naming of the themes, in the use of the metres and in the descriptions with refreshing variety. The poems are marked by the author's keen observation of natural phenomena, insight into the working of the human heart and power of expressing eternal truths in apt language. The poet-scholar has demonstrated in his work that he can be at home equally with the simple Kalidasan style and the erudite styles of Bhavabhuti, Bhatti and Sri Harsha. This collection of his early poems clearly brings out the natural poetic talents of the Poet-Laureate; it also assures him an honoured place among the Nature-poets in Sanskrit.
