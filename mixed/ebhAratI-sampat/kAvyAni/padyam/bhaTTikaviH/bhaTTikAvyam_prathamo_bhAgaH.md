**CRITICAL NOTICE.**

**![](../books_images/U-IMG-1725665452dasline.PNG)**

 In preparing the present edition of the Bhaṭṭi-Kâvya the following MSS. have been used**:—**  
 C. A copy of the MS. in charge of the Asiatic Society of Bengal. It is the oldest of all the MSS. that I could collect, and though I tried my best to secure it for collation, I could not get it. I was, however, able to obtain a copy of it carefully written and compared by Mr. Vâsudeva, a scribe of Calcutta. In his collec- tion of manuscripts Dr. Râjendralâla Mitra says as follows with regard to this MS. (Vide Vol. 6. Part. I. 1882, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society)**:—**

 “No. 2082. **रावणवधः।** substance, country-made yellow paper, 14×3 inches, Folia 130. Lines on a page, 6. Extent, 2,900 S'lokas, Character, Bengali. Date, S'aka 1326. Place of Deposit, Calcutta, Government of India. Verse. Correct

 Ravaṇa-Vadha. An epic poem in 22 Cantos **. . . . . .** The writing is in well-formed Bengali letters, differing in no respect from the Bengali writing by Pandits of the last century. The leaves are all stained by watermarks and the colour of the yellow orpiment with which they are dyed is very much faded, being unmistakable testimony to the age of the MS. The colour of the ink is well preserved, except in the marginal notes written at different times by different persons. The name of the scribe is Purushottam Deva S'armâ. The date of writing is S'aka 1326=A. D. 1403."  
** Beginning:—रावणवधः महाकाव्यम्. नमो गणेशाय ॥**

B**.** This was obtained from Benares through my friend, Paṇḍita Govindadâsa, who secured it from his friend, Paṇḍita Parameśvara Datta Pandeya. It is in Devanagari characters and contains the text only. It has 8 lines on a page and is incorrect in many places. It has no date. It does not seem to be old.  
** Beginning :—श्रीरामाय नमः॥ अभून्नृपो विबुधसखः &c**

 E1. This was secured from the Elphinstone College through Dr. Peterson. It contains the text only up to the fifth canto, in Devanâgarî characters. The fourth and fifth cantos are designated as the fourth canto. It has a few marginal notes up to the third canto, copied for the most part from Jayamangalâ. It is not a purely correct MS. It consists of 12 pages and is written in Samvat 1661. It has 12 or 13 lines on a page.

** Colophon:—इति भट्टिकाव्ये प्रकीर्णकाण्डे चतुर्थः सर्गः॥**

**संवति १६६१ वर्षे। कार्तिकसुदि १५॥ श्रीमद्राजधानीपुरे लिखितम्॥**

 E2. This is the second MS. obtained from the Elphinstone College through Dr. Peterson. It contains the text only in Deva- nâgarî characters and goes as far as the 10th Canto. It contains 8 lines on a page and is incorrect in many places. It is copied from a MS. in Bengali characters. There are notes on difficult words, mostly consisting of the meanings of roots, such as **आस** **उपवेशने.** The marginal notes, particularly those in Canto X. on verses illustrating **यमक** and other Alaṅkâras, are mostly copied from Jayamangala. The number of verses is not marked. It is dated the 14th Chaitra Vad, Śaṁvat 1790.

 E3. This is the third MS. received from the Elphinstone College through Dr. Peterson. It is complete and is accompanied by the commentary Jayamaṅgalâ. It is in Devanâgarî characters and is dated Saṁvat 1894.

**  Beginning:—श्रीगणेशाय नमः॥ अभून्नृपोविबुधसखः &c.**

 D. This was received from the Deccan College Library through Dr. Bhâṇḍârakar. It is in Devanâgarî characters and is very incorrect. In several places incomplete verses aregiven, the latter half being omitted. The copyist seems to be completely ignorant of the Sanskritlanguage. It contains



the complete text and the commentary of Jayamañgalâ. It is dated Saṁvat 1869.

 T₁. It is a copy of one of the MSS. of Bhaṭṭi in the Tanjore Palace Sanskrit Library, which comprises a very extensive collection of MSS., having more than 10,000 Sanskrit Volumes. With all his efforts, my friend, Prof. S. Râdhâkrishṇa Aiyar, Principal, Mahârâjâ's College, Pudukotâ, could not get me the original MSS. I had, therefore, to be content with the copies of them, secured for me by him. It was only through his untiring efforts that I was able to get copies of these Southern MSS. To ensure the correctness of the copies he engaged Paṇḍita A. R. Thirumalachariar, of Mahârâjâ's College, Pudukotâ. It was through his exertions that the MSS. of the text in the Tanjore Palace Sanskrit Library were collated and that Sargas 10 to 22 of both the copies of the commentary of Mallinâtha (the one in the Theosophical Society's Library, Adyar, Madras, and the other from Coimbatore) were copied, as also the commentary of Mallinâtha (Granth, printed) of the first 9 Sargas :

 This MS. is written in Devanâgarî characters and contains 68 pages. It is noted as a recent copy in Dr. Burnell's cata- logues, but it seems a little old. It is corrected and hence correct. It invariably contains 14 lines on each page. Additions, correc- tions, and differences of reading are marked on the margins



(right, left, top and bottom). Portions to be omitted are not erased with ink, but covered with a coloured paste. Sheets are loose, neither bound nor stitched. There are no remarks on the opening page. The copyist's name, place, and year are not known. The writing is beautiful. The MS. is complete. The headings and the concluding portion are written in red ink.

 **T**

**2**

**.** This is a copy of another Tanjore MS. It is written in Grantha characters and contains 80 cadgan leaves. It is incomplete, and comes up to the 10th verse of the 16th Canto. Verses from 31 to 45 of the 15th Canto are omitted and those from 46 to 113 given irregularly. The MS. appears to be old, being eaten in several places by worms. It has 6 or 7 lines on each page. The copyist's name, place, and year are not known.

 **T**

**3**

**.** This is a copy of the third Tanjore MS. It contains 59 cadgan leaves of the text in Grantha characters and 235 leaves of the commentary of Jayamangalâ in Devanâgarî characters. Though worm-eaten in some places, it is legible. It has 7, 8 or 9 lines on each page. It appears very old. The verses are not numbered. The last verse (35,**काव्यमिदंविहितं मया वलभ्यां**&c., of the 22nd Canto) is not found in the MS. It ends as follows**:—**

** शुभमस्तु ॥**

**विकृत्यब्देरवौ कन्यां गते पुष्ये गुरोर्दिने।  
वेङ्कटेशेन लिखितं भट्टिकाव्य विराजते॥**

 **T**

4

This is a copy of the fourth Tanjore MS. It is writeenin Grantha characters and contains 120 leaves. The last leaf (120) is lost and the MS. ends with the word **पतिः** in the verse 31 of the 22nd Canto,

 I got two other MSS. after the text had been printed off for the most part. The readings of these are therefore given in the Appendix. Of these the first designated Ds is in the Deccan College Government Collection. I collated it in the College while I was acting as Professor of Oriental Languages there. It is incomplete, proceeding up to St. 26, C. XII. It bears no date.



The second was secured by me through my friend, Mr. Amidhara Raṇacchodajî Desâi, Assistant Master, Ahmedâbâd High School, from Paṭṭaṇa. His brother, Mr. Haridhara R. Desâi, B. A., was kind enough to collate it for me, and also send the MS. to me. I then collated it myself. The MS. bears no date and proceeds up to the 10th Canto. It is incorrect in many places. It is designated P. in the Appendix.

 For the commentary of Mallinâtha I have consulted four Southern copies. The first is a printed copy in Grantha characters from Canto I. to Canto IX. The second is also a printed copy in Telugu characters from Canto I. to Canto IX. The third is a copy of the MS. of Bhaṭṭi with the commentary of Mallinâtha in charge of the Theosophical Society of Madras from Canto X. to the end. The phrase **श्रीनृर्सिहाय नमः**abounds in the MS. without exception in the beginning and end of every Sarga. The commentary is so full of mistakes that it would require as much time to be corrected as itself to be copied. The blank spaces are to be filled up with very great care and attention. The fourth and the best copy of the commentary was secured from Râma Sâstriar of Kadathur, near Udamalpet, Coimbatore District. It is about 80 or 100 years old. It contains 158 pages with 12 or 13 lines on a page and is written in Grantha characters. 15 leaves are worm-eaten. Telugu notes appear in one or two places as in describing the metre of the 19th Canto. The MS. is very correct. There are no orthographical blunders in the first three-fourths of the book. In the last few pages which are also remarkably correct, there are a few mistakes such as the indiscriminate use of da and dha for da and dha. I got a copy of this excellent MS. of the commentary through the indefatiguable energy of Prof. S. Râdhâ- krishṇa Aiyar, who writes to me as follows:—You will be glad to hear that I have after all succeeded in my attempt to secure another copy of Mallinâtha's commentary on the Bhaṭṭi-Kâvya. It was obtained from Râma Sâstriar of Kadathur with some difficulty no doubt. I doubt whether the copy would ever have



reached me, were it not for the kindness and the official position of my friend, Mr. Srinivâsa Aiyar, B. A., Stationary Sub-Magistrate of the place in Coimbatore.

 I must consider you fortunate, as the Pandit tells me that the writing is very legible (Grantha) and that the commentary is complete with the exception of that of a portion (10 S'lokâs) in the 10th Chapter for which blank space is provided in the palmleaf Manuscript. The MS. appears to be about 100 years old and is pronounced to be correct."

INTRODUCTION.

![](../books_images/U-IMG-17257206511.PNG)

 The Bhaṭṭi-Kâvya, otherwise known as Râvaṇavadha, is a grammatical poem, composed by the poet Bhaṭṭi with the object of illustrating Paṇinî's Sûtras. It is, as Mallinâtha calls it, an *Udâharaṇa-Kâvya* or illustration-poem of the Sutras of Pâṇini. It is divided into four sections, *Prakîrṇa-Kâṇḍa, Adhikara-Kâṇḍa Prasanna-Kâṇḍa,* and Tiñanta-*Kâṇḍa,* The first of these sections, comprising the first five Cantos, illustrates miscellaneous Sutras at random. The second section embraces four Cantos from the fifth to the ninth, and illustrates what are known as *Adhikâra- [Sútras](# "Sûtras are of six kinds:— संज्ञा च परिभाषा च विधिर्नियम एव च। अतिदेशोऽधिकारश्च षड्विधं सूत्रलक्षणम्॥'")*or head-rules that exercise a kind of governing influence on certain subsequent rules, having to be repeated in them all. Taddhita and Kṛit affixes, changes of **न्** to **ण्**and **स्** to, **ष्** addition of **आम्** to certain roots in Perfect, rules of Guṇa and Vṛiddhi in आम् Aorist, government of cases and similar portions of grammar come under this section, in which verses are so arranged that they illustrate the Sutras of Panini in the order of the Ashṭâdhyâyî, excepting only those that are applicable to the Vedic literature. Illustrations of miscellaneous Sutras are interspersed here and there between those of *Adhikára-Sûtras*. The third section illustrates a portion of poetics, touching figures of speech (both S'abdalankâras and Arthâlankâras), Guṇas Madhurya and Bhavika, and *Bhâshásama*, a figure of speech in which wordsare so selected and arranged that the sentence belongs at once to Saṁskṛita and Prâkṛita. This section takes up four Cantos from the 10th to the 13th. The remaining nine Cantos illustrate all the Tenses and Moods, all the Lakáras except **लट्**which is concerned only with the Vedic literature.



 The Bhaṭṭi**-**Kâvya is a work of great renown. It is held to be a sort of authority on questions of grammar. When a particular form occurring in it seems to violate Pâṇini, it is with great reluctance that commentators call it *Pramâda* or a mistake. Great ingenuity is shewn in establishing its correctness. Bhaṭṭoji Dîkshita has quoted instances from the [work](# "Among the quotations from the Bhatti-Kavya in the Siddhanta- Kaumudi and the Manoramá may be mentioned ' पितॄनतासत् ' १, २ ( K. p. 236), ' शस्त्राण्युपायंसत जित्वराणि ' १, १६ (म० उ० p. 45, 46 ), ' ततोऽनुजज्ञे गमनं सुतस्य ' १, २३ ( K. p. 279), ' भाघ्रायि वान् गन्धवहः सुगन्धः ' २, १० ( म०पू० p. 73) ' अजिग्रहतं जनको धनुस्तत् ' २, ४२ ( म०पू० p. 51 ), सतीतयो राघवयोरधीयन् ' ३, १८ ( K. p. 227 ), 'न चोपलेभे वणिजां पणायान् ' ३, २७ (म० उ० p. 14), 'पुरो रामस्य जुहवांचकार ज्वलने वपुः ' ४, ५, ( म०पू० p.65), ' पर्षद्वलान् महाब्रसैराट नैकटिकाश्रमान् ? ४, १२ ( म०पू० p. 104), ' वावृत्यमाना सा रामशालां न्यविक्षत' ४, २८ ( K. p. 234 ), 'विनसा हतबान्धवा ' ५ ८ ( K. p. 88 ), ' हा पितः क्कासि हे सुभ्रु' ५, ११ ( K. p. 28 and म० पू० p. 29), ' तेन संगतमार्येण रामाजयं कुरु द्रुतम् ' ६, ५४ ( K. p. 291), 'राघवस्य ततः कार्य कारुर्वानरपुङ्गवः । सर्ववानरसेनानामाश्वागमनमादिशत् ॥ ' ७, २८ (म० उ० p. 68 ), । ! आहध्वं मा रघूत्तमम् ' ७, १०३ Com. (K. p. 275 ), ' कलहंसराममहितः कृतवान् १०, २ 275), ' ( म०पू० p. 61), ' उपायंस्त महास्त्राणि १५, २१ (म० उ० p. 45 ), and ' हविर्जक्षिति निःशङ्को मखेषु मघवानसौ १८, १९ ( K. p. 34 ).")in his Siddhânta-Kaumudî and Manoramâ, in some cases to support his view of the Sûtras and in others to explain their apparent deviation from [them.](# " It must be noted that the forms, which are departures from Pâṇini, can hardly be called incorrect; as other grammars, that have now been lost, were in the time of Bhatti considered authoritative. In two or three places Mallinatha says:—' व्याकरणान्तरे द्रष्टव्यम्.'")The fact that he has to explain their departures from Pâṇini, saying **‘कथंतर्हि भट्टिः’**establishes the authoritativeness of the work. Another work that like the Bhaṭṭi-Kâvya is known to illustrate the rules of Pâṇini's grammar, is the Râvaṇârjunîya, composed by [Bhaumaka](#)and well-known in Kâs'mira. Bhaumaka lived





before Jayâditya, the author of the Kâs'ikâ, and the Kâs'mira poet Kshemendra; because the Kâs'ikâ contains a quotation from the Râvaṇârjunîya. The following half verse is quoted in the Vṛitti on the Sûtra **“अनुवादे चरणानाम्” २।४।३॥**from Bhaumaka's poem**:—**

**‘उद्गात् कठकालापं प्रत्यष्ठात् कठकौथुमम्।’**

 The same verse is quoted in the Siddhânta-Kaumudî also. The whole verse is**:—**

**‘उदगात् कठकालापं प्रत्यष्ठात् कठकौथुमम्।  
येषां यज्ञे द्विजातीनां तद् द्विजातिभिरन्वितम्॥’ ७.४.॥**

  **i.e** **राक्षससभं सचिवैः सह दशकण्ठो विवेश.** Kshemendra's Suvṛittatilaka has a verse **'शास्त्रकाव्यं चतुर्वर्गप्रायं सर्वोपदेशकृत्। भट्टिभौमककाव्यादि काव्यशास्त्रं प्रचक्षते॥’ ३, ४.**naming Bhaṭṭi and Bhanmaka. This work is more [artificial](# " It is divided into 27 Cantos. The Pádas of the Ashtadhyayî are illustrated in order, each Pâda, beginning with the second, (the first dealing only with sanjnyás being omitted) being generally illustrated by one Canto ( गाङ्कुटादिपादे प्रथमः सर्गः, भूवादिपादे द्वितीयः सर्गः, आकडारादिपादे तृतीयः सर्गः and so forth ).")than the Bhaṭṭi-Kâvya and this perhaps is the reason why it has not become so popular.

 The subject treated in the Bhaṭṭi-Kâvya is the story of Râma, whose virtues and exploits have given scope to so many poets to shew their [powers.](# " † The story of Rama is the sole subject of Vâlmîki's Râmâyaṇa and 'Adhyatma-Râmâyaṇa, and occupies a place in Agni-Purâṇa") Beginning with Daśaratha, the  
———————————————————————————————————————————————————

and this is confirmed by the Extracts in Bühler's own Report. See Appendix to that work LXXXV. I. 19 **भूभढ्ढस्येति** which should be corrected to **भूमभट्टस्येति,** and not as is done in the note, and I. 23 **काव्येत्र भूमोदिते**a reading which should not be marked as a doubtful reading. Bhûma, or Bhûmaka and Bhaumaka are variations easily explained by the Kashmir pronunciation." (Dr. Peterson's Preface to Subhashitavali p. 83). A. Deccan College Manuscript (No. 184 collection of 1875-76) ascribes the work to the poet Bhima. **‘इति** **महाकविश्रीमद्भीमकृते रावणार्जुनीये महाकाव्ये गाङ्कुटादिपादेप्रथमः सर्गः’** and so forth at the end of each Canto. But Kshemendra in his Suvṛittatilaka gives Bhaumaka as the name of the author.



work comes down to the destruction of Râvana and Rama's return to Ayodhyâ. It is a Mahâ-[kâvya,](# "A Mahâkâvya is thus defined by Dandin:—  सर्गबन्धो महाकाव्यमुच्यते तस्य लक्षणम् । आशीर्न मस्क्रिया वस्तुनिर्देशो वापि तन्मुखम् ॥ इतिहासकथोद्भूतमितरद्वा सदाश्रयम् । चतुर्वर्गफलोपेतं चतुरोदात्तनायकम् ॥ नगरार्णव शैल चन्द्रार्कौदयवर्णनैः । उद्यानसलिलक्रीडामधुपानरतोत्सवैः ॥ विप्रलम्भैर्विवाहैश्च कुमारोदयवर्णनैः । मन्त्रदूतप्रयाणाजिनायकाभ्युदयैरपि ॥ अलंकृतमसंक्षिप्तं रसभावनिरन्तरम् । सर्गैरनतिविस्तीर्णैः श्रव्यवृत्तैः सुसन्धिभिः ॥ सर्वत्र भिन्नवृत्तान्तैरुपेतं लोकरञ्जकम् । काव्यं कल्पान्तरस्थायि जायेत सदलंकृति ॥ '  By चतुरोदात्त नायक is meant धीरोदात्त नायक who is defined as:—  अविकत्थनः क्षमावानतिगम्भीरो महासत्त्वः । स्यान्निगूढमानो धीरोदात्तो दृढव्रतः कथितः ॥ '  As regards the incidental description of नगर, अर्णव &c, it is stated that  'न्यूनमप्यत्र यैः कैञ्चिदङ्गैः काव्यं न दुष्यति । यद्युपात्तेषु संपत्तिराराधयति तद्विदः ॥")as the oldest.commentator Jayamaṅgala, Mallinâtha, and others [call it.](# "' लक्ष्यं लक्षणं चोभयमेकत्र विदुषः प्रदर्शयितुं श्रीस्वामिसूनुः कविर्भट्टिनामा रामकथाश्रयम- हाकाव्य चकारं ।' जय०.")

grammar, it can not be expected to come up in point of beauty to any one of the well-known Mahâ-Kâvyas. Still it must be said in fairness to the author that the work is by no means dry or dull, and that there are many [passages](# "The following are some of these passages in the first nine Cantos:— Canto I., Sts. 6, 7, 8. Canto II., the description of Sarad (Sts. 2-19), 25, 41, 47. Canto III., Sts. 12-14, 51-55; Canto IV., Sts. 35, 36, 38, 39. Canto V., Sts. 10-45, 51, 71-74,84-89, 102. Canto, VI., 10-39, Râma's grief for Sita (73-85), 104, 105. Canto VII., the description of the rainy season and Râma's state in it ( 1-13), 96-99, 106-109. Canto VIII., 82-84, 95-98, 104–126. Canto IX. 55-57, 107, 110-136.")in it, which can stand comparison with the best passages of any of the Mahâ-Kâvyas.

 Having thus informed the reader of the nature of the work, its contents, and popularity, I now turn to the question of the name of the author and the age in which he lived. Colebrooke considers Bhartṛihari to be the author of the work. He says**:—**The opening Stanza of the Bhaṭṭi-Kâvya may serve as an instance of *Ruchird* metre. The poem, bearing that title, is on the subject of the adventures of Râma. It is composed in twenty-two Cantos. Being composed purposely for the practical illustration of grammar, it exhibits a studied variety of diction, in which words anomalously inflected are most frequent. The style, however, is neither obscure nor inelegant, and the poem reckoned among the classical compositions in the Sanskrit language. The author was Bhartṛihari, not as might be supposed, the celebrated brother of Vikramâditya, but a grammarian and poet who was son of S'rîdharaswâmin as we are informed by one of his scholiasts, [Vidyâvinoda.'](# "Colebrooke's Essays Vol. II., p. 115-116.")

 Dr. Bhau Dâji remarks that Bhaṭṭi is popularly believed to have been a son of [Bhartrihari.](# "Journal of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society 1862, p. 219.") S'âstrîS'eshagiri observes:—



“The name Vikramâditya is applied to several kings and consequently causes considerable confusion. The first sovereign that is known by it was the Vikramâditya from whom the well-known era takes its name. He is said to have been the son of a Brahmaṇa, named Chandragupta, who married four wives, one of the Brahman caste, another of the Kshatriya, the third of the Vais'ya, and the fourth of the S'udra caste. They were called Brahmani, Bhânumati, Bhâgyavatî, and Sindhumatîrespectively. Each of the four bore him a son. Vararuchi was born of the first wife, Vikramârka of the second, Bhaṭṭi of the third, and Bhartrihari of the fourth. Vikramarka became king while Bhaṭṭi served him as Prime-Minister. After an incredibly long reign he is said to have been killed by a Prince of the potter caste, named S'alivâhana in 56 B. C. and in that year commences his [era".](# "Indian Antiquary Vol. I., p. 319. This story is mentioned by Bohlen also. ")In his Preface to the S'atakas Bohlen remarks**:—**“They say that Vikrama in fact got possession of the kingdom and took to himself Bhatti as Prime-Minister. But in this again they seem to have gone wrong, confounding both persons and times. For there exists a grammatical poem called Bhaṭṭi-Kâvya, describing at the same time the exploits of Râma, which has been attributed to a certain grammarian belonging to a later age called Bhartrihari, and from the name of this poem, I think, Bhaṭṭi seems to have been considered as the brother of this, our Bhartṛi[hari."](# " Bohlen's Preface to the S'atakas p. 6.") These writers seem to have been misled by what some of the Commentators on the work have said. Nârâyaṇavidyâvinod[âchârya](# "He was son of Vânes'vara, brother of Jatâdhara, of the family of Pûrvagrâma. In explaining grammatical forms he cites the authority of Kramadiśvara's Sankshiptasâra, used in Bengal.")gives Bhartṛihari as the name of the author. He thus begins his commentary, which he calls Bhaṭṭibodhinî**:—“नत्वा रामपदद्वन्द्वमरविन्दं भवच्छिदम्। विद्याविनोद आचार्यः कुरुते भट्टिबोधिनीम्॥ अथ पाणिनिकृतलक्षणार्थानवगन्तुमशक्नुवतां भाष्यकारजिनेन्द्रप्रभृतिनानाम-**

'**Bharata-mallika, 'who lived at Kânchârpârâ in the Hooghly district, about 150 years [ago,'](# "Dr. Rajendralâla Mitra's notices of Sanskrit manuscripts Vol. VI, Part I., published in 1882 pp. 145 et sequentes.") speaks of Bhartṛihari as the author of the work in his commentary, Mugdhabodhinî**:—नत्वा शंकरमभ्वष्टगौराङ्गमल्लिकात्मजः। भट्टिटीकां प्रकुरुते भरतो** **मुग्धबोधिनीम्॥ ...... भर्तृहरिर्नाम कविः श्रीरामकथाश्रयं चकार।'.**The manuscript from Benares, collated by me, and designated B., calls the poem Bhaṭṭi-Kâvya at the end of each Canto without naming the [author,](# "' इति श्रीमट्टिकाव्ये प्रकीर्णकाण्डे विश्वामित्रगमनो नाम प्रथमः सर्गः' and so forth at the end of each Canto except the twelfth.")but at the end of the twelfth Canto it states **‘इति श्रीभर्त्तृहरिकृते भट्टिकाव्ये द्वादशः सर्गः।’**

** **This is all the evidence that could be gathered in favour of calling the author Bhartṛihari or of connecting Bhaṭṭi with Bhartṛihari. Let us now examine it minutely and see whether it is reliable. Colebrooke has no independent evidence to stand upon, his statement being, as he himself tells us, simply based upon that of Vidyávinoda. Bohlen too rests his conclusion on mere tradition and on the statement of some of the commentators. Though the commentators Nâráyaṇa Vidyavinodâchâryâ, Vidyâvinoda, Kandarpachakravartin and Bharata call the author Bhartṛihari, still they name the work Bhaṭṭi without however assigning any reason why it should have been so styled.

 We thus come to two questions, I, whether Bhaṭṭi is the name of the author of the poem known as Bhaṭṭi-Kâvya, and II.



whether he was identical with Bhartrihari or distinct from him. The oldest manuscript C. and two other manuscripts D₂and T₃distinctly call the work Râvaṇavadha and the author Bhaṭṭi. Jayamangala and Mallinâtha, both call the author Bhaṭṭi. Traditions described by Dr. Bhau Dâji and S'âstri S'eshagiri mention Bhatti and Bhartrihari as two distinct persons. In the Index to Professor Aufrecht's catalogue of the Oxford MSS. Bhaṭṭi is stated to be the author of the Bhaṭṭi-[Kâvya.](# "Vide p. 509.") Bhatti's name is found in a verse in the [Bhojaprabandha](# "भट्टिर्नष्टो भारवीयोऽपि नष्ट भिक्षुर्नष्टो भीमसेनोऽपि नष्टः । भुकुण्डोऽहं भूपतिस्त्वं च राजन् भम्भापङ्क्क्तावन्तकः संनिविष्टः॥").Bhaṭṭi is mentioned by name by [Kshemendra](# "Vide the verse quoted on p. XI.") of the 11th century and Vallabhadeva of the 15th century. In Vallabhadeva's Subhashitavali, both Bhaṭṭi and Bhartrihari have been separately cited. In the last-named work verses are quoted from the Bhaṭṭi-kâvya under three names, Bhaṭṭi, Bhattasvamin, and [Bhartrisvamin.](# "C. II.

verses, which are assigned to Bhaṭṭ

i in the Subhashitavali, are attributed to Bhaṭṭ

asvamin and Bhartṛisvâmin in the S'ârnga- dharapaddhati of the fourteenth [century.](# "गर्जन् हरिः &c. (C. II. St. 9 ) attributed to Bhatti in the Subhâshitâvali is mentioned under the name of Bhattasvâmin in the S'ârngadharapaddhati. The reading there is सरोषः in place of सकोप. ( Vide No. 591 in Dr. Peterson's edition of S'âriga.).न तच्जलं यत्र सुचारुपङ्कजं &c. ( C. II. St. 19 ) is in the S'ârngadharapaddhati attributed to Bhartṛisvâmin (Vide No. 3904 in Dr. Peterson's edition of S'ariga.).")The Jayamangalà as given in the Deccan College manuscript, designated D. by me, calls the work Bhartṛi-Kavya and the author [Bhartṛi.](# "It begins thus:—‘प्रणिपत्य सकलवेदिनमतिदुस्तरभर्त्तृकाव्यसलिलनिधेः । जयम- इलेति नाम्रा नौकेव विरच्यते टीका ॥ लक्ष्यं लक्षणं चोभयमेकत्र विदुषां प्रदर्शयितुं श्रीस्वामि- सूनुः कविर्भर्त्तृनामा रामकथाश्रयं महाकाव्यं चकार ॥   Cantos are wound up in these words :—' इति श्रीभर्त्तृकाव्ये प्रकीर्णकाण्डे रामसंभवो नाम प्रथमः ( द्वितीयः and so fourth ) सर्गः।")At the end of each Canto in the manuscript the word Bhartṛi- kâvya and not Bhaṭṭ

i-kâvya is found. I am therefore of opinion that Bhaṭṭ

i, Bhaṭṭ

asvâmin, and Bhartṛisvâmin are three names of the same person. In his big Catalogue of Manuscripts Aufrecht says**:—**Bhaṭṭ

i called also Bhartṛi- svâmin or Bhaṭṭ

asvâmin or Svâmibhaṭṭ

a, author of the Bhaṭṭ

i-Kâvya'. That he was son of S'rîdharasvâmin or S'rî- svâmin is mentioned by many [commentators](# " The Ms. c. at the end says:—इति वङभीवास्तव्यश्रीधरस्वाभिसूनोर्भढ्ढब्राह्मणस्य कृतौ रावणवधे महाकाव्ये तिङन्तकाण्डे लुट्प्रदर्शनो नाम द्वाविंशतितमः सर्गः । ' Jaya - · mangala calls him son of S'rîsvâmin, Kumudânanda in his Subodhinî does the same. 'अत्र कविना श्रीस्वामिमनुना सर्गबन्धलक्षणं प्रकीर्णकाण्डं प्रथमं दर्शयितुं तस्य विषयव्यापकत्वात् तत्रादौ वस्तुनिर्देशं कुर्वन् इष्टदेवतास्मरणात्मकं मङ्गलं विघ्नोपशान्तये करोति ।'. Nârâyaṇavidyâvinoda gives Sridharasyâmin as the name of his father."). Bhartṛi must have been his name, as is found in the Jayamaṅgalâ of the



MS. D. Bhaṭṭ

i is the Prâkṛita form of the Saṁskṛita, word Bhartṛi and his father's name being S'rîsvâmin or S'rîdhara-svâmin, he was called Bhartṛisvâmin, a combination of the name Bhartṛi with the family appendage, Svâmin. The Gujarâti names contain many instances of this kind. If the father's name ends in S'ankara, Râma, Nârâyaṇa, or some such word, the son's name also generally ends in the same form. Bhaṭṭ

a must have been his surname, and it being combined with Svâmin, he was called Bhaṭṭasvamin or [Svâmibhaṭṭa.](# "This, it must be said, is rather a strange combination of words. Dr. Rajendralâla considers the word 'Bhatti' as a diminutive of the word 'Bhatta' (Vide his Notices of Sanskrit MSS. Vol. VI. Part I, p. 145); but for this there seems to be no authority.")Thus Bhaṭṭi being the Prâkrita form and probably the pet-name, became the most commonly known and the author came to be popularly called by it. Finally as Bhaṭṭi does not look like a proper name, and is the Prâkṛita form of Bhartṛi, later [scholiasts](# "Kandarpachakravartin, Vidyâvinoda, and Bharatamâllika are later Bengal commentators, none of whom are believed by Dr. Rajendralâla to have flourished at an earlier date than 265 years from this time.") were misled in calling him Bhartṛihari, parti- cularly as the latter was well known as a grammarian.

 Let me now turn to the question of the age of the author. He composed his work, as he himself informs us, in ValabhÎ (modern Valâ, the chief town of the native state of the same name in the Gohilwâḍa Prânta in Kâṭhiawâḍa) in the time of Dharasena. The last verse of this Bhaṭṭi-Kâvya runs as follows**:—**

**‘काव्यमिदं विहितं मया वलभ्यां  
श्रीधरसेननरेन्द्रपालितायाम्।  
कीर्त्तिरतो भवतान्नृपस्य तस्य  
प्रेमकरः क्षितिपो यतः प्रजानाम्॥’**



 In the word S'rî-Dharasena used in the above verse, S'rÎ is simply [honorific.](# "It is found prefixed to the names of many kings in grants. A grant of Guhasena, dated Samvat 243, shews clearly that the name is Dharasena and not S'rî-Dhasarena. It thus names the different kings beginning with Bhatárka:— 'श्रीसेनापतिभटार्कः, श्रीसेनापतिधरसेनः, श्रीमहाराजद्रोणसिंहः, श्रीमहाराजध्रुवसेनः '. Vide the Indian Antiquary. Vol. VII. p. 67, 80 also a grant of Dhruvasena I., dated Samvat 216, Vide The Ind. Ant. Vol. IV p. 105, and another of the same king dated Saṁvat. 207, vide The Ind. Ant. Vol. V. p. 205.")The copperplate grants of Valabhî kings that have come to hand shew that there were four kings of the name of Dharasen[a.](# "The genealogy of Valabhi kings as gathered from their copperplate grants is as follows:—") The dates of Dharasena I. can not be

ascertained, as none of his grants have been hitherto discovered. The extreme limits between Dharasena II. and Dharasena IV. seem to be 80 years, as the earliest grant, hitherto known, of Dharasena II. is dated Saṁvat 252, and the latest grant of Dharasena IV. is dated Saṁvat 332. A grant of Dhruvasena III. is dated Saṁvat 332. This settles the date of the end of Dharasena IV.'s reign. The beginning of his reign is less certain, as only one grant of his predecessor, Dhruvasena II., dated Saṁvat 310, has been found. The Saṁvat referred to in these grants is the Valabhi or Gupta [era,](# "'The era used by the Valabhi princes must be the Valabhi era . . . . . The era introduced and used by the Valabhis was that of the Guptas, whose dependants they were in the beginning, and hence Albiruni's statement that the initial date of the Gupta and Valabhî eras was the same is true'. Dr. Bhândârakar's Early History of the Dekkan' p. 98.")the first year of which corresponds to A. D. 319 as settled by a stone inscription of Somanâth-Pattana, shewing a grant of Arjunadeva of [Gujarat.](# "This inscription was first discovered by Colonel Tod. ('Annals of Rajasthâna' Vol. I. p. 705, and ' Travels in Western India' p. 506). The original of it is in the temple of Harsata at Verâval.")The inscription is dated in the Hijra year 662, Vikrama Saṁvat 1320, Valabhî Saṁvat 945, and Simha Saṁvat 151, Ashâḍha [Vadi 13.](# "The Hindu account of the destruction of Valabhî, preserved by Albiruni is that soon after the foundation of the Sindh capital Mansura (A. D. 750-770) Ranka, a disaffected subject of Valabhî, bribed the Arab lord of Mansûra to send a naval expedition against Valabhi. 'In a night attack king Valabha was killed and his people and town were destroyed'. Bombay Gazetteer Vol. I. Part I. p. 94.") Thus Vikrama Saṁvat 376 or S'aka 242 was the first year of the Valabhi era. As Al-birûnî states, S'aka S. 242 and Vikrama Saṁvat 376 was the starting-point of the Gupta or Valabhi era ('era of Balab'). Gukasena's son Dharasena II. is considered to be the patron of Bhaṭṭi by Lassen, but this is nothing more than a mere [guess.](# "Vide Max Müler's 'India, What can it teach us' p. 350.") The name of Bhaṭṭi is found





in two ValabhÎ copperplates. In Dhruvasena I.'s grant, dated Saṁvat 221, he is described as an officer superintending the king's kitchen and as executive officer.**‘दूतकस्सूपकारपतिभट्टि लिखितं [किक्ककेनेति'.](# "This copper-plate grant of Samvat 221 has not yet been printed. It was brought to my notice by Acharya Vallabhaji Haridatta of Rajkot. He writes to me that it was one of the many copperplates that were brought to him. He copied them for himself and then returned them to him.")**His name is also found as that of the done in Dhruvasena III.'s grant, dated Saṁvat 334.**'श्रीभुत्रसेनः कुशली सर्वानेव समाज्ञापयति—‘अस्तु वः संविदितम्—यथा मया मातापित्रोः पुण्याप्यायनाय महिच्छ (क) विनिर्गतमहिच्छकवास्तव्यैतच्चातुवैिद्यसामान्यकौशिकसगोत्रवाजसनेयसब्रह्मचारिब्राह्मण[विप्पुत्रभट्टिभदाय](# "The title Bappa or Båva seems to have been applied to ecclesiastical dignitaries. Though it seems to have been specially associated with S'aivas, it was applied to Vaishnava dignitaries as well. A. Buddhist Vihâra is called Bappapâdîyavihâra. vide Ind. Ant. Vol. VI. p. 9.") शिवभागपुरविषये दक्षिणपट्टे पट्टपद्रकगामः सोद्रङ्गः** **सोपरिकरः . . . . . . . . . .उदकातिसर्गेण धर्मदायो निसृष्टः**। '[If the](# "Archæological Survey of India p. 86–88.") Bhaṭṭi of these two grants be the same as our poet, it gives him a rather long [life.](# "Considering him to be at least 20 when he was दूतक and to have lived 5 years after the grant was made to him, he seems to have lived: at least 138 years.")There is, however, no evidence to prove that the poet Bhaṭṭi is identical with the Bhaṭṭi of these grants, nor is there any evidence to prove which of the Dharasenas was his patron. From the fact that the Valabhi dynasty was at no time free from vassalage except in the reign of Dhara- sena IV., who calls himself ' **महाराजाधिराजपरमेश्वरचक्रवर्त्तिश्रीधरसेनः’** some think that the Dharasena referred to by Bhaṭṭi in his last, verse is Dharasena IV. The well-known Sanskrit poem Bhaṭṭi- Kâvya seems to have been composed in the reign of this king as at the end of his work the author says it was written at Valabhi protected (governed) by the king, the illustrious Dharasena.



The author's application to Dharasena of the title Narendra, Lord of Men, is a further proof of his great power' (Bombay Gazetteer Vol. I. Part I. p. 92). But even Dharasena I. calls himself Mahâsâmanta as well as Mahârâja and therefore the application of the word **नरेन्द्र**hardly warrants the conclusion that the supreme lord, the Chakravartin Dharasena, i. e. Dharasena IV., is alluded to by the poet. Thus it is difficult to decide in the present state of our knowledge what particular Dharasena was the author's patron. But this much is certain that one of them was and that therefore our poet lived in the latter part of the sixth and the beginning of the seventh century.

**COMMENTARY.**

![](../books_images/U-IMG-172607140411.PNG)

The following are the commentaries on the Bhatti- Kâvya**:—**

*Jayamangala by Jayamangala.  
One by Harihara.  
Kalapadipika by Punḍarikáksha, son of Srikanta.  
Vaijayanti by Kandarpas'arman or Kandarpachakra- vartin.  
Bhaṭṭichandrika by Vidyâvinoda.  
Mugdhabodha by Râmânanda.  
Mugdhabodhini by Bharatamallika.  
Subodhini by Kumudânanda.  
Bhattibodhini by Narayaṇavidyavinoda.  
Subodhini by Râmachandravâchaspati.  
Kalapadipika by Vidyâsagara.  
Bhâshávṛitti by Purushottama.  
Sarvapathina by Mallinâtha.*

 Of these Jayamaṅgalâ by Jayamaṅgala is the oldest and has become the most popular. It explains all the grammatical forms well. Some of the above commentaries name other authorities than Pâṇini. Bhâshavṛitti makes [Kâtantra](# " Kalâpa or Kâtantra is a grammar of which the rules are ascribed to the god Kumara. It is much used in Bengal. There are many commentaries on it such as Daurgasimht by Durgasimha, Kâtantrapañjikâ by Trilochanadâsa, Kâtantrachandrikâ; Chaitrakuți and Kalâpatatvârṇava.")its grammatical authority. Bhaṭṭibodhini explains all grammatical references by citing the authority of the Saṅkshiptasâra [grammar.](# " Sankshiptasâra is composed by Kramadiśvara. It is also used in Bengal. There is a commentary on it by Gopâlachakravartin and Goyichandra. Durghaṭaghatana is another commentary on the work.") KalâpadÎpikâ explains the text by references to the



rules of the Kaâpa**-**Vyâkaraṇa. Bharatamallika quotes the Sûtras from the [Mugdhabodha](# "Mugdhabodha is composed by Vopadeva. This grammar is also. much studied in Bengal like Kalâpa and Sankshiptasâra. There are- many commentaries on it, one by the author himself, another, styled Subodhini, by Durgâdâsa, a third by Râmânanda and so forth. Vopa- deva's other works are Kavikalpadruma, an alphabetical catalogue of roots in verse, which contains a verse mentioning eight grammarians ' इन्द्रश्चन्द्रः काशकृत्स्नापिशली शाकटायनः । पाणिन्यमरजैनेन्द्रा जयन्त्यष्टादिशाब्दिकाः॥ ")grammar in explaining the forms.

 Mallinâtha's commentary on the Bhaṭṭi-Kâvya like his famous commentary on the well-known Mahâkâvyas is a running commentary, explaining each word in the order of the Anvaya (grammatical sequence), marking points of grammar and Alankâra and citing authorities. He is true to his promise**—'** **इहान्वयमुखेनव सर्वंव्याख्यायते मया। नाभूलं लिख्यते किञ्चिन्नानपेक्षितमुच्यते !!'.** It is an excellen: commentary. It is not so well-known as Jayamaṅgalâ firstly because Jayamangalâ is a very old [commentary](# "Jayamangala's definitions of Alankâras in C. X, shew him to be older than Mammata.")and secondly because Jayamangalâ explains each and every grammatical form very minutely, and analyses it fully. Mallinâtha in this commentary as in others notes not only the points of grammar, but also of Alankara, cites Koshas in support of his meanings, and names and explains metres. As regards knotty points of the philosophy of grammar, apart from those that concern the derivation of forms only Mallinâtha goes very deep. He has. criticized Jayamangalâ in many [places](# "C. III. St. 5, C. V. St. 68  C. I. 26, III. 27, III. 44, V. 27, V. 32, VI. 97, VII, 35 ( by केचित, and पूर्व व्याखातारः) C. IV. 21 (without naming him)."). In one place he has criticized Subodhinikâra [also.](# "C. VII. St. 103.")The fifteenth century is the date





fixed for [Mallinâtha.](# "Vide Dr. Bhandarkar's Preface to the Malatimâdhava and Mr. K. B. Pâthaka's Preface to the Meghadûta.")In this commentary, however, there are two allusions to the Kaumudi (the Siddhânta-Kaumudi of Bhaṭṭoji [Dikshita),](# "There is only one other Kaumudi, the Prakriya Kaumudi of Ramachandra, but the references are not found there.") and as the time of Bhaṭṭoji Dikshita is fixed to be the 17th [century,](# "शेषश्रीकृष्णः भट्टोजिदीक्षितः ( शिष्यः ) शेषवीरेश्वरः (पुत्रः ) पण्डितराजजगन्नाथः ( शिष्यः )  Vide. Introduction to the Rasagangâdhara (N. S. Press). Jagannatha lived in the reign of Shah Jahan and thus the beginning of the 17th century is the time of Bhattoji-Dikshita.") the question arises whether this Mallinatha is identical with the well-known Mallinâtha, the commentator on the famous Mahakavyas. In fact we have to decide three questions. I. Whether Mallinatha, the commenta- tor on the Bhatti-Kavya, is the same as the well-known Malli- natha. II. Whether Mallinâtha lived before Bhaṭṭoji Dikshita or after him. III. Whether the references represent the com- mentator's actual words or whether they are later interpolations. As regards the first question**:—**

 On comparing this commentary with those of Mallinatha on the Raghuvaṁsa, the Kumâra-Sambhava the Meghadûta, the S'is'upâlavadha and the Kirâtârjunîya, I am convinced that the two persons are identical. I find the same references to the Kâs'ikâ, Vâmana and Nyâsakara, the same definitions of figures of speech mostly drawn from Vidyânâtha's Pratâparudra, the same allusions to Dandin, and quotations from the same Koshas, Amara, Yàdava, Vis'va, Bhaṭṭamalla. Moreover the commentator on the Bhaṭṭi-Kâvya himself shews his identity with the well-known Mallinâtha by alluding to his commentary Ghantāpatha twice **( 'इत्यादि प्रपञ्चितमस्माभिः किरातार्जुनीयव्याख्याने** **घण्टा–**





**पथेऽर्थगौरवमित्यत्रोपरम्यते'** C. I., St. 6, and **'अभिवादिदृशोरात्मनेपद** **उपसंख्यानादणिकर्त्तुर्वा कर्मत्वं तदेतदस्माभिर्घण्टापथे स सन्ततं दर्शयते गतस्मय इत्यत्र** **यथाभाष्यं सम्यग्विवेचितमित्यस्माभिर्नात्र भरः कृतः** ' C. XIV, St. 54), SanjÎvini on the Raghuvamśa **(रामायणविरोधस्तु पुराणभेदात्परिहृतोऽस्माभिः** **रघुवंशसंजीविन्यामेव '** C. I., St. 25), and Sanjîvinî on the Kumârasambhava ("**ऊकारादप्यूङ् वक्तव्यः' इति ऊङन्तत्वात्सुभ्रुशब्दस्य नदीत्वात्संबुद्धौ नदीन्हस्व इति** **प्रपञ्चितमन्यत्र”** by **अन्यत्र** he means **कुमारसंभवसंजीविन्याम्,** and the reference is found there C. V. St. 43). We also find the same name **महोपाध्यायकोलाचलमल्लिनाथसूरि.** The word **माल्य** is derived in the same way in the Bhaṭṭi - Kâvya 2. 26 and the KirâtarjunÎya 1. 21. All the above circumstances leave no ground to doubt his identity with the well-known Mallinâtha, unless we were to hazard a conjecture, a conjecture which has not the slightest argument to stand upon, that the commentator on the Bhaṭṭi-Kâvya not only assumed the name and the surname of Mallinatha, imitating him so very cleverly and exactly in every respect as to pass for him, but he was also so very dishonest that he proved his own identity by speaking of Mallinâtha's commentary on the Kirâtârjunîya, the Raghuvams'a and the Kumarasambhava as his own. It is thus proved that the two Mallinâthas are not two distinct persons, but one and the same.

 With regard to the second question whether Mallinâtha flourished before Bhaṭṭoji DÎkshita or after him, it has already been mentioned before that Mallinâtha is assigned to the fifteenth century and Bhaṭṭoji Dikshita to the 17th century. If Mallinâtha flourished after Bhaṭṭoji Dîkshita, we should find some allusion to the Siddhântakaumudî in any one of the many [passages](# "रघु० ' सोऽह माजन्मशुद्धानाम् ' १,५ ( K. p. 15), ' रघूणामन्वयं वक्ष्ये' १, ९ ( K. p. 117), ' स बभूवोपजीविनाम् ' १,१६ (K, p. 303), 'धुर्यान् विश्रामय' १, ५४ ( K. p. 214 ) • विस्मापयन् विस्मितमात्मवृत्तौ ' २, ३३ ( K. p. 259), ' अमुं पुरः पश्यसि देवदारुम्' २, ३ ६ (Ma.

sambhava, the Meghadûta, The KÎrâtarjunÎya, the Śiśupâlavadha in the Kaumudî and the Manoramâ**.** Moreover though there are so many passages quoted from the Bhaṭṭi-Kâvya in the Kaumudî and the Manoramá ( vide foot-note p. x. ), no references ( are given in the commentary except in two places C. I. St. 23, and C. VIII. St. 16. As Mallinâtha frequently quotes from the Kasi'kâ and follows it as in explaining the forms **सुतानुबन्धि** १. १० (taking **इनि** and not **णिनि )** and **उपायंसत** **१. १६** ( taking **स्वकरण** to mean **पाणिग्रहण** as in the Vṛitti and not **स्वीकार** as in the Siddhânta-Kaumudî ), and as some of his readings, such as **‘कास्यनेकाज्ग्रहणं 'चुलुम्पाद्यर्थम्,’** & Vārtika on **“कास्प्रत्ययादाममन्त्रे लिटि”** ३\।१\।३५\।\। and ‘**डच्प्रकरणे संख्यायास्तत्पुरुषस्योपसंख्यानं** **कर्त्तव्यं निस्त्रिंशाद्यर्थम्'** a Vârtika on **“बहुव्रीहौ संख्येये डजबहुगणात्”** ५।४।३॥ are found to agree with those of the Kâs'ikâ and not of the Kaumudî, and as notwithstanding so many quotations from the well-known five Mahâkâvyas and from the Bhaṭṭi-Kavya, Mallinâtha does not refer to the Kau,

mudi or the Manorama for any of them except for the two passages noted above, nay in some cases (as in **‘हा पितः क्वासिहे सुभु’** VI. 11, **‘सुतानुभन्धि’** I. 10) actually solves the difficulty either in the way adopted by the Vṛittikâra or in some way other than the one followed by Bhaṭṭoji Dîkshita, it is quite clear that Mallinåtha lived before Bhaṭṭoji Dîkshita.

 Thus with regard to the third question as to whether the two references to the Siddhanta-Kaumudi are the author's own references or whether they are later interpolations, the answer is quite clear that they must be considered as interpolations. They may have been originally marginal notes of some copyist and afterwards inserted into the com- mentary. It is also to be remembered that it is only from two manuscripts that the text of the commentary is settled. I tried my best to see whether these references are correct by comparing them with the text of the commentary as found in other manuscripts; but I failed, as copies of the commentary of Mallinâtha are found only in the Southern parts and there too they are rare. With regard to these references, however, my conclusion is found to be correct. I have been able to secure a copy of the commentary of Mallinâtha on C. VIII. St. 16 from another manuscript in charge of the Theosophical Society of Madras and I found that it was in every respect the same as what is printed in this work with this exception that the reference to the Kaumudi **(‘कौमुद्यां तु समो गम्यृच्छिभ्यामिति पाठः। तदा** **तत्रत्यवार्त्तिकेनात्मनेपदम्’),** was omitted there. It must also be noted that the same Sûtra " **“समो गम्यृच्छि—”**is mentioned by Mallinâtha in preceding verses (C. V. St. 19, C. V. St. 37) as found in the Kâśikâ and not in the Kaumudi and there no remark is made as in C. VIII. St. 10 as to the difference of the readings as found in the Vṛitti and the Kaumudt. It is thus very probable, almost certain, that this reference to the Kaumudi is spurious. As regards the second reference to the Kaumudi (C. I. St. 23) I have secured, through the untiring efforts of my friend, Prof. Râdhâkrishṇa, a copy of the commentary of Mallinâtha from another manuscript at Udamal pet, in which the reference to the Kaumudî is omitted. I therefore.





conclude that the commentator on Bhatti is the same Mallinâtha that has commented upon the Raghuvams'a, the Kumârasambhava, the Meghadûta, the Kirâtârjunîya, and the S'is'upâlavadha, that he flourished before Bhaṭṭoji Dîkshita and that the two references to the Siddhântakaumudî in the commentary are interpolations.

**NOTES.**  
![](../books_images/U-IMG-1726541777Screenshot2024-09-17082739.png)  

**CANTO I.**

Stanza 1–

 A Mahâkâvya must open with a benedictory stanza, or a salutation-stanza, or one specifying the subject–matter of it. '**आशीर्नमस्त्क्रियावस्तुनिर्देशो वापि तन्मुखम्**' (*vide* Intro). Premachandra in his commentary on Kâvyâdarśa explains **वस्तुनिर्देश**as meaning ‘narration ofthe hero or one connected with him.' '**वसति प्रस्तुतवृत्तान्तोऽस्मिन्नितिवस्तु प्रबन्धनायकः अपरो वा तत्सम्बन्धी तस्य निर्देश उपन्यासः**' But Malli.takes it to mean 'narration of the subject–matter.' '**दशरथस्य सत्तारूपंवस्तु काव्यार्थबीजत्वेन निर्दिशति**' (*vide* Com.). Śiśupâlavadha and Kumâra-sambhava also open with **वस्तुनिर्देश**. In his Sarvanṅkashâ (Com. onMâgha) Malli. says '**काव्यफलं शिशुपालवधबीजभूतं भगवतः श्रीकृष्णस्यनारददर्शनरूपं वस्तु आदौ श्रीशब्दप्रयोगपूर्वकं निर्दिशन् कथामुपक्षिपति.**' We donot think it necessary to take **वस्तु** in the sense of **नायक** or **तत्सम्बन्धी**.

 The word **विबुध** is formed from the root **बुध्**by the Sùtra **“इगुपधज्ञाप्रीकिरः कः"** ३।१।१३५॥Roots having **इक् (इ, उ, ऋ**, short or long and**ऌ)** for their penultimate, and **ज्ञा, प्री** and **कॄ**take the termination**क** (*i.e.***अ, क्** being **इत्** by "**लशक्कतद्धिते**" १।३।८॥) in the sense of thedoer. The termination being **कित्** is weak, *e.g.***क्षिपतीति क्षिपः, लिखतीतिलिखः, बुध्यतीति बुधः, कृश्यतीति कृशः, जानातीति ज्ञः, प्रीणातीति प्रियः, किरतीतिकिरः. ण्वुल् (अक)** and **तृच् (तृ)** are also added to these roots as toothers in the same sense. They are strong terminations. *e.g.***क्षेपकः, क्षेप्ता; लेखकः, लेखिता; ज्ञायकः, ज्ञाता** &c.

 **द्विषन्तप** and **परन्तप** To **तापि**, the causal base of **तप् खच् (अ)** isaffixed in the sense of the doer, when **द्विषत्** or **पर** is its **उपपद** (*i. e.* isprefixed to it). **तापि** shortens its penultimate and drops **इ. अरुष्,द्विषत्,** and words ending in a vowel have **मुम् (म्)** added to them whenthey are prefixed to a root to which **खश्** or **खच्** is to be added. **अभ्रंलिह, अरुन्तुद, ललाटन्तप, प्रियंवद, वशंवद, वाचंयम, पुरन्दर, सर्वंसह, सर्वङ्कष,कूलङ्कष, अभ्रङ्कष, भयङ्कर, विश्वम्भर, अरिन्दम,** and **पतिंवरा** are among thewords thus formed.

 **सनातनः तन** is affixed to **साय, चिर** (changed to **सायम्** and **चिरम्**),**प्राह्ण, प्रग** (changed to **प्राह्णे**and **प्रगे**), and to adverbs shewing time, in the



sense of ‘pertaining to' **सायंचिरंप्राह्णेप्रगेऽव्ययेभ्यष्ट्युट्युलौ तुट्च ४।३।२३॥ प्राह्णप्रगयोरेदन्तत्वं निपात्यते. अव्ययेभ्य इत्युक्तावपि सायंचिरंशब्दयोः पृथग्ग्रहणमकारान्तानव्ययसायचिरशब्दयोर्मान्तत्वनिपातनं द्योतयति *e.g.* सायन्तन, चिरन्तन,प्राह्णेतन** (relating to the forenoon), **प्रगेतन** (relating to the morning)**दोषातन,** **दिवातन, अद्यतन, इदानीन्तन** &c.

 **स्वयम्** = Of his own accord, without being incited by another. **'स्वयमित्यात्मना न कर्मणान्येन वा प्रेरित इत्यर्थः' (जय०).**

 There is inconsistency between the two ideas conveyed by **सनातनः**(primeval, eternal) and **पितरमुपागमत्** (approached Daśaratha as father,was born of him); but this inconsistency is only apparent, as it can beexplained away by the fact that the greatness of Vishnu is incomprehensible. A figure of speech, in which there is apparent inconsistency which can be reconciled by some circumstance or by construingthe passage in another way, is called **विरोधाभास**, which is definedby Vidyânâtha in Pratâparudra as '**आभासत्वे विरोधस्य विरोधाभास इष्यते.**'Mammata calls it **विरोध** and defines it as **'विरोधः सोऽविरोधेऽपि विरुद्धत्वेनयद्वचः**.’ In the present case the antithesis may be explained away bythe fact that he was born to extricate the world from the thorn ofRâvana. **(भुवनहितच्छलेन)** The Gîtâ says:–

'परित्राणाय साधूनां विनाशाय च दुष्कृताम्।  
धर्मसंस्थापनार्थाय संभवामि युगे युगे॥'

 **जगण** should not be used in the beginning of a composition; butif it is followed by **भगण** or if the first word be designative of a deityor auspiciousness, it is not objectionable to use it. The Śiśupâlavadha also opens with **जगण**, but Malli.comments upon it asfollows:– **'तत्रादौ श्रीशब्दप्रयोगात् वर्णगणादिशुद्धेरभ्युच्चयः। तदुक्तम्। "देवतावाचकाः शब्दा ये च भद्रादिवाचकाः। ते सर्वे नैव निन्द्याः स्युर्लिपितो गणतोऽपिवा ॥" इति.'**

 The metre of the verse is **रुचिरा**, also called **प्रभावती,** consisting of**जगण, भगण, सगण, जगण** and a long letter and having the *yati* or cæsuraafter four and nine letters. **(चतुर्थग्रहैः).**

**Stanza 2–**

 **त्रिदश.** In the Sarvaṅkashâ, Malli, thus explains it:– **'तिस्रो दशाबाल्यकौमारयौवनानि जन्मसत्तावृद्धयो वा येषां ते** (that is, free from old age ordestruction) **यद्वात्रिर्दश परिमाणमेषां ते त्रिदशाः'** Other ways of explainingthe word are as follows:–



 'त्रीन् तापान् दशतीति त्रिदशः। घञर्थे संज्ञायां कर्त्तरि कः। अथवा व्यधिकास्त्रिरावृत्ताश्च दश परिमाणमेषां ते त्रिदशाः। डच् समासान्तः। शाकपार्थिवादित्वादधिकावृत्तशब्दलोपः। एकस्यैव त्रिशब्दस्य तन्त्रतयोच्चारणादुभयार्थपरत्वम्। अयमेवपक्षः श्रुत्यनुगुणः। त्री च दश चेति छान्दोग्येऽभिहितत्वात्। त्र्यधिकावृत्तपरताद्योतनार्थं त्रीचेति द्विवचनान्ततया निर्देशः। ते च देवाः। अर्का द्वादश रुद्रा एकादशवसवोऽष्टौ अश्विनौ द्वाविति। अश्विनीकुमारौ विहाय इन्द्रः प्रजापतिश्चेति वा द्वाभ्यां पक्षान्तरे संख्यापूरणम्॥'

 **पितॄनपारीत्** = Satisfied the Manes.'**पितॄनपारीदाप्यायितवान्। पितरमुद्दिश्ययजनम्। “पृ पालनपूरणयोः" इत्यस्मात्पूरणार्थाल्लुङि रूपम्' (जय०). अपारीत्**and **अतार्प्सीत्** are synonymous. Mark Malli.'s explanation of **अतार्प्सीत्**'gratified the Manes by offerings, and by the progeny which was toresult from them. By studying the Vedas, performing sacrifices to Gods,and gratifying the Manes by generating children, Daśaratha becamefree from three debts, which all have to pay off, *viz*., debt to sages,debt to Gods, and debt to the Manes. c*f*. '**जायमानो वै ब्राह्मणस्त्रिभिर्ऋणवा जायते ब्रह्मचर्येणर्षिभ्यः यज्ञेन देवेभ्यः प्रजया पितृभ्यः' (आश्व०)**

'ऋषिदेवगणस्वधाभुजां श्रुतयागप्रसवैः स पार्थिवः।  
अनृणत्वमुपेयिवान् बभौ परिधेर्मुक्त इवोष्णदीधितिः॥' Raghu 8. 30.

 Bhaṭṭoji notices **पितॄनतार्प्सीत्**. On **तृप प्रीणने** he says **'प्रीणनं तृप्तिस्तर्पणाच। नाग्निस्तृप्यति काष्ठानाम्। पितॄनतार्प्सीदिति भट्टिः। इत्युभयत्र दर्शनात्।**

** सममंस्त. 'येषां सिचइकार उच्चारणार्थस्तेषां "हनः सिच्" इति कित्करणज्ञापकान्नलोपाभावः। येषां तु इकार इत् तेषामिदित्त्वान्नकारलोपाभावः' (जय०).**Malli. takes the latter view, as also Bha, Dî. who says '**इचावितौ’(सिद्धां० कौ०), and 'इचाविति तत्रेदित्त्वे प्रयोजनममंस्तेत्यत्र "अनिदिताम्–" इत्युपधालोपाभावः' (मनो०)**.

 **षड्वर्ग**=The collection of six internal enemies of mankind, known as**षड्रिपु**. They are **'कामः क्रोधस्तथा लोभो मदमोहौ च मत्सरः**' Bhâravi callsthem **अरिषड्वर्ग**. See Kirâ.:—

'कृतारिषड्वर्गजयेन मानवीमगम्यरूपां पदवीं प्रपित्सुना।  
विभज्य नक्तंदिवमस्ततन्द्रिणा वितन्यते तेन नयेन पौरुषम्॥ १. ९.

** नीतौ =** In the adoption of one of the four means of success or oneof the six courses of action against an enemy. The *Up*â*y*â*s* are **सामन्** (conciliation), **दान** (bribery), **भेद** (sowing dissensions), and **दण्ड** (attack),The *Guṇas* are **संधि** (peace), **विग्रह** (war), **यान** (march), **आसन** (halt)**संश्रय** (taking shelter), and **द्वैधीभाव** (duplicity).



 **समूलघातम्**. It is used as an adverb. It is formed by adding **णमुल्(अम्)** to **हन्** (changed to **घात्**) with **समूल** as a prefix as itsobject. The formation is according to the Sûtra "**समूलाकृत- जीवेषुइन्कुञ्ग्रहः**" **(३।४।३६॥).** **णमुल्** is affixed to **हन्, कृ**, and **ग्रह्** with **समूलअकृत**, and **जीव** as *Upapadas* respectively as their objects. **समूलघातंहन्ति (समूलं हन्ति), अकृतकारं करोति (अकृतं करोति), जीवग्राहं गृह्णाति(जीवं जीवन्तं गृह्णाति).**

 Malli. says that in this work one *śabdâlaṅkâra* consisting of **प्रयोगवैचित्र्य** (variety of peculiar grammatical forms) is to be found inalmost each and every verse. In his Sarvaṅkashá also he considers**प्रयागेवैचित्र्य** as an Alaṅk*â*ra. **'अत्र कर्त्रभिप्राये "णिचश्च" इत्यात्मनेपदेसिद्धेऽपि प्रयोगवैचित्र्यस्याप्यलंकारत्वादकर्त्रभिप्रायेऽपि "णेरणौ यत्कर्मणौ चेत्सकर्त्तानाध्याने" इत्यात्मनेपदं वदन्ति' माघ.१२.५.** In his Ghantpâ

tha also hetakes the same view. **'अत्र तादर्थ्यचतुर्थ्यामपि न दोषः तथापि प्रयोगवैचित्र्यविशेषस्याप्यलंकारत्वादेवं व्याचक्षते' किरा.१.३.** The *arthâlaṅkâra* in thisverse is **समुच्चय,**which is defined by Vidy*â*n*â*tha as **'गुणक्रियायौगपद्यंसमुच्चय उदाहृतः'** The simultaneity of properties and actions is called**समुच्चय.** The following instance is given to illustrate the simultaneousnessof properties:–

'प्रतापरुद्रनृपतौ भद्रासनमुपेयुषि।  
सतां प्रसन्नं हृदयमसतां कलुषं मनः॥'

 Here **प्रसाद** and **कालुष्य** take place simultaneously. The followingverse illustrates the simultaneousness of actions:–

'प्रेक्षते इमां नरेन्द्रो प्रविशति मदनोगलति मानश्च।  
घूर्णति मनश्च शून्यं किमेतत्पश्यत सख्यः॥'

 In the text the simultaneity of actions, studying the Vedas, performing sacrifices to gods &c., is described.

**Stanza 3–**

 **व्यकारीत् = दत्तवान् विक्षिप्तवानिति वा.**

** वनवत्.** The student should note that there are two terminations**वत्** used in two ways. One is the substitute of **मत्** and is generally apossessive termination. The word to which it is added is used as anadjective. **"तदस्यास्त्यस्मिन्निति मतुप्” ५।२।९४॥ गावोऽस्यास्मिन्वा सन्ति गोमान्।'अस्तीति पुरुषवचनेऽविवक्षिते। कालस्तु विवक्षित एव। इतिशब्दो विषयविशेषलाभार्थःतथाहि**

**'भूमनिन्दाप्रशंसासु नित्ययोगेऽतिशायने।  
संसर्गेऽस्तिविवक्षायां भवन्ति मतुबादयः॥'**



'अस्तिविवक्षायां ये मतुबादयो विधीयन्ते ते भूमादिषु विषयेषु भवन्तीति वार्त्तिकार्थः।भूमा बहुत्वं तच्च आपेक्षिकम्। यस्य हि यावदुचितं तावदेव स्वशब्देनापि प्रतीयते यथापञ्चषाभिरपि गोभिर्देवदत्तस्य बह्व्योगाव इति व्यवहारः राज्ञस्तु सहस्रगोभिरपिगावोऽल्पा इति॥' (मनो०).

** यवमान्, ककुदावर्त्तिनी कन्या, रूपवान्, क्षीरिणो वृक्षाः, उदरिणी,** and **दण्डी** areinstances of **मत्** and other possessive terminations designating **भूमन्,निन्दा, प्रशंसा, नित्ययोग, अतिशायन,** and **संसर्ग** respectively.

 **भूम्नि। यवमान्। प्रचुरयवविशिष्ट इत्यर्थः। 'इह यवमतीभिरद्भिर्यूषं प्रोक्षतीत्यादौजातिमात्रसंबन्धस्य विवक्षितत्वाद्भूमाभावेऽपि मतुप्। भूमादिग्रहणं हि प्रायेण भूमादयोऽपिप्रतीयन्त इत्येवंपरम्। निन्दायां ककुदावर्त्तिनी कन्या। प्रशंसायां रूपवान्। नित्ययोगेक्षीरिणो वृक्षाः। अतिशायने उदरिणी कन्या। संसर्गे दण्डी। संसर्गः संयोगः तेनसंयुक्त एवोच्यते न तु गृहावस्थिते दण्डेऽपि'। (मनो०)**

 Another **वत्** has three uses. It is used in the sense of 'like'. Theword to which it is added is used as an adverb and is connected witha verb. **"तेन तुल्यं क्रिया चेद्वतिः" ५।१।११५॥. 'तुल्यमिति सामान्ये नपुंसकंयत्तुल्यं सा चेत्क्रियेत्यर्थः' *e.g.* ब्राह्मणवदधीते ब्राह्मणेन तुल्यमधीते। 'ब्राह्मणशब्दस्तस्कर्त्तृकेऽध्ययने लक्षणया वर्त्तते ब्राह्मणकर्त्तृकाध्ययनतुल्यमध्ययनं वाक्यार्थः'.** Thus**ब्राह्मणवदधीते** means **'**his study is like the study of a Brâhmana', theword **ब्राह्मण** being used not in its primary sense, but in the secondarysense of the study of a Brahmana.**'क्रिया चेदिति किम्। गुणतुल्ये माभूत्।पुत्रेण तुल्यः स्थूलः.** Here we can not say **पुत्रवत् स्थूलः.** On **गुणतुल्ये माभूत्** Bha. Dî. remarks in the Manoramâ–**'गुणतुल्ये इति अक्रिययातुल्य इत्यर्थः। अत एव महानसवदिति वतेः साधुत्वरक्षणार्थं प्रतिज्ञावाक्ये वह्निमान्भवितुमर्हतीत्यादिक्रियापदं प्रयुञ्जते वृद्धाः। अर्वाचीनास्तु महानससदृशपर्वत इतिव्याचक्षाणाः सूत्रविरोधादुपेक्ष्याः'।** It is not strictly correct to say **पर्वतोवह्निमान्** **महानसवत्**, for here **महानसवत्** is not connected with a verb.The correct expression is **पर्वतो वह्निमान् भवितुमर्हति महानसवत्.** Here**महानसवत्** will be connected with the verb **भवितुमर्हति.** The objectionthat the first sentence *viz*, **पर्वतो वह्निमान् महानसवत्,** conveys thesense clearly, is thus refuted:–**'ननु तद्रीत्या व्युत्पन्नस्य तादृशबोधोऽप्यनुभवसिद्ध इति चेत् सत्यं तादृशेऽर्थे साधुत्वमात्रं निराकुर्मो न तु बोधमपि। तथाहि भेद्यभेदकसंबन्धोपाधिभेदनियन्त्रितं साधुत्वं तदभावेऽपि बाधो नेह निवार्यते। अव्युत्पन्नस्यसाधुभ्योऽप्यबोधात् तत्रैव व्युत्पन्नस्यासाधुभ्योऽपि बोधाच्च कस्मात् किं बुध्यते इतिन नियन्तुं शक्यं किं तु किंविशेष्यके किंप्रकारके किसंसर्गके बोधेऽनुद्देश्ये किं साधुकिं नेत्येव शास्त्रीयविचारविषयः। उक्तं हि भगवता। समानायामर्थावगतौ शब्दैश्चापशदैश्चभक्ष्याभक्ष्यादिवन्नियमः क्रियत इति॥'**



 Another use of **वत्** is that it is added to a word in the sense of'like in', or 'like of'. Here also the word ending in **वत्** is an adverb,but it is not connected with a verb. **"तत्र तस्येव" ५।१।११६॥'मथुरायामिवमथुरावत् स्रुघ्ने प्राकारः। चैत्रस्येव चैत्रवन्मैत्रस्य गावः।'**

 The third sense of **वत्** is 'in a way befitting some thing.' Here theword ending in**वत्** is connected with a verb and is used adverbially.**“तदर्हम्” ५।१।११७॥ 'विधिमर्हति विधिवत्पूज्यते। क्रियाग्रहणं मण्डूकप्लुत्यानुवर्त्तते।तेनेह न। राजानमर्हति छत्रम्।'** It is not correct to say **राजवत् छत्रम्** as **राजवत्**is not connected with a verb.

 **उपास्थित. स्था** with **उप** is Atma. in the sense of 'praising a deitywith *Mantrâs*,' 'adoring a deity' 'uniting,' 'contracting friendship,''leading to' (a way leading to some place) and when it is used intransitively. It is optionally Atma. in the sense of 'desiring to obtain'**“उपान्मन्त्रकरणे” १।३।२५॥ *e.g.* आग्नेय्याग्नीध्रमुपतिष्ठते. “उपाद्देवपूजासङ्गतिकरणमित्रकरणपथिष्विति वाच्यम्" *e.g.* आदित्यमुपतिष्ठते। गङ्गा यमुनामुपतिष्ठते। रथिकानुपतिष्ठते। पन्थाः स्रुघ्नमुपतिष्ठते॥ "अकर्मकाच्च" १।३।२६॥*e.g.* भोजनकाले उपतिष्ठते ॥ “वा लिप्सायामिति वक्तव्यम्" *e.g.* भिक्षुकः प्रभुमुपतिष्ठतेउपतिष्ठति वा।**

 **निरास्थत्. अस्** to throw and **ऊह्**are optionally Atma. when theyare preceded by a preposition. **"उपसर्गादस्यत्यूह्योर्वेति वाच्यम्."**

** **The figures of speech in this verse are **उपमा** (simile) and **समुच्चय** (forwhich see notes on v. 2) Vidyâ. defines **उपमा** as **'स्वतः सिद्धेन भिन्नेनसंमतेन च धर्मतः। साम्यमन्येन वर्ण्यस्य वाच्यं चेदेकदोपमा'॥.**As **उपमा** and**समुच्चय** stand independently of each other like oil and sesamum, thereis **संसृष्टि** of them. The combination of two or more figures of speechin one passage independently of one another is called **संसृष्टि. 'तिलतण्डुलसंश्लेषन्यायाद्यत्र परस्परम्। सांश्लिष्येयुरलङ्काराः सा संसृष्टिर्निगद्यते॥' (विद्या०).**

** महाब्रह्मसमूहजुष्टः.ब्रह्मन्** drops its final **अन्** and takes **अ** at the endof a Tatpurusha compound optionally when preceded by **कु** or **महद्."कुमहद्भ्यामन्यतरस्याम्" ५।४।१०५॥** ***e.g.*****कुत्सितो ब्रह्मा कुब्रह्मः** or **कुब्रह्मा.महान्तश्च ते ब्रह्माणश्च महाब्रह्माः** or **महाब्रह्माणः.**

 **अध्वरे वह्निरभिप्रणीतः=**Consecrated in the sacrifice, being broughtfrom the house-hold fire. The three sacred fires are **गार्हपत्य, आहवनीय,**and **दक्षिण.** Manu describes them as follows:–



'पिता वै गार्हपत्योऽग्निर्माताग्निर्दक्षिणः स्मृतः।  
गुरुराहवनीयस्तु साग्नित्रेता गरीयसी॥' २.२३१.

 **गार्हपत्य** is the sacred fire to be perpetually maintained by a householder. He receives it from his father and transmits it to his descendants. It is from this that sacrificial fires are lighted **आहवनीय** isthe eastern fire burning at a sacrifice. It is taken from **गार्हपत्य. दक्षिण**is the southern fire, used in the monthly *S'râdha* sacrifice, performedin the honour of the Manes on the day of the New Moon. *cf*.

 **'गार्हपत्यादाहवनीयं ज्वलन्तमुद्धरेत्। पिता वा एषोऽग्नीनां यद्दक्षिणः पुत्रो गार्हपत्यःपौत्र आहवनीयः।' आश्व० गृ०.**

 **जज्वाल लोकस्थितये.** When taken with **राजा,** it means 'was wideawake for the protection of his subjects.' When taken with **अग्नि**, itmeans 'as fire burns for the protection of the world' *cf*.,

अग्नौप्रास्ताहुतिः सम्यगादित्यमुपतिष्ठते।  
आदित्याज्जायते वृष्टिर्वृष्टेरन्नं ततः प्रजाः॥(मनु०).

 In this verse the king is compared to Âhavanîya fire,**पुण्यः, महाब्रह्मसमूहजुष्टः,** &c. are adjectives common to both. Thus **राजा** is **उपमेय, अग्नि,उपमान, पुण्यः** &c. are **साधारणधर्म** and **यथा** is **उपमाद्योतक.** All the fouressentials of **उपमा** being **वाच्य** (expressed), it is **पूर्णोपमा**; and it is **श्रौती,**because **यथा, इव** &c. directly bring out the idea of similarity.**'साक्षात्सादृश्यप्रतिपादकेवादिशब्दानां प्रयोगे श्रौती। धर्मिव्यवधानेन सादृश्यप्रतिपादकानांसदृशसंकाशनीकाशप्रतीकाशादिशब्दानां प्रयोगे आर्थी.'

 **शतमन्युकल्पः कल्प, देश्य,** and **देशीय** are terminations added to a wordin the sense of ‘a little short of '. They shew 'proximity to completion'.**"ईषदसमाप्तौ कल्पब्देश्यदेशीयरः" ५।३।६७॥ *e.g.* ईषदूनो विद्वान् विद्वत्कल्पः,यशस्कल्पम्, पचतिकल्पम्, विद्वद्देश्यः, अष्टादशवर्षदेशीयः, पटुदेशीयः.**

 The figure of speech in this verse is **सम** in which there is a combination of suitable objects. Here the suitability between **दशरथ** and**अयोध्या** is described. Daśaratha, who was like Indra, lived in Ayodhyâ,which was like Amarâvatî. As the figure thus depends upon twoUpamâs, the combination is called **संकर**, which means a combinationin a passage of two or more figures depending upon one another,being mixed up like milk and water.' **'क्षीरनीरनयाद्यत्र संबन्धः स्यात् परस्परम्।अलंकृतीनामेतासां संकरः स उदाहृतः॥' (विद्या०)** These are Vâchyâlaṅkâras (expressed figures.). There is also Alaṅkâradhvani (suggestion



of a figure). As it is suggested that Râma beautified Ayodhyâand Ayodhyâ beautified Râma, there is अन्योन्यालंकारध्वनि, and this isअलंकारेण अलंकारध्वनि; because it is the *saṅkara*, of *Sama* and *Upam*â**that suggests *Anyonyâlaṅkâra* which Vidyâ, defines thus—'तदन्योन्यंमिथो यत्रोत्पाद्योत्पादकता भवेत्'

 Malli.'s view expressed in his commentary on *Kirâtârjuniya* on अर्थगौरवम् is as follows:—

 ****'नन्वर्थगौरवमित्यत्र कथं षष्ठीसमासः। "पूरणगुण—" इत्यादिना प्रतिषेधात्।नैष दोषः। ये शुक्लादयः शब्दा गुणे गुणिनि च वर्तन्ते यथा पटस्य शुक्लं शुक्लः पट इतिच तेषामेवात्र निषेधाद्ये च सदा गुणमात्रवचनाः यथा गौरवं प्राधान्यं रसो गन्धःस्पर्श इत्येवमादयस्तेषामनिषेधात्। तथा "तत्स्थैश्चगुणैः षष्ठी समस्यते" इति वचनाद्बहुलमभियुक्तप्रयोगदर्शनाच्च। बलाकायां शौक्ल्यमित्यादौ तु भाष्यकारवचनादसमासः।अत एवाह वामनः—"अत्र पीतिमादिषु गुणवचनसमासो बली स्यात्" इति॥'

 The Sûtra, which is referred to, is “पूरणगुणसुहितार्थसदव्ययतव्यसमानाधिकरणेन” २।२।११॥. The instance of गुणार्थ is 'काकस्य कार्ष्ण्यम्। ब्राह्मणस्यशुक्लाः।.' Bha. Dî says:—'यदा प्रकरणादिना दन्ता इति विशेष्यं ज्ञातं तदेदं('ब्राह्मणस्य शुक्ला' इति ) अनुदाहरणम्। अनित्योऽयं गुणेन निषेधः तदशिष्यं संज्ञाप्रमाणत्वादिति निर्देशात्। तेनार्थगौरवं बुद्धिमान्द्यमित्यादि सिद्धम्'।

 On this the Manoramâ proceeds as follows:—

 The Bhâshya on षष्ठी २।२।८॥runs as follows:—

 ****'तत्स्थैश्चगुणैः॥

 Kaiyaṭa's remarks on तत्स्थैःare as follows:—

 **'तत्स्थैरिति'।** तच्छब्देन संनिधानाद्गुण एवं परामृश्यते। तेनायमर्थः। स्वात्मनि येगुणाः अवस्थितास्तैः सह समासो न च स्वात्मन्यवस्थानं गुणानां संभवति भेदनिबन्धनत्वान्मुख्याधाराधेयभावस्य सर्वस्य च गुणस्य द्रव्याश्रयत्वात्। तस्मादभिधानव्यापारापेक्षया तत्स्थत्वमुच्यते। इह केचिद्गुणाः शब्देन द्रव्यान्निष्कृष्टा एव प्रत्याय्यन्ते न तुद्रव्यस्योपरञ्जकत्वेन। यथा चन्दनस्य गन्ध इति। सर्वदा वैयधिकरण्यमेव गुणगुणिनोःन कदाचिच्चन्दनं गन्ध इति सामानाधिकरण्यं भवति। शुक्लादयस्तु गुणाः कदाचिन्निष्कृष्टरूपाः शब्दैरुच्यन्ते पटस्य शुक्ल इति कदाचिद् द्रव्येणैकत्वमापन्नाः शुक्लः पटइति। तस्माद् द्विविधगुणसद्भावात्तत्स्थैरिति विशेषणं रूपादिगुणपरिग्रहार्थमुपात्तमिति।

 On बलाकायाः शौक्ल्यम् Kaiyaṭa says as follows:—

 ****'अथ बलाकायाः शौक्ल्यमिति समासः कस्मान्न भवति। तत्स्थं हि शौक्ल्यम्।सर्वदा वैयधिकरण्येन संबन्धात्। नैष दोषः। शौक्ल्यशब्देन शुक्लो गुणोऽभिधीयते।शुक्लशब्दस्य द्रव्ये वर्त्तमानस्य तस्मिन्नेव प्रवृत्तिनिमित्ते भावप्रत्ययविधानात्। न चासौतत्स्थः। अभेदाध्यवसायेन द्रव्यं प्रत्यनुरञ्जकत्वदर्शनाच्छुक्लः पद इति। अर्थस्य चतत्स्थत्वमाश्रीयते इति शब्दभेदेऽप्यर्थस्याभेदान्नास्ति शुक्लस्य गुणस्य तत्स्थत्वम्॥'

 On the whole Malli. follows Kaiyaṭa's view that the genitive is notcompounded with words like शुक्ल which are used as adjectives and alsoas nouns (गुण and गुणी).

**सद्रत्नमुक्ताफलवज्रभाञ्जि.**

रत्न means a precious stone. मुक्ताफल(pearls) and वज्र(diamonds) are included in रत्न, they being specialkinds of precious stones. ('नीलकं वज्रकं चेति पद्मरागश्च मौक्तिकम्। प्रवालं चेतिविज्ञेयं पञ्चरत्नं मनीषिभिः'); still they are mentioned separately as ब्राह्मण****and परिव्राजक in the expression ब्राह्मणपरिव्राजकन्याय, or as गो and बलीवर्दin the expression गोबलीवर्दन्याय. ब्राह्मण and परिव्राजक, गो and बलीवर्दstand in the relation of सामान्य (general) and विशेष (particular).मुक्ताफल and वज्रstand in the same relation with रत्न.

 The Jaya. notices सद्रत्नमुक्ताफलवज्रयुञ्जि as another reading.

 ****सद्रत्नमुक्ताफलवज्रभाञ्जि, विचित्रधातूनि**,** and सकाननानि are adjectivesgoing both with मेरोः शिरांसि and गृहाणि.

**हिमाद्रिटङ्कात्.**

The singular is used in the sense of the plural, जातिवाचक names (class–names) are in Sanskrit used either in the singularor in the plural, “जात्याख्यायामेकस्मिन्बहुवचनमन्यतरस्याम्”।१।२।५८॥*e.g.*ब्राह्मणाः पूज्याः। ब्राह्मणः पूज्यः। The sense of the verse is that the raysof the brilliant jewels, with which the walls, and the floors of thehouses were inlaid, coming out from windows, looked like thecurrents of the Ganges (they being white) coming out of the slopesof the Himâlayas.

 Here houses are compared to the slopes of the Himâlayas and therays of jewels to the currents of the Ganges. We have here a comparison between two statements and though one इव is used, गङ्गाम्बुपातप्रतिमाः being equal to गङ्गाम्बुपाता इव**,** the figure is अनेकेवा वाक्यार्थोपमा. Daṇdî defines वाक्यार्थोपमा as follows:—

'वाक्यार्थेनैव वाक्यार्थः कोऽपि यद्युपमीयते।  
एकानेकेवशब्दत्वात् सा वाक्यार्थोपमा द्विधा॥"

 The followinginstances illustrate एकेवा वाक्यार्थोपमा and अनेकेवावाक्यार्थोपमाः—

'त्वदाननमधीराक्षमाविदर्शनदीधिति।  
भ्रमद्भृङ्गमिवालक्ष्यकेसरं भाति पङ्कजम्॥'  
'नलिन्या इव तन्वङ्ग्यास्तस्याः पद्ममिवाननम्।  
मया मधुव्रतेनेव पायं पायमरम्यत॥'

 Compare also the following verse for अनेकेवा वाक्यार्थोपमाः—

"ततः प्रतस्थे कौबेरीं भास्वानिव रघुर्दिशम्।  
शरैरुस्रैरिवोदीच्यानुद्धरिष्यत् रसानिव॥"(रघु० ४; ६६).



 On this Malli says:—****'अनेकेनेव शब्देनेयमुपमा। यथाह दण्डीः—

"एकानेकेवशब्दत्वात् सा वाक्यार्थोपमा द्विधा॥" इति॥'

**धर्म्यासु**

= not away from religion, religious, holy, purifying. The wordis formed from धर्म by the addition of यत्. “धर्मपथ्यर्थन्यायादनपेते”****४।४।९२॥*e.g.* धर्मादनपेतं धर्म्यम्। पथ्यम्। अर्थ्यम्। न्याय्यम्. The wordqualifies both पत्नीषु and विद्यासु. धर्म्यासु (पत्नीषु) pure; because practisingreligion with their husbands according to the dictates of the *S'rutis*and the *Smritis*, धर्म्यासु (विद्यासु) purifying, teaching religion.

 

**अधिगतासु काले.**

The time for commencing learning and enteringupon family–life for different castes is thus described by Yâjṅyavalkya:—

राज्ञामेकादशे सैके विशामेके यथाकुलम्॥  
उपनीय गुरुः शिष्यं महाव्याहृतिपूर्वकम्।

वेदं व्रतानि वा पारं नीत्वा ह्युभयमेव वा॥  
अविप्लुतब्रह्मचर्यो लक्षण्यां स्त्रियमुद्वहेत्।”(याज्ञ० ३;५१–५२).

**पुत्रीयता.**

****A denominative is formed from a noun in the sense of'wishing it of one's self' by adding to it क्यच् (य). If the base to which.is affixed क्यच् ends in अ, अ is changed to ई, and if it ends in any othervowel, it is lengthened. काम्यच् (काम्य) is also added in the samesense. The base so formed is conjugated in all the tenses and takes Para.terminations. आत्मनः पुत्रमिच्छति पुत्रीयति or पुत्रकाम्यति. It should benoted that क्यच् can not be added to पुत्र in the sense of राज्ञः पुत्रमिच्छति.

 क्यच् has another sense also. It is added to an उपमान in the objective or locative case in the sense of 'behaving. '(उपमानादाचारे ३।१।१०॥अधिकरणाच्चेति वक्तव्यम्) *e.g.* पुत्रीयति (पुत्रमिवाचरति) छात्रम् (He actstowards a pupil as towards his sons), प्रावारीयति कम्बलम्, विष्णूयति द्विजम्,प्रासादीयति (प्रासादे इवाचरति) कुट्याम्, पर्यङ्कीयति मञ्चके, कुटीयति प्रासादे.काम्यच् is not added in this sense.

 If the उपमान is the agent of the action of behaving, क्यङ (य is):added to it in the sense of 'behaving' (कर्त्तुः क्यङ् सलोपश्च ३।१।११॥)



The base ending in क्यङ् takes Atma. terminations. Before क्यङ् the preceding vowel is lengthened, and स् dropped necessarily in thecase of ओजस् and अप्सरस् and optionally in the case of other wordsending in स्. ('ओजसोऽप्सरसो नित्यमितरेषां विभाषया') *e.g.*श्येनायते (श्येनइवाचरति) काकः, कृष्णायते, ओजायते (ओजस् is to be understood in thesense of ओजस्विन्. 'ओजःशब्दो वृत्तिविषये तद्वति'), अप्सरायते, यशायते orयशस्यते, विद्वायते or विद्वस्यते.

 ****क्विप् is added to all nouns in the sense of क्यङ् ('सर्वप्रातिपदिकेभ्यः क्विप् वावक्तव्यः') क्विप् is wholly dropped. The base is to be considered as a &root of the 1st conjugation. It takes Para.takes Para. terminations *e.g.*कृष्णति (कृष्ण इवाचरति), दिनन्ति यामिन्यः (Nights act like days), as inthe following verse:—

'सविता विधवति विधुरपि सवितरति तथा दिनन्ति यामिन्यः।  
यामिनयन्ति दिनानि च सुखदुःखवशीकृते मनसि॥'

 

विपक्त्रिमज्ञानगतिः.

'विपक्त्रिमज्ञानगतिरिति विपाकेन निर्वृत्तं यत्पूर्वजन्मकृतमनिवर्त्तनीयं कर्म तस्योग्रतपःप्रत्ययाद्विनोपदेशाज्ज्ञानात्प्रवृत्तिर्बुद्धावस्य जातेत्यर्थः'जय०.

 This makes the dissolution of the compound complicated. It maybe dissolved as follows:—विपक्त्रिमं च तत् ज्ञानं च विपक्त्रिमज्ञानं तस्य गतिराश्रयःthat is, he was the resort of perfected knowledge. This will give itthe same sense as that of विपक्त्रिमज्ञाननिधिः the reading adopted byमल्लिनाथ.

 विपक्त्रिम**,** and दत्रिम**,** and विहित्रिम (in St. 13) are formed byaffixing त्रिम. It is added to roots that are mentioned in the Dhâtupâthawith the initial डु in the sense of तेन (धातुवाच्यभावेन) निर्वृत्तम्. Theinitial डु is इत् by "आदिर्ञिटुडवः" १।३।५॥डुपचष् पाके, डुलभष् प्राप्तौ, डुभृञ्धारणपोषणयोः, डुदाञ् दाने, डुधाञ् धारणपोषणयोः, डुकृञ् करणे, and डुक्रीञ् द्रव्यविनिमये are among the roots of this kind.

 

**ऋष्यशृङ्गः**

. Malli.'s reading is ऋश्यशृङ्गः ऋश्य and ऋष्य both mean 'awhite-footed antilope.' ऋष्यशृङ्ग is the more general form. This isthe form of the word used by Malli. himself in Raghu. "ऋष्यशृङ्गादयस्तस्य सन्तः सन्तानकाङ्क्षिणः। आरेभिरे जितात्मानःपुत्रियामिष्टिमृत्विजः॥”रघु०.१०.३. On this Malli. says "ऋष्यशृङ्गो नाम कश्चिदृषिः तदादयः."

**कृतात्मा.**

Jaya. explains it as वशीकृतात्मेति भावः,



 

**क्रतुम्.**

क्रतु is here used in the sense of इष्टि. The following verseshews the difference between क्रतु, इष्टि and यागः—

"इष्टिस्तु चरुणा प्रोक्ता यागस्तु पशुना स्मृतः।  
एतच्छेषः क्रतुः प्रोक्तो होमान्यत् पूजनं स्मृतम्॥"

 

**ज्ञाताशयस्तस्य**

means ज्ञाततदाशयः. It is like श्रुतदेहविसर्जनः पितुः, whichmeans श्रुतपितृदेहविसर्जनः. When a word is connected with a dependentmember of a compound, it should be put in the compound. तस्य andपितुः are connected with आशय and देहविसर्जन**,** which are both dependent as the compounds are बहुव्रीहि (अन्यपदार्थप्रधानो बहुव्रीहिः). Theyshould therefore have been included in the compounds. In theirpresent forms, the compounds are सापेक्ष, their dependent membersbeing connected with तस्य and पितुः which are not included in them.****'समर्थानां पदविधिः' २।१।१॥precludes सापेक्ष words from being compounded(सापेक्षमसमर्थं भवति).

'सापेक्षे प्रत्ययो न स्यात् समासो वा कथञ्चन।  
सापेक्षं तद्विजानीयादसमस्तविशेषणम्॥'

 If the सापेक्ष word is the principal word in a compound, the compoundis allowed. 'यदि सापेक्षमसमर्थं भवतीत्युच्यते राजपुरुषो दर्शनीयः अत्र वृत्तिर्नप्राप्नोति। नैष दोषः। प्रधानमत्र सापेक्षम्। भवति च प्रधानस्य सापेक्षस्यापि समासः।'But if the सापेक्ष word is a dependent member of a compound, the compound is not allowed. Then how are 'देवदत्तस्य गुरुकुलम्' 'देवदत्तस्य गुरुपुत्रः''देवदत्तस्य दासभार्या' (where देवदत्तस्य is connected with गुरु and दास)'किमोदनः शालीनाम्' (*i.e.*केषां शालीनामोदनः), 'सक्त्वाढकमापणीयानाम्'(*i.e.* आपणीयानां सक्तूनामाढकम्) to be explained? These are to beconsidered correct; because they are गमक, that is, they convey thesense that is desired to be conveyed by a sentence. 'इह समानार्थेन वाक्येनभवितव्यं समासेन च।' 'गमकत्वात्समासः' means 'the compound is formedbecause it clearly conveys the desired sense, the sense that can beconveyed if the compound were not formed and words used uncompounded.'

 

**सुतानुबन्धि.**

Malli. says it is formed by the addition of इनि (इन्)a possessive affix, to सुतानुबन्ध. सुतस्य अनुबन्धः सुतानुबन्धः सोऽस्यऽस्मिन्वाअस्तीति सुतानुबन्धि. It is not formed by affixing णिनि (इन्) whichshews ताच्छील्य (habit, nature) by the Sûtra 'सुप्यजातो णिनिस्ताच्छील्ये'३।२।७८॥ for though the word 'सुपि' can be supplied from a precedingSûtra, it is mentioned to shew that it can not be added to a root to



which a preposition is prefixed. Malli. follows the view taken byVṛittikára who says: 'सुपीति वर्त्तमाने पुनः सुब्ग्रहणमुपसर्गनिवृत्त्यर्थम्' Inhis commentary on खविचारिणः C. 5, St. 13 also, Malli. takes the sameview. But this does not seem to be the sound view. In his explanation of the Sûtra Bha Dî, criticizes the view as follows:—

He refers to the Vártika 'कप्रकरणेमूलविभुजादिभ्य उपसंख्यानम्' on the Sûtra ‘तुन्दशोकयोः परिमृजापनुदोः' ३।२।५॥.मूलविभुजादि is an आकृतिगण, that is, it is not a limited list, but anyword of a similar form may be considered as belonging to the list.

 

लक्ष्मणेन सह शत्रुघ्नं प्रासोष्ट.

The Sutra “सहयुक्तेऽप्रधाने" २।३।१९॥teaches that the word in the instrumental case connected with सह isअप्रधान (subordinate). Malli. says that this subordination is only शाब्द(verbal). The word सह shews that words joined by it are to be simultaneously construed with the verb with which they are connected. Thusin the present case सह shews that the प्रसव of लक्ष्मण and शत्रुघ्न was समकालीन. Lakshmaṇa's seniority to Śatrughna is therefore in no way harmed.

 Bha. Di's remarks on this Sútra are as follows:—

 'सहार्थेन युक्तेऽप्रधाने तृतीया स्यात्। पुत्रेण सहागतः पिता' (सिद्धा० कौ० )

**तत्त्वानि**

The twenty–five elements recognised by the Sâṅkhyas. The following verse enumerates them and shews their nature:—

'मूलप्रकृतिरविकृतिर्महदाद्याःप्रकृतिविकृतयः सप्त।  
षोडशकस्तु विकारो न प्रकृतिर्न विकृतिःपुरुषः॥'

** **मूलप्रकृति or प्रकृति (Nature) is the creator of the world. It is theprimary germ out of which all material appearances have been evolved.It is otherwise called प्रधान. It is the creator of the world, but it isnot itself created and is therefore called अविकृति. It is inanimate, andconsists of the three qualities सत्त्व, रजस्, and तमस्. It creates महत् orthe great principle, also known as बुद्धि or अन्तःकरण. महत् producesअहंकार, which in its turn gives rise to five *Tanmâtras* (शब्द, स्पर्श, रूप,रस, and गन्ध). महद्, अहंकार, and पञ्च तन्मात्र are both creators andcreated and are therefore प्रकृतिविकृतयः. The five *Tanmâtras* produceपञ्च महाभूत (पृथ्वी, अप्, तेजस्, वायु, and आकाश) and अहंकार producesमनस्, the five ज्ञानेन्द्रिय (organs of perception, श्रोत्रत्वक्चक्षूरसनाघ्राणानि)and the five कर्मेन्द्रिय (organs of action, वाक्पाणिपादोपस्थपायवः). Theपञ्च महाभूत, the पञ्च ज्ञानेन्द्रिय, the पञ्च कर्मेन्द्रिय, and मनस् are thesixteen *Vikâras*; because they are created, but themselves create noelements, पुरुष or the soul is the twenty–fifth element. It neither



creates any thing nor is itself created. It is simply the passive lookeron of the actions of *Prakṛiti*. प्रकृतिः कर्त्री जडा पुरुषस्तु उदासीनः साक्षीपुष्करपलाशवन्निर्लिप्तः. 'महाभूतैः शरीरमुत्पाद्यते तत्संबन्धवशात् प्रकृतिरेव सर्वंकरोति। तत्संसर्गवशादात्मनोऽहंकरोमीत्यभिमानो जायते। स एवात्मनो बन्ध इत्युच्यते। तन्निवर्त्तनाच्च मोक्ष इत्याहुः॥' सिद्धा० चन्द्रो०.

**द्विषद्वीर्यनिराकरिष्णुः**

= Habituated to disdain the valour of enemies.इष्णुच् (इष्णु) is added to अलंकृ, निराकृ, प्रजन्, उत्पच्, उत्पत्, उन्मद्, रुच्,अपत्रप्, वृत्, वृध्, सह्, and चर् in the sense of शील (habit, disposition).(अलंकृञ्निराकृञ्प्रजनोत्पचोत्पतन्मदरुच्यपत्रपवृतुवृधुसहचर इष्णुच् ३।२।१३६॥).As the Sûtra “न लोकाव्ययनिष्ठाखलर्थतृनाम्” २।३।६९॥ prohibits the use of thegenitive case with words, the suffixes of which end in उ (*e.g.* हरिं दिदृक्षुःअलंकरिष्णुर्वा), Malli. takes the compound as द्वितीयातत्पुरुष. ('द्विषद्वीर्यंनिराकरिष्णुः'). It should, however, be remembered that the Sûtraprohibits the use of कारकषष्ठी and not of शेषे षष्ठी ('सर्वोऽयं कारकषष्ठ्याःप्रतिषेधः। शेषे षष्ठी तु स्यादेव। ब्राह्मणस्य कुर्वन्। नरकस्य जिष्णुः।' सिद्धा० कौ०).The Bhâshyakâra comments on शेषे षष्ठी as follows:—

 'शेष इत्युच्यते। कः शेषो नाम। कर्मादिभ्यो येऽन्येऽर्थाः स शेषः। यद्येवं शेषो नप्रकल्पते। न हि कर्मादिभ्योऽन्येऽर्थाः सन्ति। इह तावद्राज्ञः पुरुष इति राजा कर्त्तापुरुषः संप्रदानम्। वृक्षस्य शाखेति वृक्षः शाखाया अधिकरणम्। तथा यदेतत्स्वं नामचतुर्भिरेतत्प्रकारैर्भवति क्रयणादपहरणाद्याच्ञाया विनिमयादिति। अत्र च सर्वत्र कर्मादयःसन्ति॥एवं तर्हि कर्मादीनामविवक्षा शेषः। कथं पुनः सतो नामाविवक्षा स्यात्।सतोऽप्यविवक्षा भवति। तद्यथा। अलोमिकैडका। अनुदरा कन्येति। असतश्च विवक्षाभवति। समुद्रः कुण्डिका। विन्ध्यो वर्धितकमिति॥'

 It will thus be seen that in every instance of the genitive case,the word in the genitive case, is connected with some action expressedor understood. The genitive case shews relation (संबन्ध) andBhartṛihari defines it as follows:—

'संबन्धः कारकेभ्योऽन्यः क्रियाकारकपूर्वकः।  
श्रुतायामश्रुतायां वा क्रियायां सोऽभिधीयते॥'

 On this Kaiyaṭa remarks as under :—

 ****'तत्राश्रुतायां क्रियायां राज्ञः पुरुष इत्यादौ क्रियाकारकसंबन्धपूर्वकोऽन्य एव स्वस्वामिभावादिकः संबन्धः प्रतीयते। मातुः स्मरतीत्यादौ श्रूयमाणे क्रियाशब्दे सदपि कर्मत्वमविवक्षित्वा विशेषणभाव एव स्मरणं प्रति मातुः प्रतिपाद्यते॥'

  Thus शेष simply means the desire of not expressing the relation of कर्म and other Kârakas, even though the relation exists. Kaiyaṭa



says:—'क्रियाकारकसंबन्धोऽपि सर्वत्र वस्तुस्थित्यास्ति तन्निमित्तश्च स्वस्वामिभावादिरपितत्र स्वस्वामिभावादिविवक्षायां सन्नपि क्रियाकारकसंबन्धो न विवक्ष्यते.'

 On असतश्च विवक्षा &c. Kaiyaṭa remarks:—दृष्टान्तरूपेणेदमुपात्तम्।असतो यथा विवक्षा तथा सतोऽप्यविवक्षेत्यर्थः। समद्रः कुण्डिकेति। कुण्डिकायांबहुपानीयसंभवप्रतिपादनाय समुद्रत्वमारोप्यते। विन्ध्यो वर्धितकमिति। वर्धितकशब्देनमूले स्थूलमग्रे सूक्ष्मं विशिष्टसंस्थानयुक्तं भक्तमुच्यते। तस्य महत्त्वप्रतिपादनाय विन्ध्यत्वमसदारोप्यते॥'

 Taking शेषे षष्ठी the compound द्विषद्वीर्यनिरांकरिष्णुः may be taken asषष्ठीतत्पुरुष. Jaya. takes it as such 'द्विषतां वीर्यं सामर्थ्यम्।.......तस्य निराकरिष्णुः'जय०.

 Jaya notices अहंयुनाथः as another reading and comments upon itas follows:—

 वयम् is used in the sense of अहम्. The plural forms of अस्मद् areoptionally used in the sense of the singular or the dual number; butwhen they are qualified by an adjective, the plural is not used, 'सविशेषणस्य प्रतिषेधः' (वा०). पटुरहं ब्रवीमि॥' (सिद्धा० कौ०). It should be notedthat this adjective should be अनुवाद्य (attributive) and not विधेय (predicative). 'अनुवाद्यविशेषणेऽयं निषेधो न विधेये।. It is for this that पदमञ्जरीकारsays:– "कथं 'त्वं राजा वयमप्युपासितगुरुप्रज्ञाभिमानोन्नताः' इति। अत्रोन्नतत्वंविधीयते। न हि विधेयोऽर्थो विशेषणं भवति॥".

**विप्रवह्निः.**

Jaya takes it as उपमितसमास. 'विप्रो वह्निरिव। "उपमितम्–"इति समासः' But in this case विप्र becomes the principal word in thecompound and it can not be so well connected with धक्ष्यति as वह्नि. वह्निshould therefore be the principal word in the compound and for thisthe compound should be solved like मयूरव्यंसक. Malli. is therefore moreaccurate than Jaya. in solving the compound as विप्रः एव वह्निः विप्रवह्निः.

 

**ततोऽनुजज्ञे गमनं सुतस्य.**

Our commentator's reading is ततोऽनुमेनेगमनं सुतस्य.In this case नृपः can be connected actively with अनुमेने, andno विभक्तिविपरिणाम (change of case) is necessary. But the true readingseems to be the one adopted in the text. Malli. notices it and shewshow it is discussed in the Siddhântakaumudî. ज्ञा takes Atma.terminations when not preceded by a preposition (अनुपसर्गाज्ज्ञः१।३।७६॥).अनुजज्ञे should, therefore, be taken passively, गमनम् in the nominativecase, and नृपः changed to नृपेण by विभक्तिविपरिणाम to be construed withअनुजज्ञे. The Siddhântakaumudî on this Sûtra runs as follows:–

 ****'गां जानीते। अनुपसर्गात्किम्। स्वर्गं लोकं न प्रजानाति। कथं तर्हि भट्टिः"इत्थं नृपः पूर्वमवालुलोचे ततोऽनुजज्ञे गमनं सुतस्य" इति। कर्मणि लिट्। नृपेणेतिविपरिणामः॥'

 It should be noted that the Sûtra is given to shew that ज्ञा isAtma. even when it is transitive, provided no preposition is prefixed to it. ('अकर्मकाच्च इत्येव सिद्धे वचनमिदं सकर्मकार्थमिति ध्वनयन्नुदाहरतिगां जानीते इति' मनो०). When intransitive ज्ञा takes Atma. terminations even when preceded by a preposition. ("अकर्मकाच्च" १।३।४५॥ सर्पिषोऽनुजानीते).

**दीप्रास्रधनुः**

A Bahuvrîhi ending in धनुस् takes the terminationअनङ् (धनुषश्च ५।४।१३२॥). In other words धनुस् is changed to धन्वन् atthe end of a Bahuvrîhi compound. *e.g.* शार्ङधन्वा, अधिज्यधन्वा. But theterminations added at the end of compoundsare optional.धनुस्



is not therefore changed to धन्वन् here. 'अथ कथं "स्वलावण्याशंसाधृतधनुषमह्नाय तृणवत्" इति पुष्पदन्तः। समासान्तविधेरनित्यत्वात्। अनित्यत्वेप्रमाणं तु अंश्वादिगणे राजन्शब्दस्य पाठः। स हि "प्रतेरंश्वादयस्तत्पुरुषे" (६।२।१९३॥)इत्यन्तोदात्ततार्थः। "राजाहःसखि–" इति टचो नित्यत्वे तु किं तेनेति दिक्' (मनो०).

 The changes which words undergo at the end of compounds are notobligatory, *i.e.* are not to be found in each and every case. (समासान्तविधिis अनित्य). They may be some times dispensed with. The authorityfor looking upon समासान्तविधि as अनित्य is the fact that the word राजन्is given in the Gaṇa beginning with अंशु. (अंशु, जन, राजन्, उष्ट्र, खेटक, अजिर, आर्द्रा, श्रवण, कृत्तिका, अर्धपुर इत्यंश्वादिः). It is included in theclass to show that it is अन्तोदात्त. But if the समासान्तविधि is नित्य andराजन् takes टच् (is changed to राज) necessarily, then it being चित् (च्of टच् being इत्), it is अन्तोदात्त (चितः। ६।१।१६३॥), and it should nothave been included in the अंश्वादिगण ('राजशब्दः समासान्तस्यानित्यत्वाद्यदाटच् नास्ति तदा प्रयोजयति। तस्मिन्हि सति चित्त्वादेवान्तोदात्तत्वं सिद्धम्।' काशि०).

 नम्र, दीप्र, and हिंस्र are formed from नम्, दीप्, and हिंस् by the affix रadded to them in the sense of 'agent accustomed to do the actiondenoted by the verb or doing it as his duty or doing it well' ('नमिकम्पिस्म्यजसकमहिंसदीपो रः। ३।२।१६७॥नम्रं काष्ठम्। कम्प्रा शाखा।स्मेरं मुखम्। अजस्रं जुहोति। कम्रा युवतिः। हिंस्रं रक्षः। दीप्रं काष्ठम्।अजस्रमिति जसु मोक्षणेनञ्पूर्वो रप्रत्ययान्तः क्रियासातत्ये वर्त्तते। काशि०.

Banks naturally put forth the splendour of water–lotuses by the blooming of land–lotuses in the *S'arad*season. This natural fact is conceived by the poet to be caused by thejealousy felt by the banks on finding their own splendour taken awayby waters, (in as much as they were) marked by the reflection oftrees growing on them.

 This figure of speech is *Utprekshâ*(Poetic Fancy) or the conception of the identity of the Upameya with the Upamâna. 'संभावनमथोत्प्रेक्षा प्रकृतस्य परेण यत्' मम्म० (प्रकृतस्योपमेयस्य परेणोपमानेन सह तादात्म्येनेति शेषः).

 Jaya, takes

उपारुरोद

as transitive 'रोदनक्रियया आक्रन्दनविशिष्टया कुमुद्वत्याईप्सिततमत्वात् रुदिः सकर्मकः।'. Malli. takes it as intransitive and explainsकुमुद्वतीमुपारुरोद as equal to कुमुदतीमुद्दिश्य उपारुरोद. Thus कुमुद्वतीम् is theobject of उद्देशक्रिया which is not expressed, but which can be inferred(गम्यमान). 'न केवलं श्रूयमाणैव क्रिया निमित्तं कारकभावस्यापि तु गम्यमानापि'न्यासोद्योत.

सुगन्धः.

The Sûtra "गन्धस्येदुत्पूतिसुसुरभिभ्यः" ।५।४।१३५॥teaches thatगन्ध is changed to गन्धि at the end of a Bahuvrîhi compound whenpreceded by उद्, पूति, सु, and सुरभि. There is a *Vârtika* on it 'गन्धस्येत्वेतदेकान्तग्रहणम्.' एकान्त is explained in two ways. 'एकान्त एकदेश इव अविभागेन लक्ष्यमाण इत्यर्थः। सुगन्धि पुष्पं सलिलं वा। सुगन्धिर्वायुः। नेह शोभना गन्धाःद्रव्याणि अस्य सुगन्ध आपणिकः' (सिद्धा० कौ०). That is गन्ध is changed to गन्धिin the sense of smell and not in the sense of perfume or fragrant substance. Another explanation of एकान्त is स्वाभाविक. That is, when thefragrance is natural and not borrowed, गन्ध is changed to गन्धि. In the



text we have सुगन्ध;because the fragrance is not natural, but isacquired. On this Vârtika the Manoramâ proceeds as follows:–

 

"द्रव्याणीति।

अस्ति च गन्धशब्दो द्रव्यवचनः। 'वहति जलमियं पिनष्टि गन्धानियमियमुद्ग्रथते स्रजो विचित्राः' (मुद्रा०) इति दर्शनात्। 'गन्धस्तु सौरभे नृत्ये गन्धकेगर्वलेशयोः। स एव द्रव्यवचनो बहुत्वेपुंसि च स्मृतः' इति कोशाच्च। एतेन 'महीभृतःपुष्पसुगन्धिराददे' 'भग्नबालसहकारसुगन्धौ' (माघ १०.३) इत्यादि व्याख्यातम्।एतच्च सर्वं हरदत्तग्रन्थे स्पष्टम्। केचित्तु तदेकान्तशब्देन स्वाभाविकत्वं विवक्षित्वाआगन्तुकस्य नेत्याहुः। तथा च भट्टिः 'आघ्रायिवान् गन्धवहः सुगन्धः' इति। व्याख्यातंच जयमङ्गलायाम्। “गन्धस्येदुत्पूतिसुसुरभिभ्यः" इतीकारः समासान्तो न। गन्धस्येत्वंतदेकान्तग्रहणमिति वचनात्। सुगन्ध आपणिक इति यथा' इति। अत एव 'भग्नबालसहकारसुगन्धौ' इत्यादीनां प्रामादिकत्वं दुर्घटं वृत्तिकृतोक्तम्॥”.

 The Bhâshya on this Sûtra runs thus:–

 

"गन्धस्येदुत्पूतिसुसुरभिभ्यः।

गन्धस्येत्त्वे तदेकान्तग्रहणम्। गन्धस्येत्त्वेतदेकान्तग्रहणं कर्त्तव्यम्। इह मा भूत्। शोभना गन्धा अस्य सुगन्ध आपणिक इति। अथानुपलिप्ते कथं भवितव्यम्। यदि तावद्यदनुगतं तदभिसमीक्षितं सुगन्धि इति भवितव्यम्। अथ यत्प्रविशीर्णं सुगन्ध इति भवितव्यम्"।.

 Kaiyaṭa's notes on this Bhâshya are as under:–

 “गन्धशब्दोऽस्ति द्रव्यवाची। गन्धान्पिनष्टीति। अस्ति च गुणवाची चन्दनगन्धइति। तत्र गुणवाचिग्रहणार्थमाह

गन्धस्येत्व इति।

 Malli.takes एकान्त in the sense of स्वाभाविक. His note on 'गजदानसुगन्धिना' ('सैन्यपरिभोगेण) Raghu. 4. 45 is worth marking:–

 “सुगन्धिना सुरभिगन्धिना। 'गन्धस्य–' इत्यादिनेकारादेशः समासान्तः। यद्यपिगन्धस्येत्वे तदेकान्तग्रहणं कर्तव्यमिति नैसर्गिकगन्धविवक्षायामेवेकारादेशः तथापिनिरङ्कुशाः कवयः। तथा माघकाव्ये 'ववुरयुक्छदगुच्छसुगन्धयः सततगास्ततगानगिरोऽलिभिः' (६।५०)। नैषधे च 'अपां हि तृप्ताय न वारिधारा स्वादुः सुगन्धिःस्वदते तुषारा' (३।९३) इति। न कर्मधारयान्मत्वर्थीय इति निषेधादिनिप्रत्ययपक्षोऽपि जघन्य एव॥".

 In another place (C. 5. 46 of Magha. 'कण्डूयतः कटभुवं करिणो मदेनस्कन्धं सुगन्धिमनुलीनवता नगस्य।' &c.) Malli. says:–'गन्धस्येत्त्वे तदेकान्तग्रहणं नाद्रियन्ते कवयः।'.

 Malli. says ‘अत्र गात्रकर्मणि नृत्तत्वारोपाद्रुपकालङ्कारः’. We should rather take this as an instance of अतिशयोक्ति, as the उपमेय, गात्रकर्म, is not mentioned at all. It is निगीर्ण (swallowed up) in the उपमान, नृत्त. This is therefore अतिशयोक्ति, which is defined by Vidyâ as ‘विषयस्यानुपादानाद्विषय्युपनिबध्यते। यत्र सातिशयोक्तिः स्यात्कविप्रौढोक्तिजीवितम्॥’

आरात्

 मेघात्ययोपात्तबलोपशोभम्, which is Malli's reading as well as that of a few other Mss. conveys better sense than that of

मेघात्ययोपात्तवनोपशोभम्

as वन is almost निरर्थक.

 

वातमज

= A kind of deer; literally & deer running towards the wind, a very swift deer. It is formed like प्रियवंद by affixing खश् (अ) to अज्.

 Lines of swans, that are naturally as white as Kunda flowers, were concealed in collections of white lotuses and on sandy banks mixed with foam. A doubt therefore naturally arose owing to the similarity of whiteness, asto whether they were swans or lotuses, whether they were swans or sandy banks mixed with foam. This doubt was removed by the charming notes of swans. This is निश्चयान्त संदेह,a figure of speech in which doubt ends in certainty. There is alsoअलङ्कारेण अलङ्कारध्वनि
as in C. I. St. 5 *(vide* notes). The figure संदेह suggests another figure, known as सामान्य, in which the object described is shewn to be identical with another, owing to similarity of properties. ‘सामान्यं गुणसाम्येन यत्र वस्त्वन्तरैकता.’ प्रता०.

 This verse is quoted by Mammata, and Viśvanâtha as an instance of एकावली, a figure of speech, in which each succeeding term qualifies the one that immediately precedes it either in an assertion or a negation. The definition of it given by Malli. seems to have been quoted from Pratâpa-rudra. The reading found in the Poona copy of the work (‘यत्रोत्तरोत्तरेषां स्यात्पूर्वं पूर्वं प्रति क्रमात्। विशेषणत्वकथनमसावेकावली मता॥’) is better than that of Malli. The instances given by Vidyâ. are as follows:—

 ‘प्रतापरुद्रनगरी सुजनैरुपशोभिता। सुजना स्फीतविभवैर्विभवा स्थैर्यशालिनः॥’ एतत्स्थापनेनोदाहरणम्। अपोहनेनापि भवति। ‘न तद्राज्यं प्रजा यत्र न भवन्त्यूर्जितश्रियः। न ताः प्रजाः प्रभुर्यासां न स्वयं काकतीश्वरः॥’. The verse in the text is an instance of the latter sort. In this जल is qualified by पङ्कज,पङ्कजby षट्पद, षट्पद by गुञ्जन and गुञ्जन by मनोहरण in negative clauses.

 This verse is quoted in Subhâshitâvali, as belonging to भट्टि (*vide* Dr. Peterson's edition of it, No. 1819). It is given in S'árṅgadharapaddhati as belonging to भर्त्तृस्वामिन्*(vide* Dr. Peterson's edition No. 3904).

It is true that ग्रह् does not occur in the Kârikâ of द्विकर्मक roots given in the Bhâshya; but old grammarians *have* considered it as a द्विकर्मक root.'दुह्याच्यर्थरुधिप्रच्छचिब्रूशासुजिकर्मयुक्। नीहृकृष्मन्थवहदण्ड्ग्रहमुष्पचकर्मभाक्॥'.Bha.

जामदग्न्य.

The word is formed from जमदग्नि by affixing यञ् (य) by"गर्गादिभ्यो यञ्" ४\।१\।१०५॥. जमदग्नि falls under the group beginning withगर्ग. But the termination is added in the sense of गोत्र ("अपत्यं पौत्रप्रभृतिगोत्रम्" ४।१।१६२॥ — *i e.* descendants beginning with grandson) and not of अपत्यin general. The son of गर्ग is गार्गिः, grandson or later offspringगार्ग्यः. How then can जामदग्न्य mean, son of जमदग्नि? The Kâsíkâanswers the question thus:— 'गोत्रं इत्युच्यते। अपत्यसामान्ये भविष्यति। कथमनन्तरो रामो जामदग्न्यः, व्यासः पाराशर्य इति। गोत्ररूपाध्यारोपेण भविष्यति। अनन्तरापत्यविवक्षायां तु ऋष्यणैव भवितव्यं जामदग्नःपाराशर इति॥’. By 'ऋष्यण्' a reference is made to the Sûtra "ऋष्यन्धकवृष्णिकुरुभ्यश्च" ४\।१\।११४॥ according to whichवासिष्ठ, वैश्वामित्र, and other words are formed by affixing अण् to the names of sages.

उक्षांप्रचक्रुः

. is the reading of all the Mss. collated by us except D. and E.Henceउक्षान् प्रचक्रुः adopted by Jaya. does not seem to be the
reading of the author. It seems to have been got up to obviate the
difficulty of प्र coming between उक्षां and चक्रुः, In “कृञ्चानुप्रयुज्यते लिटि”३।९।४०॥ the object of using अनु is to prevent the intervention of any word between आम् and कृञ् (कृ, भू, and अस्), and to prevent the inversion of order. “विपर्यासनिवृत्त्यर्थं वा। विपर्यासनिवृत्त्यर्थं तहिं कृञोऽनुप्रयोगवचनं क्रियते। ईहांचक्रे। चक्रे ईहामिति मा भुत्। व्यवहितनिवृत्त्यर्थं चकृञोऽनुप्रयोगवचनं क्रियते। अन्वेव च कृञोऽनुप्रयोगो यथा स्यात्‌।ईहांचक्रे।व्यवहितस्य मा भूदिति।ईहां देवदत्तश्चक्रे इति॥' महाभाष्य.

Malli. however holds that the intervention of an उपसर्गdoes not make the form incorrect. Râmânanda, who has written मुग्धबोध on भट्टि, is of the same view:—“भ्वस्क्रन्वाम्” इति सूत्रे आम इति पञ्चम्यैवेष्टसिद्धौ अनुग्रहणं उपसर्गक्रियाविशेषणव्यवधानेऽपि तदनुप्रयोगज्ञापनार्थम्।.’ क्रमदीश्वर makes the Sûtra ‘सप्रादिकृभ्वस्तिभिश्च’ and instances उक्षां प्रचक्रुः to illustrate the Sûtra, सुबोधकार says:— ‘सत्यमुपसर्गेऽव्यवधानम्’ Bhâshyakâra says nothing about the intervention of a preposition. The instance he gives is that of the intervention of a word other than a preposition. न्यासकारalso gives a similar instance:—‘याचयां देवदत्तश्चकारेत्यत्र मा भूदिति’ Hemâdri in his Darpana on Raghu. On ‘तं पातयां प्रथममास’ says:—‘सारस्वतटीकायां कासामि त्यामन्तमव्ययम्।’ “क्राद्यन्तश्च” इत्यत्रामन्तमव्ययमित्युक्तत्वात्। पृथक्पदाञ्चक्रे इति त्वनुप्रयोगः। तेन व्यवधानेऽपि प्रयोगोघटते। “यस्य येनान्वययोग्यता तस्य तेन दूरस्थेनापि भवति" इति न्यायात्। ततः ‘प्रभ्रंशयां यो नहुषं चकार' इत्यादि नविरुध्यते॥’.

विद्युत्प्रणाशं प्रनष्टः.

विद्युत्प्रणाशम् ends in णमुल् (अम्) affixed to नश् according to the Sûtra “उपमाने कर्मणि च” ३।४।४५॥ which means that णमुल् is added to a root when its उपपद is a standard of comparison (उपमान) as subject or object of the action denoted by the root. घृतनिधायं निहितः is equal to यथा घृतं निधीयते तथा निहितः, घृतमिव निहितः. Here the उपपद घृत is an उपमान and object of निधीयते. अजकनाशं नष्टः means यथा अजकः नश्यति तथा नष्टः, अजक इव नष्टःHere the उपपद अजक is an उपमान and subject of नश्यति. विद्युत्प्रणाशं प्रनष्टः means यथा विद्युप्रणश्यति तथा प्रनष्टः By ”कषादिषु यथाविध्यनुप्रयोगः” ३।४।४६॥ the same root is used as that to which णमुल् is affixed after these forms. Hence रैपोषं पुष्णाति, हस्तग्राहं गृह्णाति, चूर्णपेषं पिनष्टि &c. The Com. reads प्रणष्टः. Most of the Mss. adopt the same reading. But प्रणष्टः is अपाणिनीय, The Sûtra “नशेः षान्तस्य” ८।४।३६॥ teaches that the न् of नश् is not changed to ण्when नश् ends in ष or has its श् changed to ष (अन्तग्रहणं षान्तभूतपूर्वमात्रस्यापि यथा स्यात्). In प्रनष्टः, परिनष्टः, प्रनङ्क्ष्यति, परिनङ्क्ष्यति, न् can not be changed to ण्. The reading प्रणष्टः found in most of the Mss. seems to have been a slip of copyists. But it is strange that Malli. says“उपसर्गादसमासेऽपि णोपदेशस्य”इत्युभयत्रापि णत्वम्." By उभयत्र he clearly means in विद्युत्प्रणाशम् and प्रणष्टः. But even here उभयत्रापि may have been interpolated by a copyist. For Malli. himself reads ‘प्रनष्टविनयेनाग्र्यः’ (C.IX,St.108) and quotes the Sûtra “नशेः षान्तस्य” ८।४।३६॥ to explain प्रनष्ट. The form प्रणष्ट may be considered as आर्ष. It is found in some works as in ‘तेन प्रणष्टमैन्द्रं तदस्मद्व्याकरणं भुवि। जिताः पाणिनिना सर्वे मूर्खीभूता वयं पुनः॥' कथास० ४.२५.

 

ऊर्ध्वशोषं विशुष्कः.

This is also णमुल्, शुष्and पूर् have णमुल् added to them when theirउपपद is ऊर्ध्व as subject of the actions denoted by



these roots. ऊर्ध्वशोषं शुष्यति means ऊर्ध्वं शुष्यति. ऊर्ध्वपूरं पूर्यतेis equal toऊर्ध्वं पूर्यते ; ‘ऊर्ध्वमुख एव घटादिर्वर्षोदकादिना पूर्णो भवतीत्यर्थः' (सिद्धा० कौ०).

अस्राक्षुः.

In explaining this form both Malli, and Jaya. seem to err. Malli says:—'कुत्वादिकार्यम्.' Jaya says:— ‘"चोः कुः"। "खरि च" इति चर्त्त्वम्.' Both of them thus change the ज् of सृज् to क् before सिच्. Though the form may be thus explained, it is not correct. According to the Sûtra "व्रश्वभ्रस्जसृजमृजयजराजभ्राजछशां षः" ८।२।३६॥ the ज् of सृज् must be changed to ष्before सिच्. The ष्is then changed to क् by "षढोः कः सि" ८।२।४९॥. The स् of सिच् being changed to ष्, we have अस्राक्षुः. Malli. should therefore have said 'षत्वादिकार्यम्' instead of 'कुत्वादिकार्यम्' as the Sûtra "चोः कुः" ८।२।३० is applicable to those roots that do not come under व्रश्चादि. The form अयाक्षीत् C.I.St.12 is correctly explained by both. There Jaya. says:— 'षत्वकत्वे.' This should have been similarly explained.

 

कवोष्णम्.

कु is changed to का, कव, or कद् when compounded with उष्ण. कु has here the sense of ईषत्. ईषदुष्णं कोष्णं, कवोष्णं, कदुष्णं वा.

 

पराङ्मुखैस्ते न्यवृतन् मनोभिः.

‘They returned with their minds turned backwards, that is, towards Râma.' पराङ्मुखैर्मनोभिः is equal to पराङ्मुखैर्मनोभिरुपलक्षिताः. The use of the instrumental case is to be explained by the Sûtra "इत्थंभूतलक्षणे" २।३।२१॥ as in 'लताप्रतानोहथितैः स सकेशैरधिज्यधन्वा विचचार दावम्' रघु० २.८.

ससीतयो राघवयोरधीयन्.

अधीयन्Nom. Sing. of इ with अधि 2nd Conj. Para. 'to remember.’This root is always used with the preposition अधि like इ with अधि 2nd Conj. Atma. 'to study.' 'इक् स्मरणे। अयमप्यधिपूर्वः। अधीगर्थदयेशामिति लिङ्गात्। अन्यथा हीगर्थेत्येव ब्रूयात्’। सिद्धा० कौ०. Jaya, says:— 'अधीयन् स्मरन्। इक् स्मरण इत्यस्य शतरि रूपम्। यणादेशः. But if we have यणादेशः, that is, if इ is changed to य्, we should have अधियन्, not अधीयन्. Malli's 'इयङादेशः' is therefore correct. It is true that according to some अधियन्तिis the 3rd Per. Plu. But to explain



अधीयन् we must change इ to इय् and not य्. The point is discussed in the Siddhântakaumudî. “इण्वदिक इति वक्तव्यम्”। अधियन्ति। अध्यगात्। केचित्तु आर्धधातुकाधिकारोक्तस्यैवातिदेशमाहुः। तन्मते यण् न। तथा चभट्टिः। 'ससीतयोराघवयोरधीयन्निति। सिद्धा० कौ०. The second view seems to be better. The Sûtra "आर्धधातुके" २\।४\।३५॥ is an Adhikâra Sûtra up to "ण्यक्षत्रियार्षञितो यूनि लुगणिञो"२।४।५८॥. "इण्वदिक इति वक्तव्यम् " is a Vârtika on “इणो गा लुङि "२।४।५४॥ which is within the अधिकार, and the instances given in the Kâśikâ and the Bhâshya are all connected with आर्धधातुक or non-conjugational forms. "इणो गा लुङि” २।५।४५॥ 'इण्वदिकः॥ इण्वदिक इति वक्तव्यम्। इहापि यथा स्यात्। अध्यगात्। अध्यगाताम्। अध्यगुः॥ णौगमिरबोधने॥२।४।४६॥ इण्वदिक इत्येव। अधिगमयति। अधिगमयतः। अधिगमयन्ति॥ सनि च॥ २।४।४७॥ इण्वदिक इत्येव। अधिजिगमिषति। अधिजिगमिषतः। अधिजिगमिषन्ति'॥ भाष्य.

 

राघवयोरधीयन्.

The genitive is to be explained by the Sûtra "अधीगर्थदयेशां कर्मणि” २।३।५२॥. Roots having the sense of अधीक् (स्मृ), दय्, and ईश् take the genitive of the object when the object is not desired to be so expressed. There is अनुवृत्ति of शेषे in the Sûtra, and so when it is intended to express the object as such, the accusative is used.'भातरं स्मरति', 'स्मरसि सुरसनीरांतत्र गोदावरीं वा' (उत्त०). 'शेषे इति वर्त्तते। शेषश्च कः। कर्मादीनामविवक्षा शेषः। यदा च कर्म विवक्षितं भवति तदा षष्ठी न भवति। तद्यथा। स्मराम्यहं मातरम्। स्मराम्यहं पितरमिति। भाष्य.

Malli, shews his own अरूचिof this view by using the wordकेचित्; perhaps because he thinks that when the word can be derived by the help of Pâṇini's Sûtras, it is not necessary to have recourse to the Vârtika. The Vârtika only teaches that यत् is the affix and not ण्यत् in जन्य. 'जनेर्यद्विधिः स्वरार्थः। ण्यतापि रूपसिद्धेः। न च वृद्धिप्रसंगः। "जनिवध्योश्च" (७।३।३५॥) इति निषेधात्।' सिद्धा० कौ०.

The तत्पुरुष compound ending in उपज्ञा and उपक्रम is neuter, provided what is being known and what is being begun is intended to be expressed as first. ‘पाणिन्युपज्ञं ग्रन्थः’ means पाणिनिना प्रथममुपज्ञातः, ‘पाणिन्युपज्ञमाकालापकं व्याकरणम्’ = ‘पाणिनेरुपज्ञानेन प्रथमतः प्रणीतमाकालापकं व्याकरणम्’ ‘नन्दोपक्रमाणि मानानि’ = नन्दैः प्रथममुपक्रान्तानि. ‘नन्दोपक्रमं द्रोणः,’ ‘दर्शनीयोपक्रमं सुकुमारम्.’ ‘लोकेऽभूद्यदुपज्ञमेव महतां सौजन्यजन्यं यशः’Malli. But if what is known or begun is not intended to be expressed as first, the rule does not apply; *e. g.* ‘देवदत्तोपज्ञो रथः’‘यज्ञदत्तोपक्रमो रथः’.

 

‘केकय्युपज्ञं बत बह्वनर्थम्’

= This levity first observed (not observed in any one else before) in केकयी is alas attended by many evils.

राघवलक्ष्मणाभ्याम्.

राघव and लक्ष्मण have various senses. 'राघवोऽब्धेर्महामीनभेदे च रघुवंशजे' (मेदि०), also 'राघवोऽब्धिझषान्तरे रघुजेऽपि' अनेका०.of हेम०. 'लक्ष्मणा त्वौषधिभेदे सारस्यामपि योषिति। रामभ्रातरि पुंसि स्यात् सश्रीके चाभिधेयवत्॥' (मेदि०). 'लक्ष्मणश्चैव सारसः।' अमरमाला. When a word has more than one sense, the particular sense in which it is to be taken is settled by संयोग, विप्रयोग, साहचर्य &c, which are mentioned in the following verses:—



**'संयोगो विप्रयोगश्च साहचर्यं विरोधिता।  
अर्थः प्रकरणं लिङ्गं शब्दस्यान्यस्य संनिधिः॥  
सामर्थ्यमौचिती देशः कालो व्यक्तिः स्वरादयः।

 The story is mentioned in the Uttarakânda of the Râmâyaṇa. Daṇda was theyoungest of the hundred sons of Ekshvâku, son of Manu. As he was very foolish, his father called him Danda, foreseeing that he would have to suffer punishment for his folly one day. 'मूढश्चाकृतविद्यश्चन शुश्रूषति पूर्वजान्। नाम तस्य च दण्डेति पिता चक्रेऽल्पतेजसः। अवश्यंदण्डपतनं शरीरेऽस्य भविष्यति॥' He was made king of the country between Vindhya and Śaivala. In this barren region he founded a town and called it Madhumat. Once he went to the hermitage of Bhârgava.There he fell in love with Arajâ, the daughter of the sage. She said:—'मा मां स्पृश बलाद्राजन् कन्या पितृवशा ह्यहम्। गुरुः पिता मे राजेन्द्र त्वं च शिष्यो महात्मनः। व्यसनं सुमहत्क्रुद्धः स ते दद्यान्महातपाः। यदि वान्यन्मया कार्यंधर्मदृष्टेन सत्पथा॥ वरयस्व नरश्रेष्ठ पितरं मे महाद्युतिम्। अन्यथा तु फलं तुभ्यं भवेद्धोराभिसंहितम्॥' But he could not restrain his passion, but outraged her. The sage, knowing the incident, cursed him. 'सप्तरात्रेण राजासौ सपुत्रबलवाहनः। पापकर्मसमाचारो वधं प्राप्स्यति दुर्मतिः॥ समन्ताद्योजनशतं विषयं चास्य दुर्मतेः। धक्ष्यते पांसुवर्षेण महता पाकशासनः॥ सर्वसत्त्वानि यानीह स्थावराणि चराणि च। महता पांसुवर्षेण विलयं सर्वतोऽगमन्॥ दण्डस्य विषयो यावत् तावत्सर्वंसमुच्छ्रयम्। पांसुवर्षमिवालक्ष्यं सप्तरात्रं भविष्यति॥' The region thus cursed came to be called Daṇdakâraṇya. 'तस्यासौ दण्डविषयो विन्ध्यशैवलयोर्नृप। शप्तो ब्रह्मर्षिणा तेन वैधर्म्ये सहिते कृते। ततःप्रभृति काकुत्स्थ दण्डकारण्यमुच्यते॥ तपस्विनः स्थिता ह्यत्र जनस्थानमतोऽभवत्।'. The word is explained in the Com.

अटाट्यमानः.

यङ् (य) is added to a root beginning with a consonant and having one vowel to form its Freq. base. "धातोरेकाचो हलादेः क्रियासमभिहारे यङ्" ३।१।२२॥. The Freq. is not thus formed from a root beginning with a vowel like ईक्ष् or from a root having more than one vowel likeजागृ. To this Sûtra there is a Vârtika "सूचिसूत्रि—" which shews that यङ्is to be added to सूच्, सूत्र, मूत्र (roots of the 10th conj. are to be considered अनेकाच्), अट्, ऋ, अश्, and ऊर्णु. *e.g.* सोसूच्यते। सोसूच्यते।मोमूत्र्यते। (In the Freq. the vowel of the reduplicative syllable takes Guṇa.



"गुणोयङ्लुकोः" ७।४।८२), अटाट्यते (the vowel अ of the reduplicative syllable is lengthened in the Freq. "दीर्घोऽकितः" ७।४।८३॥), अरार्थते (ऋ and roots ending in ऋ preceded by a conjunct consonant take their Guṇa in the Freq. "यङि च" ७।४।३०॥) अशाश्यते। ऊर्णोनूयते।.

रघुव्याघ्रौ.

The question is— how is रघु to be taken in the sense of राघव? The अपत्यार्थ अण् affixed to it can not be dropped, as it is dropped in the case of अङ्गाः, वङ्गाः, मगधाः by "तद्राजस्य बहुषु तेनैवास्त्रियाम्" २।४।६२॥; because in the case of रघु the अपत्यार्थ termination is not तद्राज. अञ् and other terminations that are affixed to the names of countries that are also the names of Kshatriyas are designated तद्राज. "ते तद्राजाः" ४।१।१७४॥. रघु is not the name of a country. रघु therefore must be taken in the लक्ष्यor secondary sense of 'descendant of Raghu' Bha. Dî. solves the difficulty in the same way. "रघूणामन्वयं वक्ष्ये" "निरुष्यमाना यदुभिः कथञ्जित्" इति तु रघुयदुशब्दयोस्तदपत्ये लक्षणया'। सिद्धा० कौ०. On the Sûtra "बह्वच इञः प्राच्यभरतेषु" २।४।६६॥ the samequestion is solved in the same way in Haradatta's Padamaṅjarî.

 In the Sarasvatikaṇṭhâbharaṇa, the second half of this verse is different. There the verse reads as under:—

'अंहिषातां रघुव्याघ्रौ शरभङ्गाश्रमं ततः।  
स्वामहौषीत्तनुं वह्नौ दृष्ट्वा तौ रामलक्ष्मणौ॥'

 It is instanced there as containing a वाक्यदोष, called व्यर्थ, which is thus defined:— 'व्यर्थमाहुर्गतार्थं यद् यच्चस्यान्निष्प्रयोजकम्' The notes on it run as follows:—'अत्रांहिषातां दृष्ट्वेत्येताभ्यामेव ताविति रघुव्याघ्रावित्यनेनैव रामलक्ष्मणाविति तनुमित्यनेनैव स्वामिति अहौषीदित्यनेनैव वह्नाविति गम्यते इति गतार्थत्वम्। न च शरभङ्गाश्रमगमनं तनुहोमो वा अग्रतः कथाशरीरोपयोगीति निष्प्रयोजकत्वम्। अतोऽयं व्यर्थनामा वाक्यस्य महावाक्यस्य च दोषो भवति॥.

 The reading of the text has no such fault.

To पथिन्, अतिथि, वसति, and स्वपति, ढञ् (एय) is added in the sense of 'तत्र साधुः' पथि साधु पाथेयम्। आतिथेयम्। वासतेयम्।. Also वसतौ साधुः वासतेयी रात्रिः। स्वापतेयम् (धनम्).

 

शय्योत्थायम्.

This is णमुल् affixed to उद्+स्था according to the Sûtra



"अपादाने परीप्सायाम्" ३।४।५२॥ णमुल् is affixed to a root in the sense of'hurry', when the उपपद is in the ablative case. शय्योत्थायम् means'शय्याया उत्थाय। एवं नाम त्वरते यदवश्यं कर्त्तव्यमपि नापेक्षते। शय्योत्थानमात्रमाद्रियते।' काशि०. Jaya, says:—'त्वरया मुखधावनादीन्यपि न कृत्वा.' Other instances of this sort are' रन्ध्रापकर्षं पयः पिबति। भ्राष्ट्रापकर्षमपूपान्भक्षयति।'

 क्रम् with वि is Atma, in the sense of 'walking.' 'अश्वादीनां गतिविशेषोविक्रमणमुच्यते' says काशि०. Bha. Dî, also says:—‘साधु विक्रमते वाजी'. But here the sense is simply 'walking'. Kâśikâ says:— 'यद्यपि क्रमिः पादविहरणएव पठ्यते क्रमु पादविक्षेप इति तथाप्यनेकार्थत्वाद्धातूनामेवमुक्तम्। पादविहरणे इति किम् विक्रामत्यजिनसंधिः।' विक्रामति means द्विधा भवति। स्फुटति।.

सर्वाङ्गीणे.

ख (ईन) is affixed in the sense of 'pervading it' toसर्वपथ, सर्वाङ्ग, सर्वकर्मन्, सर्वपत्र, and सर्वपात्र. "तत्सर्वादेः पथ्यङ्गकर्मपत्रपात्रं व्याप्नोति" ५।२।७॥ *e.g.* 'सर्वपथं व्याप्नोति सर्वपथीनो रथः। सर्वाङ्गीणस्तापः। सर्वकर्मीणः पुरुषः। सर्वपत्रीणः सारथिः। सर्वपात्रीणः ओदनः।.

 न् is changed to ण् as in मातृभोगीण, पितृभोगीण, and सर्वभोगीण. The Sûtra that is applicable here is "अकुप्वाङ्नुम्व्यवायेऽपि" ८।४।२॥'समानपदे'

is to be supplied here from the preceding Sûtra "रषाभ्यां नो णः समानपदे"८।४।१॥On 'समानपदे' the Manorama says:— 'पद इतीयतैव सामर्थ्यादेकपदत्वेलब्धेऽपि समानग्रहणं यत्समानमेव अखण्डमिति यावत्।' In Sabdaratna we find the following note on अखण्डम्ः—

 'तत्वं च निमित्तानधिकरणनिमित्तिमत्पदाघटितत्वम्। तेन मातृभोगीण इत्यत्र णत्वसिद्धिः। केवलभोगीनेत्यस्य प्रत्ययमात्रस्य वा तत्त्वाभावात्। अत एव "आत्मन्विश्वजन–" इति सूत्रस्थमाचार्यादणत्वं चेति वार्त्तिकं चरितार्थम्। सुपर्वणेत्यादिसिद्धयेनिमित्तानाधिकरणेति। पदं चात्र लोके विभक्तीतरानपेक्षतयार्थबोधकत्वेन दृष्टम्। तेन

 Thus समान is explained as अखण्ड and by अखण्ड we have to understand that the निमित्तिमत्, that is न्, should not be in a *pada* in which निमित्त, that is ॠ, र्, or,ष् is not found. In सर्वाङ्गीण, न् can not be said to be in the *pada* अङ्गीन, for अङ्गीन is not a *pada*, सर्वाङ्गis a *pada* orसर्वाङ्गीन is a *pada*, but अङ्गीन alone or the affix ईन is no*pada*; for it should be remembered that ख (ईन) is added to सर्वादि, that is, here to सर्वाङ्गand not अङ्ग by the Sûtra "तत्सर्वादेःपथ्यङ्गकर्मपत्रपात्रं व्याप्नोति" ५।२।७॥.Thusसर्वाङ्गीण being one *pada* we have र् and न् in the same *pada*. The readingसर्वाङ्गीने is therefore ungrammatical. Though Jaya. has adopted सर्वाङ्गीने, still he himself has सर्वभोगीणमुत्तमम्' C. VI. St 98, where he says:—"अट्कुप्वाङित्यादिना णत्वम्.”

 The remarks of Vrittikâra, Bhâshyakâra, and Kaiyaṭa on the Sûtra "पूर्वपदात्संज्ञायामगः" ८।४।३॥ favour this view.

आशितङ्गवीनानि.

The Sûtra which explains the formation of it is"अषडक्षाशितङ्ग्वलंकर्मालंपुरुषाध्युत्तरपदात्खः" ५।४।७॥ The terminationख (ईन) is added to अषडक्ष, आशितङ्गु, अलंकर्म, अलंपुरुष, and a word having अधि as its second member. This termination has no special meaning. It is merely स्वार्थवाचक. अविद्यमानानि षडक्षीण्यस्येत्यषडक्षःअषडक्ष एव अषडक्षीणो मन्त्रः (यो द्वाभ्यामेव क्रियते न बहुभिः) आशिताः meansआशितवत्यः. It is to be taken actively, as पीत in the sense of पीतवात् inपीतप्रतिबद्धवत्सा, and पीता गावः, and भुक्त in the sense of भुक्तवत् inभुक्ताः ब्राह्मणाः Bha. Dî, says:— 'अश्नातेराङ्पूर्वात् "आशितः कर्त्ता" इति ज्ञापकात् कर्त्तरि क्तः ण्यन्तात् कर्मणि वा उभयथापि प्रभूतयवसमिति फलितोऽर्थः'। मनो०.आशितः is used like विदितः in 'स वर्णिलिङ्गी विदितः समाययौ ' किरा० १. १ .

This Com. gives all possible explanations. आशिता गावः अस्मिन्नित्याशितङ्गवीनमरण्यम्. The augment म्is to be added to the first member of the compound, as the word is used with the augment in the Sûtra (निपातनात्पूर्वपदस्य मुमागमः). अलं कर्मणे अलंकर्मीणः, अलं पुरुषाय अलंपुरुषीणः, राजाधीनः. आशितङ्गवीनानि means 'in which cows have fully satisfied their hunger.'

 

आशितम्भवम्.

To the root भू, with आशित as its *upapada* changed to आशितम्, खच् is affixed in the sense of the instrumentality(करण) of the action of the root or the state (भाव) of it. 'आशितःभवत्यनेन आशितम्भवः ओदनः'. This is करणार्थे खच्. 'आशितस्य भवनं

आशितम्भवम्'. This is भावार्थे खच्. In the text the affix denotes भाव. The word means तृप्तिः.

 The 10th and 11th verses are to be construed together. They form what is called युग्म or युगल.

'द्वाभ्यां तु युग्मकं सन्दानितकं त्रिभिरिष्यते।  
कलापकं चतुर्भिश्च पञ्चभिः कुलकं मतम्॥'

 Others designate them differently:—

आतिष्ठद्गु

and

आयतीगवम्

are irregular Avyayîbhâva compounds. They are classed under a group beginning with तिष्ठद्गु. "तिष्ठद्गुप्रभृतीनि च"२।१।१७॥ तिष्ठद्गु, वहद्गु, आयतीगवम्, खलेयवम्, खलेबुसम् &c. are कालवाचक.प्राह्णम्, प्रदक्षिणम्, सुषमम्, विषमम्, संप्रति, and असंप्रति are in the group. The च in the Sûtra means that no other compound can be formed with them. 'किमर्थश्चकारः। एवकारार्थः। तिष्ठद्गुप्रभृतीन्येव। क्व मा भूत्। परमतिष्ठद्गु'।भाष्य. On this Kaiyṭa says:—

Jaya. says:— 'तिष्ठद्गुप्रभृतीनिचेति चकारस्यानुक्तसमुच्चयार्थत्वादव्ययीभाव एव पुनः समासान्तरं न भवति।'. There is another way of explaining it also.

वलिभम्.

वलि comes under पामादि also, and so it has also न (& possessive affix like भ) affixed to it by “लोमादिपामादिपिच्छादिभ्यः शनेलचः" ५।२।१००॥. We have thus वलिभ and वलिन, both meaning 'having folds.' We have वलिभया उदरश्रिया' in माघ ६।१३.

 

कर्णजाह.

कुणब (कुण) and जाहच् (जाह) are added to the groups beginning with पीलु and कर्ण respectively in the sense of तस्य पाकः andतस्य मूलम् respectively. पीलूनां पाकः पीलुकुणः. कर्णस्य मूलं कर्णजाहम्. कर्णजाहis found in the Mâla Act V.

सुपाद्.

The Fem. is either सुपाद् or सुपदी like द्विपाद् or द्विपदी.

 In the Dvandva

पाणितलाङ्गुली

, अङ्गुलि ought to precede पाणितल, as it has a fewer vowels ("अल्पाच्तरम्" २।२।३४॥). But this पूर्वनिपातशास्त्र is अनित्य, that is, the rules regarding the order of words in the Dvandva compound are not invariably observed. What is the authority for it? The fact that the Sûtrakâra himself does not observe them invariably. In the Sûtra "समुद्राभ्राद्धः" ४।४।११८॥ समुद्र is used before अभ्र. In "लक्षणहेत्वोः क्रियायाः "३।२।१२६॥ हेतु follows लक्षण. In his Ghantâpatha on 'सौष्ठवौदार्यविशेषशालिनीम्' (किरा० १.३) Malli says:— 'अत्रौदार्यशब्दस्याजाद्यदन्तत्वेऽपि "लक्षणहेत्वोः क्रियायाः” इत्यत्राल्पस्वरस्यापि हेतुशब्दस्य पूर्वनिपातमकुर्वता सूत्रकृतैव पूर्वनिपातशास्त्रस्यानित्यत्वज्ञापनान्न पूर्वनिपातः। उक्तं च काशिकायाम्"अयमेव लक्षणहेत्वोरिति निर्देशः पूर्वनिपातव्यभिचारचिह्नम्" इति।'.

चञ्चूर्यमाणा

. The Freq. is formed from लुप्, सद्, चर्, जप्, जभ्, दह्, दश्. and गृृ in the sense of भावगर्हा, that is, censurableness of the actions denoted by the roots चर् and फल् have नुक् (Anusvâra) added after the reduplicative syllable. The अ of these roots is changed to उ. The penultimate इ and उ of roots ending in र् and व् is lengthened when followed by a consonant. नुक् or Anusvâra is to be considered as if it were at the end of a *Pada*. 'नुगित्यनेनानुस्वारो लक्ष्यते। स च पदान्तवद्वाच्यः।.' Thus the forms from चर् and फल् are चञ्चूर्यते, and चंचूर्यते, पम्फुल्यते and पम्फुल्यते andपंफुल्यते.

भीषण.

According to Malli. it is formed by affixing त्यु(अन) to the causal base of भी, it being नन्द्यादि. The word विभीषण is found in the group of नन्द्यादि. If it were to be formed by affixing ल्युट् as Jaya. takes it, the feminine form would be भीषणी by the Sûtra "टिड्ढाणञ्—"४।१।१५॥, it being टित्. In Mâgha where the Fem. भीषणा occurs 'बिभ्युर्बिडालेक्षणभीषणाभ्यः' C. III St. 45, Malli, derives it in the same way—'नन्द्यादित्वात् कर्त्तरि ल्युप्रत्यये टाप्.'

दारगवाणाम्.

By the Sûtra "कुमति च" ८।४।१३॥न् must be necessarily changed to ण् in दारगवाणाम्. The Sûtra teaches that if the उत्तर-



पद (latter member) of a compound has a letter of the gutteral class, then the न्coming at the end of the प्रातिपदिक (crude form of the word) or in नुम् (nom., ac., and voc. plu. ter. नि) or in any case termination is changed to ण् necessarily, provided the पूर्वपद(first member) of the compound has ॠ, र्, or ष् *e.g.* वस्त्रयुगिणौ। वस्त्रयुगिणः। स्वर्गकामिणौ। वृषगामिणौ।. In all these we have न् at the end of a प्रातिपदिक. In वस्त्रयुगाणि। खरयुगाणि। we have न् in नुम्. In वस्त्रयुगेण। खरयुगेण। there is न् in विभक्ति. The Sûtra "एकाजुत्तरपदे णः" ८।४।१२॥ that precedes "कुमति च" shews that the rules are now no longer optional. 'ण इति वर्त्तमाने पुनर्णग्रहणं विकल्पाधिकारनिवृत्तेर्विस्पष्टीकरणार्थम्।' काशि०. Thus the Sûtra "कुमति च" is नित्यणत्वविधायक. It is difficult therefore to explain दारगवानाम् adopted by Jaya, and some of the Mss. But we have instances of the departure of the Sûtra "कुमति च" in 'व्यतिरेकमुखेन', used by commentators on poeties, and 'कर्मयोगेन योगिनाम्' (Gitâ.) These can only be explained, we believe, by putting them under क्षुभ्नादि which is an आकृतिगण. 'अविहितलक्षणो णत्वप्रतिषेधः क्षुम्नादिषु द्रष्टव्यः।' काशि०. Commenting on the following passage from Manoramâ'न वा चित्रगुशब्दाच्चित्रगवीणां समीपवर्ती वृक्षादिः प्रतीयते' Śabdaratnakâra says:—

To this टाप् (आ) is added to form the Fem. "अजाद्यतष्टाप्४।१।४॥. We have thus लोलूया. In the case of रोरुद्य, य is dropped before the termination अ. "अतो लोपः" ६।४।४८॥ teaches that the Ârdhadhâtuka



(non-conjugational) अ is dropped before an Ârdhadhâtuka affix. Theअ of the Freq. य as well as the affix अ is आर्धधातुक. The अ of रोरुद्यbeing thus dropped, we have रोरुद्य् + अ. Further the य् of रोरुद्य् is dropped by "यस्य हलः" ६।४।४९॥ which means that the य् preceded by a consonant is dropped when followed by an आर्धधातुक termination.

राक्षससभम्.

सभा at the end of a Tatpurusha compound becomes neuter, that is, is changed to सभम्,when preceded by a word having the sense of king or by a word meaning an evil spirit: *e.g.* ' इनसभम्। ईश्वरसभम्। इह कस्मान्न भवति। राजसभा।पर्यायवचनस्यैवेष्यते। तदुक्तम्। जितपर्यायस्यैव राजाद्यर्थमिति। अमनुष्यपूर्वा। रक्षःसभम्। पिशाचसभम्। इह कस्मान्न भवति। काष्ठसभा। अमनुष्यशब्दो रूढिरूपेण रक्षःपिशाचादिष्वेव वर्त्तते। राजामनुष्यपूर्वेति किम्। देवदत्तसभा।' काशि०.

 विनसा.

When नासिका is preceded by वि, it is changed to ग्र or ख्य. "वेर्ग्रोवक्तव्यः" विगता नासिकाऽस्य विग्रः। "ख्यश्च"॥ विख्यः। 'कथं तर्हि विनसा हतबान्धवेति भट्टिः। विगतया नासिकयोपलक्षितेति व्याख्येयम्।' सिद्धा० कौ०. Thus Bha. Dî's explanation is that विनसा is Inst. Sing. of विनासिका which is to be taken as a कर्मधारय compound. विगता चासौ नासिका च विनासिका तया विनासिकया विनसा वा. "वेर्ग्रोवक्तव्यः" is a Vârtika on "उपसर्गाच्च”५।४।११९॥ which is applicable to नासिका at the end of a बहुव्रीहि compound. When the compound therefore is taken to be कर्मधारय, नासिका remains unchanged. But नासिका is changed to नस् optionally before terminations beginning with Acc. Plu. “पद्दन्नोमास्हृन्निशसन्यूषन्दोषन्यकञ्छकन्नुदन्नासञ्छस्प्रभृतिषु" ६।१।६३॥The Inst. Sing. is thus विनासिकया or विनसा. Further the Inst. is taken in the sense of उपलक्षण. "इत्थंभूतलक्षणे "२।३।२१॥. Hence विनसा is equal to विगतया नासिकयोपलक्षिता.

पात्रेसमितैः

= ready at meals. but not on occasions of need. The compound implies censure. 'पात्रेसमिताः भोजनसमये एव संगताः न तु कार्ये' सिद्धा० कौ०. The च in the Sûtra "पात्रेसमितादयश्च" २।१।४८॥shows that the words coming under the group can not form a part of any other compound. 'चकारोऽवधारणार्थः। तेनैषां समासान्तरे घटकतया प्रवेशो न। परमाः पात्रेसमिताः।' सिद्धा० कौ०. The Kâśikâ reads "पात्रेसंमितादयश्च". Malli's reading is also पात्रेसंमितैः. The reading found in the Bhâshya is पात्रेसमित. According to the Kâśikâ the censure is thus implied:— 'अवधारणेन क्षेपो गम्यते। पात्रे एव संमिता न पुनः क्वचित्कार्ये।' पात्रेबहुलाः, कूपमण्डूकः, कूपकच्छपः, उदुम्बरमशकः, नगरकाकः, मातरिपुरुषः, पिण्डीशूरः, पितरिशूरः, गेहेनर्दी, गेहेशूरः are among the group. The group is an आकृतिगण.

 

खट्वारूढः

= lying on a bed when forbidden to do so, hence going astray. The compound implies censure. It is a नित्यसमास; because the sense of the compound can not be implied by a sentence. 'क्षेपो निन्दा स च समासार्थ एव तेन विभाषाधिकारेऽपि नित्यसमास एवायं न हि वाक्येन क्षेपो गम्यते। खट्वारोहणं चेह विमार्गप्रस्थानस्योपलक्षणम्। सर्व एवाविनीतः खट्वारूढ इत्युच्यते। खट्वारूढो जाल्मः। खट्वाप्लुतः। अपथप्रस्थित इत्यर्थः।' काशि०. The Bhâshya on this Sûtra gives the sense clearly:—

 'क्षेप इत्युच्यते। कः क्षेपो नाम। अधीत्य स्नात्वा गुरुभिरनुज्ञातेन खट्वारोढव्या। य इदानीमतोऽन्यथा करोति स उच्यते खट्वारूढोऽयं जाल्मो नातिव्रतवान्।'.

 On this Kaiyata says:—

 

अधीत्येति।

ब्रह्मचारिणा वेदाध्ययने निष्पादिते गृहस्थाश्रमः कर्त्तव्यः।

अन्यथेति।

असमाप्तेऽध्ययने भूमिशयनार्हो यः खट्वारोहणं करोतीत्यर्थः। खट्वारोहणं चाविनयोपलक्षणार्थमित्याह।

'नातिव्रतवानिति।'

 

अत्यन्तीनत्वम्.

ख (ईन) is added to अत्यन्त in the sense of गामी. "अवारपारात्यन्तानुकामं गामी" ५।२।११॥. अवारपारं गामी अवारपारीणः "विपरीताच्च".We have thus पारावारीणः "विगृहीतादपीष्यते"। We thus get अवारीणः and पारीणः. अत्यन्तं गामी अत्यन्तीनः भृशं गन्तेत्यर्थः। अनुकामं गामी अनुकामीनः। यथेष्टं गन्तेत्यर्थः। In the text it must be taken as Malli, takes 'Invariably coming, that is, coming only to yourself.' अत्यन्त must be taken in the sense of निश्चित as in 'कस्यात्यन्तं सुखमुपनतं दुःखमेकान्ततो वा' मेघ०.

 In the reading

'नात्यन्तीनां त्वमुन्मनाः'

found in D. 'अत्यन्तीना means very fickle,' अध्यन्तगमनशीला 'which is fickle by its very nature. '



 Looking to the general sense of अत्यन्तीन, the reading of D. is preferable.

आहोपुरुषिकाम्.

अहोपुरुष is not found in the group of मनोज्ञादि which, besides, is not on आकृतिगण. Malli's derivation is therefore better than that of Jaya. and other commentators, to whom he refers by 'केचित्.' मयूरव्यंसकादि is an आकृतिगण, and आहोपुरुषिका is found in it in the Gaṇapâṭha. ‘आकृतिगणोऽयम्। तेन। अकुतोभयः, कान्दिशीकः (कान्देशीकः), आहोपुरुषिका, अहमहमिका, यदृच्छा, एहिरेयाहिरा, उन्मृजावमृजा, द्रव्यान्तरम्, अवश्यकार्यम् इत्यादि सिद्धम्'।.

 The figure of speech noticed by Malli. in this verse is उदात्त, which consists either of the description of extraordinary prosperity or in the



greatness of some one collaterally brought about. 'उदात्तं वस्तुनः संपन्महतां चोपलक्षणम्' काव्य०. The following is an instance of the second kind of उदात्तः—

‘तदिदमरण्यं यस्मिन्दशरथवचनानुपालनव्यसनी।  
निवसन्बाहुसहायश्चकार रक्षःक्षयं रामः॥'

 Here दण्डका is वर्णनीया ( subject in hand ) and राम is subordinate to the subject in hand (उपलक्षणम्). The greatness of अरण्य is increased by the greatness of Rama. 'महतः श्रीरामस्यारण्योत्कर्षकतया तदङ्गभावः' We might say that there is अतिशयोक्त्यलंकार also in the verse. पूर्णचन्द्रस्य सर्वदा संनिध्यसंबन्धेऽपि तद्वर्णनादसंबन्धे संबन्धातिशयोक्तिः.

हस्तरोधम्.

Malli, is in favour of taking this as a Bahuvrîhi compound qualifying धनुः and rightly. It can not be taken as णमुलन्त as Jaya. takes it, because the Sûtra "सप्तम्यां चोपपीडरुधकर्षः" ३।४।४९॥requires the root उपरुध् and not रुध् alone. 'उपशब्दःप्रत्येकमभिसंबध्यते' काशि०. 'सूत्रे पीडादीनां समाहारद्वन्द्वं कृत्वा उपपूर्वः पीडादिरिति उत्तरपदलोपः समासः इति भावः पुंस्त्वं तु सौत्रं पञ्चम्यर्थे प्रथमा।' मनो०. Hence the Sûtra means 'उपपूर्वेभ्यः पीडरुधकर्षेभ्यः सप्तम्यन्त उपपदे चकारात् तृतीयान्त उपपदे णमुल्प्रत्ययो भवति' काशि०. Hence the णमुलन्त form should be हस्तोपरोधम् and not हस्तरोधम्.

कार्त्तवीर्य

is सहस्रार्जुन. When he was once enjoying जलक्रीडाwith his wives in the Narmadâ, his thousand hands changed the current of water so that it carried away Râvaṇa's materials of the worship of S'iva. Râvaṇa was therefore enraged and went to fight with Arjuna. Arjuna



captured Rávaṇa and tied him by his bow-string. 'स तु बाहुसहस्रेण बलाद्गृह्य दशाननम्। बबन्ध बलवान् राजा बलिं नारायणो यथा॥..... राक्षसांस्त्रासयामास कार्त्तवीर्यार्जुनस्तदा। रावणं गृह्य नगरं प्रविवेश सुहृद्वृतः॥' रामा० उत्त० ३२ स०. On hearing this पुलस्त्य, the grandfather of Râvaṇa, went to Kârtavîrya, and requested him to release Râvaṇa. 'भयाद्यस्योपतिष्ठेतां निष्पन्दौसागरानिलो। सोऽयं मृधे त्वया बद्धः पौत्रो मे रणदुर्जयः॥ पुत्रकस्य यशः पीतं नाम विश्रावितं त्वया। मद्वाक्याद्याच्यमानोऽद्य मुञ्च वत्स दशाननम्॥ पुलस्त्याज्ञां प्रगृह्याथ न किञ्चन वचोऽर्जुनः। मुमोचैव पार्थिवेन्द्रो राक्षसेन्द्रं प्रहृष्टवत्॥' रामा० उत्त० ३३ स०. Then a friendship was formed between them. The friendship thus brought about is

हीनसंधि

ignoble to Râvaṇa. The मैत्री is mentioned in रामायण. 'ततः स राजा पिशिताशनानां सहस्रबाहोरुपलभ्य मैत्रीम्। पुनर्नृपाणां कदनं चकार चचार सर्वां पृथिवीं च दर्पात्॥' This incident is mentioned in the Raghu. 'ज्याबन्धनिष्पन्दभुजेन यस्य विनिःश्वसद्वक्रपरंपरेण। कारागृहे निर्जितवासवेन लङ्केश्वरेणोषितमाप्रसादात्॥६।४०॥ Hemâdri thus comments upon the incident. 'पूर्वं हि जलकेलिलोलविलासिनीस्नानार्थार्जुनभुजपरिवरुद्धरेवावारिप्रवाहापहृतशिवलिङ्गार्चारुषितं रणरसागतं रावणं मृधे जित्वा कार्त्तवीर्योऽर्जुनो निजचापज्याबन्धेन बबन्धे इत्यागमः।' This Kârtavîrya was slain by Paraśurâma for having violently carried away the Kâmadhenu of his father, Jamadagni. This is thus described in the Mahâbhârata:—

are all Bahuvrîhi compounds in which the past participles, which being adjectives should stand as first members of compounds, are used as second members. They all come under आहिताग्नि, because it is an आकृतिगण. The Sūtra "वाहिताग्न्यादिषु" २।२।३७॥teaches that past participles may stand either as first members or as second members. We have thus आहिताग्निः or अग्न्याहितः, similarly सुखजातः or जातसुखः, सुरापीतः, or पीतसुरः, and नजग्धः or जग्धनृकः ("नद्यृतश्च" ५।४।१५३॥ कप् being affixed as समासान्त, to a Bahuvrîhi compound ending in a Fem. ईकारान्त or ऊकारान्त noun or in ऋकारान्त noun).

अभाययत्.

भी has three causal forms, भाययति, भापयते, and भीषयते. The two latter forms are used when भयproceeds from the हेतु (causal agent). 'मुण्डो भीषयते। जटिलो भीषयते।'. When the source of fear is other than the causal agent, भाययति is used, as in 'कुञ्चिकयैनं भाययति। अत्र कुञ्चिका भयस्य करणं न हेतुः'. हेतु means प्रयोजक. 'हेतुरिह पारिभाषिकः स्वतन्त्रस्थ (*i.e.* कर्त्तुः) प्रयोजकः' अभाययत्, the reading of E1, is open to objection. The Sûtra "भीस्म्योर्हेतुभये" १।३।६८॥ teaches that भी and स्मी take Atma, terminations in the causal when the fear proceeds from the causal agent, andभीandस्मीare changed to भा and स्मा in the causal (भी optionally and स्मीnecessarily) and hence form भापय or भीषय andस्मापय as their causal bases when the source of fear is the causal agent ("बिभेतेर्हेतुभये" ६।१।५६॥ and "नित्यं स्मयतेः" ६।१।५७॥). We have thus भीष-



यते or भापयते and स्मापयते in the sense of हेतुभय, On the Pars, form विस्मापयन् in 'विस्मापयन्विस्मितमात्मवृत्तौ' रघु० २.३३. Malli says:—‘विस्मापयन् इति पाठे पुगागममात्रं वक्तव्यम्। तच्च“नित्यं स्मयतेः" इति हेतुभयविवक्षायामेवेति "भीस्म्योर्हेतुभये" इत्यात्मनेपदे विस्मापयमान इति स्यात्। तस्मान्मनुष्यवाचा विस्माययन्निति रूपं सिद्धम्। करणविवक्षायां न कश्चिद्दोषः।.'

यथामुखीनः.

यथा forms the first member of an अव्ययीभावcompound in the sense of असादृश्य ("यथाऽसादृश्ये" २।१।७॥). In यथा हरिस्तथा हरः, यथा has the sense of सादृश्य and therefore a compound cannot be formed of यथा and हरि. In the compound 'यथामुखम्'however, यथा has the sense of सादृश्य; it being an exception, being so used by Pâṇini. 'मुखस्य सदृशं यथामुखं प्रतिबिम्बम्। निपातनात्सादृश्येऽव्ययीभावः’। To the word यथामुख, thus formed, स्व (ईन) is affixed in the sense of दर्शन,*i e.*, a mirror or a reflector. 'दृश्यतेऽस्मिन्निति दर्शनः आदर्शादिः प्रतिविम्बाश्रय उच्यते’ काशि०. Thus यथामुखीन means यथामुखं दर्शनः or यथामुखं दर्शनमस्मिन् *i.e.,* प्रतिबिम्वाश्रय इव, 'standing before (Sîtâ) so that her body may be reflected in his,' in other words 'standing just against Sîtâ.'

मृगलोचना.

मृगलोचने इव लोचने यस्याः सा, Bahuvrîhi compound formed according to the Vârtika 'सप्तम्युपमानपूर्वपदस्योत्तरपदलोपश्च वक्तव्यः' on the Sûtra "अनेकमन्यपदार्थे "२।२।२४॥.The Vârtika is thus explained in the Bhâshya:—‘सप्तमीपूर्वस्योपमानपूर्वस्य च बहुव्रीहिर्वक्तव्यः उत्तरपदस्य च लोपो वक्तव्यः। कण्ठेस्थःकालोऽस्य कण्ठेकालः। उष्ट्रमुखमिवमुखमस्योष्ट्रमुखः। खरमुखः।'. Kaiyaṭa says:—‘समासे सिद्धे वचनमुत्तरपदलोपार्थम्।

उष्ट्रमुखमिवेति।

अवयवधर्मेण समुदायस्य व्यपदेशाद् उष्ट्रस्योपमानतेति उपमानपूर्व उष्ट्रमुखशब्दः उपमानोपमेयवृत्तित्वात्पदयोर्वैयधिकरण्यमत्रेति वचनमुत्तरपदलोपार्थं च।'. The Vârtika means that when the पूर्वपद्of a Bahuvrîhi consists of two parts of which the first is in the locative case or an उपमान, the second member of the पूर्वपद is dropped. In कण्ठेकालः, स्थ, the उत्तरपद of the पूर्वपद कण्ठेस्थः, is dropped and so in उष्ट्रमुखः or मृगलोचना, मुख and लोचन, the उत्तरपद of the पूर्वपद‍ उष्ट्रमुखम् and मृगलोचने, are dropped. The compound has already been sanctioned; but the Vârtika sanctions, as Kaiyaṭa remarks, the dropping of the उत्तरपद. The question as to how उष्ट्र, the first part of the पूर्वपद, उष्ट्रमुखम् is to be considered an उपमान, the real उपमान being the whole word, is settled by Kaiyaṭa by extending to the whole the property which belongs to the part. मुख being the उपमान, the whole उष्ट्र may be looked upon as उपमान. When the compound is thus solved, it is an example of त्रिलुप्तोपमा, the उपमान, the उपमाद्योतक, and the साधारणधर्म being dropped.

परिदेविनी

विवञ्चिषोः=

Desiring to cheat or entice away. The form is made up of वञ्च्1st Conj. which generally means 'to go’, but is here used in the sense of 'enticing away'. (धातूनामनेकार्थत्वात्). But this view is not very satisfactory. Another explanation given by commentators, is that it is derived from वञ्च् 10th Conj, but अय् of the 10th Conj., is not affixed to the root, as according to one theory अय् may not be added to a root of the 10th Conj. 'तेषामनित्यणिच्कत्वात्'. Jaya says:—'येषामनित्यण्यन्ताश्चुरादय इति दर्शनं तेषां मतेनात्रापि सिध्यति।'. Bha, Dî, says;—''चुरादिभ्य एव बहुलं णिजित्यर्थ इत्यन्ये।'.

सुखाभव.

Malli's reading is

सुखाकुरु.

The Sûtra which explains the formation is "सुखप्रियादानुलोम्ये" ५।४।६३॥. To the words सुख and प्रिय, डाच् (आ) is affixed in the sense of आनुलोम्य and the forms of कृare added on, आनुलोम्य is explained as अनुकूलता, आराध्यचित्तानुवर्त्तनम् सुखाकरोति and प्रियाकरोति are equal to स्वाम्यादेश्चित्तमाराधयति. Generally the forms of कृ alone are joined to सुखand प्रिय in this sense. In the Sûtra "कृञो द्वितीयतृतीयशम्बबीजात्कृषौ" ५।४।५८॥ कृञ् is mentioned to prevent the अनुवृत्ति of भू and अस्. 'पुनः कृञ्ग्रहणं स्वस्त्योर्निवृत्यर्थम्' काशि०. In the subsequent Sûtra कृalone is taken and not भू and अस्. On the Sûtras 59, 60, 61, 62, 64, 65, 66, and 67 the Kâśikâ



clearly says 'कृञ इत्येव.' Though कृञ इत्येव is not found in the explanation of the Sûtra 63, still 'कृञो योगे' occurs there. The explanation is 'सुखप्रियशब्दाभ्यामानुलोम्ये वर्त्तमानाभ्यां कृञो योगे डाच् प्रत्ययो भवति।'. Bha. Dî. also gives 'सुखाकरोति प्रियाकरोति गुरुम्। अनुकूलाचरणेनानन्दयतीत्यर्थः' as instances to illustrate the Sûtra. He too does not join भूand अस् to these words. 'सुखाकुरु' is therefore a better reading than सुखाभव Jaya explains the form सुखाभव by connecting भू and अस् with the Sûtra. 'सुखप्रियादानुलोम्ये इति कृभ्वस्तियोगे डाच्.' For this, however, as it must have been seen, there does not seem to be much anthority, unless we have the अनुवृत्ति of भू and अस् in the Sûtra by मण्डूकप्लुति.

means 'religious acts'. पूर्त्त means 'acts of piety and liberality'. Manu says:—'वापीकूपतडागादि देवतायतनानि च। अन्नप्रदानमारामः पूर्त्तमित्यभिधीयते॥'. Another Smṛiti defines it thus:— 'पुष्करिण्यः सभा वापी देवतायतनानि च। आरामश्च विशेषेण पूर्त्तं कर्म विनिर्दिशेत्॥'.

आदौ मुषितः पश्चान्नग्नोनग्नमुषितः तेन प्रख्यस्तत्प्रख्यस्तम्. नग्नमुषित is a कर्मधारय compound like स्नातानुलिप्त.मुषितwhich ought to be used first is placed after नग्न; because the compound comes under राजदन्तादि. "राजदन्तादिषु परम्” २।२।३१॥ teaches that there is a number of compounds beginning with राजदन्त,in which what deserves to be the first member is used as second member. दन्तानां राजा राजदन्तः. अग्रेवणम्, नग्नमुषितम्, शूद्रार्यम्, भार्यापती, जंपती, दंपती, जायापती, अक्षिभ्रुवम्, and दारगवम्, are among the group. The group is an आकृतिगण. There is a Vârtika to it 'धर्मादिष्वनियमः' which shews that there is no rule as regards order in the group धर्मादि. धर्मार्थौ, अर्थधर्मौ; शब्दार्थौ, अर्थशब्दौ; कामार्थौ, अर्थकामौ; आद्यन्तौ, अन्तादी; and गुणवृद्धी, वृद्धिगुणौ come under धर्मादि.

समुद्रोपत्यका.

उपत्यका is ground at the foot of the mountain, and अधित्यका is ground at the top of the mountain उपत्यका must therefore be taken to mean simply आ

He says:— " 'संमुद्रोपत्यका हैमी ' इति प्रयोगो लक्षणयैव।". The view taken in the Vṛitti is 'संज्ञाधिकाराद्यंनियतविषयमासन्नारूढं (*i.e.* आसन्न and आरूढं in the Sûtra "उपाधिभ्यां त्यकन्नासन्नारूढयोः" ५।२।३४॥) गम्यते। पर्वतस्यासन्नमुपत्यका तस्यैवारूढमधित्यका।' Jaya. takes a similar view.

अश्नीतपिबतीयन्ती.

अश्नीतपिबता is a मयूरव्यंसकादि compound. In the group we find 'आख्यातमाख्यातेन क्रियासातत्ये', that is, one verbal form is compounded with another to shew the continuity of action. अश्नीतपिबता means अश्नीत पिबतेत्येवं सततं यत्राभिधीयते सा. It qualifies a word like क्रीडाin the Fem, and hence the Fem. form, 'अन्यपदार्थस्य क्रीडादिरूपत्वेन स्त्रीत्वात् समासत्वेन प्रातिपदिकतयात्र टाप्।’अश्नीतपिबता thus means a feast in



which people are invited to eat and drink. पचतभृज्जता, खादतमोदता,खादताचमता are compounds of a similar type. From the noun अश्नीतपिचता, a denominative is formed by adding क्यच् to denote wish अश्नीतपिबतामात्मन इच्छतीति अश्नीतपिवतीयति. अश्नीतपिबतीयन्ती is Fem. Pres. Part, of the root. It thus means ‘wishing to be queen ordering people to eat and drink as you choose'; ‘wishing to be queen with supreme authority'.

कामाग्निः.

Jaya, sqlves it as 'कामोऽग्निरिव', that is, as उपमितसमास like पुरुषव्याघ्रः; but it should be taken as a Karmadhâraya compound like मयूरव्यंसकः (मयूरो व्यंसकः मयूरव्यंसकः, व्यंसको धूर्त्तः). When it is taken as उपमितसमास, काम shouldbecomethe predominant (प्रधान) ward in the compound, and when it is taken as मयूरव्यंसकादि, अग्नि becomes predominant Whetherकाम should become the predominant idea or अग्निis to be settled from other words in the sentence with which the compound is connected. The word 'ओषाञ्चकार', which means ‘burnt,' can be connected with the idea of अग्नि better than with that of काम. Hence (*i.e.*दाहलिङ्गात्) the compound comes under मयूरव्यंसकादि and the figure of speech is रूपक, not उपमा. If instead of ओषाञ्चकार we have a word like ववृधे, which equally suits काम and अग्नि both the compound may be solved either way and the figure would be रूपकोपमयोः संदेहसंकरः.

  Of the two objects

सीताम्,

सीताम् is the direct object or प्रधानकर्म and लक्ष्मणम् is the indirect object or अकथितकर्म. This secondary object or गौण कर्म is called अकथित; because it is not desired to be expressed as अपादान or any other कारक relation, 'अकथितमपादानादिविशेषैरविवक्षितम्' 'अपादानत्वादिविवक्षायां पञ्चम्यादिरेव। गोर्दुग्धं दोग्धि व्रजे गां रुणद्धीत्यादि।' But in the case of these roots, याच्, प्रच्छ्, and भिक्ष् the secondary object is necesarily put in the accusative case.

As it changes its ऊ to उव्(सुभ्रुवौ, सुभ्रुवः). it is not नदीसंज्ञक ('नेयङुवङ्स्थानावस्त्री' १।४।४॥), and therefore the Voc.

This is the Aorist 3rd Per Sing. of the कर्मकर्त्तृ form ofचि.A

Sing.) in the कर्मकर्त्तृ construction:—*e g.*अकारि कटः स्वयमेव। अकृत कटः स्वयमेव। अलावि केदारः स्वयमेव। अलविष्टं केदारः स्वयमेव।’. In the passive construction इ necessarily takes the place of स्तः—*e. g.*'अकारि कटो देवदत्तेन।' We have thus उपाचायि and उपाचायिष्ट as Aorist 3rd Per. Sing. of the कर्मकर्तृ form of चि.

मावधिष्ठाः.

Malli. takes it as equal to मा+अवधिष्ठाः. आवधिष्ठाः is the Aorist of हन् with आ. आहन् is Atmanepadi when intransitive.हन् substitutes वध् optionally in Aorist. When माis used with Aorist or Imperfect, the augment अor आ is not used. Hence मा आ वधिष्ठाः. When it is taken as Intransitive as it must be taken to explain or rather justify the Atma.form, a verbal form is to be supplied for माजटायुम्. This is श्रुतार्थापत्ति as in 'प्रविश पिण्डीमित्यादौ गृहं भक्षयेत्यादि’*(vide* Kâvya-Pra, Ul. 2). Hence मां जटायुम् is equal to मां जटायुं विद्धि. In Kirâtârjunîya a transitive form of आहन् is found in the Atmanepada. 'उन्मज्जन्मकर इवामरापगाया वेगेन प्रतिमुखमेत्य बाणनद्याः। गाण्डीवी कनकशिलानिभं भुजाभ्यामाजघ्ने विषमविलोचनस्य वक्षः॥' On this Malli. remarks as follows:—

Jaya's reading is बलापकर्षम्. He explains it thus:— 'बलादाकृष्येव पाकादिकमनपेक्ष्य' बलापकर्षम् is taken by some as a बहुव्रीहि compound, used as a क्रियाविशेषण.

 This is an instance of उत्तरालंकार, where questions are to be gathered from replies. 'Who are you? Whence the state of a demon? How will you be released from it ?'— these questions are to be gathered from replies 'अहं राम' &c. mentioned in the verse. Vidyânâtha thus defines it. 'उत्तरात्प्रश्न उन्नेयो यत्र प्रश्नोत्तरे तथा। बहुधा च निबध्येते तदुत्तरमुदीर्यते॥'. The verse illustrates the first kindof उत्तरmentioned here. The second kind of उत्तरis one in which there are many questions and replies of an extraordinary nature as in the following verse:—

'किं णु धणंकुलबिज्जा को लाहो सज्जणेण सहबासो।

श्रियः पुत्रः.

The son of the demon Śrî. The Râmâyana describes. him as the son of Danu. 'तदा त्वं प्राप्स्यसे रूपं स्वमेव विपुलं शुभम्। श्रिया विराजितं पुत्रं दनोस्त्वं विद्धि लक्ष्मण॥'. This means तदा स्वं विपुलं शुभं श्रिया विराजितं रूपं प्राप्स्यसे। एवंवृत्तं मां दनोः पुत्रं विद्धि। But here there is another reading noticed in the Tilaka by Râma. 'श्रिया विराजितं पुत्रं तनुं त्वं विद्धि लक्ष्मण' इति पाठान्तरम्। It is thus explained there. 'तदा श्रियाः श्रीनाम्नोदानवस्य पुत्रं दनुनामानमित्यर्थः'. This second reading seems better; for further on we have 'एवमुक्तस्तु धर्मात्मा दनुना तेन राघवः' where he is called Danu. The story is thus related. He was the son of Śrî or Danu. He was as beautiful as the Sun. Being able to change his beauty at will, he frightened the Rishis, assuming a terrific form. A sage, named Sthûla-Śiras thereupon cursed him that he would always be in the demonic form. The sage, being propitiated, said that he would get his original form when Râma would cut off his hands and burn him in a tenantless forest. After this curse he practised austerities and having satisfied Brahmâ was blessed by him with long life. He then grew proud and challenged Indra, who cut off his thighs and head and introduced the head into his belly. Indra was thereupon requested by him to put an end to his life; for said he, 'it is better to die than to live in this form.' But Indra said:— 'no, let the blessing of Brahmâ be fulfilled.' Then said he 'अनहारः कथं शक्तोभग्नसक्थिशिरोमुखः।



वाज्रिणाभिहतः कालं सुदीर्घमपि जीवितुम्॥ स एवमुक्तः शक्रो मे बाहू योजनमायतौ।तदा चास्यंच मे कुक्षौ तीक्ष्णदंष्ट्रमकल्पयत्॥'. He was thus known as कबन्धand योजनबाहु.

 Dual forms ending in ई, ऊ, and ए, अमी, words ending in शे (ए)which is substituted for case endings in the Vedas, adverbs of one syllable except आङ्, and adverbs ending in ओ, are called प्रगृह्य.There are four cases in which the vowel is optionally called प्रगृह्य.

धायैरामोदमुत्तमम्.

Jaya. explains it differently. 'धायैरामोदमुत्तममामोदं प्रियासङ्गमेन हर्षंयावत् विरहिभ्यो दत्तस्य दुःखस्य धायैः पोषकैरित्यर्थः। उत्तममिति क्रियाविशेषणमुत्तममामोदं धायैः कुसुमानां परिमलं धारयद्भिरिति व्याख्याने अनित्यत्वात्कृत्प्रयोगे कर्मषष्ठ्यभावः।’ Thus according to Jaya, the अन्वय is'उत्तममामोदं (यावत् इति शेषः, अत्यन्तसंयोगे द्वितीया) मादृग्भ्यो दुःखस्यधायैः'.He takes आमोद in the sense of हर्ष. The reason why he adopts this construction is that धाय beinga कृदन्त, the object of it must take the geni-



tive case according to the Sûtra "कर्त्तृकर्मणोः कृति" २।३।६५॥. On this Sûtra the Kâśikâ says:— 'कृत्प्रयोगे कर्त्तरि च कर्मणि च षष्ठीविभक्तिर्भवति। भवतः शायिका। भवत आसिका। कर्मणि। अपां स्रष्टा। पुरां भेत्ता। वञ्चस्य भर्त्ता। कर्त्तृकर्मणीति किम्। शस्त्रेण भेत्ता। कृतीति किम्। तद्धितप्रयोगे मा भूत्। कृतपूर्वी कटम्। भुक्तपूर्वी ओदनम्। शेष इति निवृत्तं पुनः कर्मग्रहणात्। इतरथा हि कर्त्तरि च कृतीति ब्रूयात्।'. Malli, however, supplies शेषे in the Sûtra, Jaya also considers the use of the genitive with a कृदन्त as अनित्य. Bha. Dî. takes the same view. 'अथ कथं "धायैरामोदमुत्तमम्" इति भट्टिः। अत्राहुः। अनित्यमिदम्। "तदर्हम्" इति निर्देशात्' मनो०. On "तदर्हम्" ५।१।११७॥ we find the following remarks in the Manoramâ:—

 

'तदर्हः

The roots प्रु 'to jump' सृ (or स्रु)and लू take the affix वुन् (The Guṇa-making अक) in the sense of समभिहार. समभिहार means 'repetition', and as repetition gives skill, it is to be taken here in the secondary sense of 'doing a thing well.' 'समभिहारग्रहणेन साधुकारित्वं लक्ष्यते। भूयः सहचरात्। यो हि भूयो यां क्रियां

अल्पम्पचान्.

The Sûtra "मितनखे च" ३।२।३४॥teaches that पच्takes खश् when preceded by मित and नख as objects. मितं पचति मितम्पचा ब्राह्मणी। नखम्पचा यवागूः। This Sûtra is given to shew that the*upapada* may be a word which does not mean measure; for the preceding Sûtra "परिमाणे पचः" ३।२।३३॥sanctions खश् when the *upapada* is aपरिमाणवाचक word, as in प्रस्थंपचा स्थाली। द्रोणपचः। खारिम्पचः कटाहः.। On the Sûtra "मितनखे च" the Kâśikâsays:—'अपरिमाणार्थ आरम्भः।'. The चin the Sûtra evidently connects it with the preceding Sûtra "परिमाणेपचः" (scil खश्), “मितनखे च" (पचः खश्). In many Sûtras च is similarly used *e.g.* “भिक्षासेनादायेषु च "३।२।१७॥ preceding "चरेष्टः" ३।२।१६॥"वयसि च" ३।२।१०॥preceding “हरतेरनुद्यमनेऽच् "३।२।९॥" नाडीमुष्टयोश्च”३।२।३०॥preceding "नासिकास्तनयोर्ध्माधेटोः" ३।२\।२९॥. The words मित andनख are not taken asअर्थपर (implying their synonyms also) either in the Kâśikâ or in Kaumudî. Hence Malli, shews his own अरुचि by saying"मितनखे च" इति मितशब्दस्यार्थपरत्वादनुक्तसमुच्चयाच्चकाराद्वाअल्पशब्दोपपदात्पचेःखशित्याहुः’. He refers to Jaya. and other Commentators. Jaya. says'अल्पं पचन्तीति मितनखे चेति मितेत्यर्थग्रहणात् खश्। चकारस्यानुक्तसमुच्चयार्थत्वाद्वा।' This is simply a way to justify the form as it is used by Bhaṭṭi,‘स्थितेषु प्रयोगेषु समर्थनमेतत्' as Mammaṭa puts it.

**सर्वङ्कषयशः शाखम्**

व्यतैव' Malati. Ac. I. सर्वङ्कषा means 'all-destroying,' 'all-powerful'. Jaya. explains it as सर्वहरा. The word is formed by the Sûtra "सर्वकूलाभ्रकरीषेषु कषः "३।२।४२॥. कष् takes the affix खच् (अ) when preceded by सर्व, कूल, अभ्र, and करीषas its objects.'सर्वङ्कषः खलः। कूलङ्कषा नदी। अभ्रङ्कषो गिरिः। करीषङ्कषा वात्या।' काशि०.

Here it must be solved in the first way; because we have ऋतुमिव रामम् and not ॠतुमेव रामम्. It must be noted that the उपमित compound takes place only when the common property is not given.

हृदयङ्गमम्=

What is in the heart. गम् takes the affix खच् when preceded by an *upapada* as its object, when the word so formed is a proper noun. *e.g. ‘*सुतङ्गमो नाम यस्य पुत्रः सौतङ्गमिः'. This is the Sûtra"गमश्च" ३।२।४७॥ हृदयङ्गम can not well be taken as a proper noun here. Malli, shews his own अरुचि by using the word मन्यते in 'हृद्गतस्येयं संज्ञेतिमन्यते'. Jaya. says:— 'स्वानुभवं हि वस्तु हृदयङ्गममित्युच्यते तेन संज्ञायामित्यधिकृत्य गमश्चेति खच्।.' Amara gives it the sense of ‘coherent' ' संङ्गतं हृदयङ्गमम्'.But the word generally means 'lovely' 'pleasant'; *e.g.* 'हृदयङ्गमः परिहासः' Malati. Ac. 3. It is used in Raghu, and Ku. 'वल्लकी च हृदयङ्गमस्वनावल्गुवागपि च वामलोचना' (रघु० १९.१३.). ‘क्व नु ते हृदयङ्गमः सखा कुसुमायोजितकार्मुको मधुः' (कुमा० ४.२४), 'इति तेभ्यः स्तुतीः श्रुत्वा यथार्था हृदयङ्गमाः' (कुमा० २.१६).

'व्रत इति शास्त्रतो नियम उच्यते। व्रते गम्यमाने सुबन्त उपपदे धातोर्णिनिः प्रत्ययो भवति। समुदायोपाधिश्वायम्। धातूपपदप्रत्ययसमुदायेन व्रतं गम्यते। स्थण्डिलशायी। अश्राद्धभोजी। कामचारप्राप्तौ नियमः। सति शयने स्थण्डिल एव शेते नान्यत्र। सति भोजनेऽश्राद्धमेव भुङ्क्ते न श्राद्धमिति।' काशि०. So वनवर्त्तिनः means 'येषां सत्यन्यस्थाने वृत्तौ च वन एव वर्त्तितुं शास्त्रतो नियमस्ते वनवर्त्तिनः।' Jaya.

 **शूरमानी.**

मन् has खश् and णिनिaffixed to it in the sense of 'considering oneself to be what is denoted by the *upapada* of the root.’'यदा प्रत्ययार्थः कर्त्ताऽऽत्मानमेव दर्शनीयत्वादिना धर्मेण युक्तं मन्यते तदायं विधिः। दर्शनीयमात्मानं मन्यते दर्शनीयमन्यः। दर्शनीयमानी। पण्डितमन्यः। पण्डितमानी।' काशि०. Thus we have शूरमानी or शूरमन्यः। साधुमानी or साधुमन्यः.

 **अन्यव्यासक्तघातित्वात्.**

हन् takes णिनि, with an *upapada* which is its object, when the action of killing is done in the past time and when the word so formed shews censure. 'पितृव्यघाती। मातुलघाती। कुत्सितसंग्रहणं कर्त्तव्यम्। इह मा भूत्। चोरं हतवान्।' काशि०. Jaya. says:—'तत्र कुत्सितग्रहणं कर्त्तव्यमित्युक्तम्। यदि सुग्रीवेण मम विरोधः किं तवायातमिति कुत्सितहननम्।'



**ब्रह्मघ्नाम्**

. ब्रह्महन् is formed by the affix क्विप्. This affix is added to any root. The Sûtra “ब्रह्मभ्रूणवृत्रेषु क्विप्" ३।२।८७॥must therefore be taken in a limited sense. The Kâsikâ on this runs as follows:—

 'कर्मणीति वर्त्तते। ब्रह्मादिषु कर्मसूपपदेषु हन्तेर्धातोः क्विप्प्रत्ययो भवति भूते। ब्रह्महा। भ्रूणहा। वृत्रहा। किमर्थमिदमुच्यते। यावता सर्वधातुभ्यः क्विब्विहित एव। ब्रह्मादिषु हन्तेः क्विब्वचनं नियमार्थम्। चतुर्विधश्चात्र नियम इष्यते। ब्रह्मादिष्वेव हन्तेर्नान्यस्मिन्नुपपदे पुरुषं हतवानिति। ब्रह्मादिषु हन्तेरेव नान्यस्मात्स्यात् ब्रह्माधीतवानिति। ब्रह्मादिषु हन्तेर्भूतकाले क्विबेव नान्यः प्रत्ययः। तथा भूतकाल एव नान्यस्मिन् ब्रह्माणं हन्ति हनिष्यति वेति। तदेतद्वक्ष्यमाणबहुलग्रहणस्य पुरस्तादपकर्षणाल्लभ्यते।'. बहुलम् occurs in the next Sûtra "बहुलं छन्दसि" ३।२।८८. But the Bhâshya does not accept these four limitations. 'ब्रह्मादिष्वेव क्विबेवेति द्विविधो नियम इति भाष्यम्' सिद्धा० कौ०. The Bhâshya proceeds as under :—

 'किमर्थं ब्रह्मादिषु हन्तेः क्विब्विधीयते न क्विप्चान्येभ्यो दृश्यत इत्येव सिद्धम्। ब्रह्मादिषु हन्तेः क्विब्वचनं नियमार्थम्। नियमार्थोऽयमारम्भः। ब्रह्मादिष्वेव हन्तेर्भूते क्विव्यथा

** पापकृत्**.

कृ takes the affix क्विप् (The whole of क्विप् is dropped, but as it is पित्, कृ takes the augment त्by "ह्रस्वस्य पिति कृति तुक्" ६।१।७१॥) after सु, and after कर्मन्, पाप, मन्त्र, and पुण्य as its objects. Here there is a three-fold नियम; namely क्विबेव, कृञ एव, भूत एव. 'क्विबेवेति नियमात्कर्म कृतवानित्यत्राण् न। कृञ एवेति नियमान्मन्त्रमधीतवान् मन्त्राध्यायः। अत्र न क्विप्। भूत एवेति नियमात् मन्त्रं करोति करिष्यति वेति विवक्षायां न क्विप्। स्वादिष्वेवेति नियमाभावादन्यस्मिन्नप्युपपदे क्विप्। शास्त्रकृत्। भाष्यकृत्।' सिद्धा० कौ०.

** अग्निचित्.**

In अग्निचित् and सोमसुत् the Kâśikâmentions four kinds of नियम as in ब्रह्महा. 'चतुर्विधश्चात्र नियम इष्यते। धातुकालोपपदप्रत्ययविषयः'।. The word means 'one who keeps sacred fire,' आहिताग्नि.

** रथचक्रचिदादिषु.**

****रथचक्रचित्=An arrangement of bricks for fire in the form of a chariot-wheel. Malli. takes अनलेषु in the लक्ष्य sense of 'altars on which fires are kindled'. Jaya, takesरथचक्रचित् in the sense of 'fire for which bricks are arranged in the form of a chariot-wheel.' 'अग्न्यर्थो हि तदाकार इष्टकाचय इत्युच्यते तद्द्वारेणाग्निरपि।' जय०. Malli's interpretation is preferable, अग्न्याख्यायाम् in the Sûtra "कर्मण्यग्न्याख्यायाम्" ३।२।९२॥is explained in a way which supports Malli's explanation. 'अग्न्याख्यायां धातूपपदप्रत्ययसमुदायेन चेदग्न्याख्या गम्यते। ......।आख्याग्रहणं

**बुद्धिपूर्वंध्रुवन्न त्वां.**

ध्रुवन्न may be separated into ध्रुवन् न or ध्रुवम् न. ध्रुवन् and द्रुवन्, Malli's reading, have both the same sense, *viz.*आनन्. Taking either, the construction is पिता त्वा खलं द्रु (ध्रु) वन् बुद्धिपूर्वमेव न राजकृत्वा. But with ध्रुवम्, the अन्वय must be खलं त्वा पिता न राजकृत्वातत् बुद्धिपूर्वं ध्रुवम्. In this case the Acc. त्वा is not strictly correct. By the Sûtra "कर्त्तृकर्मणोः कृति" २।३।६५॥the object of the कृदन्त, राजकृत्वन्, must be used in the genitive. Malli, therefore says 'त्वामिति द्वितीया न स्यात्.' In 'धायैरामोदमुत्तमम्' (St. 80), however, Malli., says "कर्तृकर्मणोः कृति" इत्यत्र शेषत्वविवक्षायामेव षष्ठीविधानादिह तदविवक्षायामामोदमिति कर्मणि द्वितीया।'. This view, however, is not quite free from objection. The Kâśikâsays ‘शेष इति निवृत्तम्। पुनः कर्मग्रहणात्।' ( *Vide* Note on St. 80 ). Some commentators divide त्वाinto तुand आ, and understandपिता अखलम्. 'अन्ये तु इति निषेधेआशब्दः स्मरणे पीडायां वा राजकृत्वेत्यत्र तवेत्यर्थाद्गम्यते नञः प्रश्लेषात् अखलमिति मामित्यस्य वक्ष्यमाणस्य विशेषणमित्याहुः।' भर०. This is complicated and awkward.

अनूचान is one who has studied all the Vedâs with their six parts. 'साङे प्रवचने (वेदे) अधीती.'

**संभविष्यावः**

. The second Future is used in the sense of the Imperfect when the action denoted by the verb is dependant upon the principal verb, which must have the sense of 'to remember' *e.g*. 'अभिजानासि स्मरसि बुध्यसे चेतयसे वा देवदत्त कश्मीरेषु वत्स्यामः.' Here वत्स्यामः means अवसाम. If however the subordinate sentence is introduced by यद्, the second Future can not be used in the sense of the Imperfect. 'अभिजानासि देवदत्त यत्कश्मीरेष्ववसाम.'

**Stanza 142—**

 When

अभिज्ञा

or its synonym is the principal verb, and two verbs depend upon it, the action of one of which indicates that of the other,



these two verbs may be used either in the 2nd Future or in the Imperfect in the sense of the Imperfect. The two sentences may or may not have been connected by यद्. *e. g*. 'अभिजानासि देवदत्त कश्मीरेषु वत्स्यामस्तत्रौदनं भोक्ष्यामहे' or 'अभिजानासि देवदत्त कश्मीरेष्ववसाम तत्रौदनमभुञ्ज्महि'; or 'अभिजानासि देवदत्त यत्कश्मीरेषु वत्स्यामस्तत्रौदनं भोक्ष्यामहे' or 'अभिजानासि देवदत्त यत्कश्मीरेष्ववसाम तत्रौदनमभुञ्ज्महि’. In the present stanza वास is the indicator of पान.

In these verses all the roots mentioned in the Sûtra are illustrated with the exception of आयम्, दुष्, दुह्, विविच्, भज्, and अतिचर्. The forms of these ending in घिनुण् (इन्) are आयामिन्, दोषिन्, दोहिन्, विवेकिन्, भागिन्, and अतिचारिन्.

** परिमोहिणम्.**

This seems to be the correct reading and not परिमोहिनम् found in C. and N. "कृत्यचः" ८।४।२९॥teaches that न् of a कृत् affix coming after a vowel is changed to ण् when preceded by र् in a preposition. The कृत् affixes that have न् in them are अन, मान, अनीय्, अन्, इन्, and न (substitute of the Past Part. affix त). This change is necessary and not optional. 'कृत्स्थो यो नकारोऽचउत्तरस्तस्योपसर्गस्थान्निमित्तादुत्तरस्य णकारादेशो भवति। अन मान अनीय अनि इनि निष्ठादेश एते णत्वं प्रयोजयन्ति। अन। प्रयाणम्। परियाणम्। प्रमाणम्। परिमाणम्। मान। प्रयायमाणम्। परियायमाणम्। अनीय। प्रयाणीयम्। परियाणीयम्। अनिः। अप्रयाणिः। अपरियाणिः। इनि। प्रयायिणौ। परियायिणौ। निष्ठादेशः। प्रहीणः। परिहीणः। प्रहीणवान्। परिहीणवान्। अच इति किम्। प्रभुग्नः। परिभुग्नः।' काशि०.

** अभङ्गुरप्रज्ञः**

=One whose intellect is firm. घुरच् (उर्) is added to भञ्ज् in the कर्मकर्त्तरि sense. As घुरच् is घित्, ज् is changed to ग् by “चजोःकुघिण्यतोः" ७।३।५२॥(that is, च् and ज् are changd to क्, and ग् when followed by an affix which is घित् and the affix ण्यत्).'भञ्जेः कर्मकर्त्तरि प्रत्ययः स्वभावात्। भङ्गुरं काष्ठम्। घित्वात्कुत्वम्।' काशि० 'अभिधानस्वाभाव्यात् भञ्जेःकर्मकर्त्तर्य्येवायं घुरच्प्रत्ययः 'तत्त्व०. 'भञ्जेः कर्मकर्त्तर्येव अभिधानस्वभावादित्याहुः'मनो०. Thus भङ्गुरम् means स्वयमेव भज्यते. Jaya's reading is भङ्गुरप्रज्ञः 'भङ्गुरा ये स्वयमेव भज्यन्ते।......। तान् प्रजानातीति भङ्गुरप्रज्ञः।" (जय०). This does not convey a good sense. Jaya takes गत्वरान् in the sense of 'गमनशीलान् अस्थिरप्रकृतीन्'.

** विदुरः**

= One who knows well. It is formed by affixing कुरच् (उर) to विद् according to the Sûtra “विदिभिदिच्छिदेः कुरच्” ३।२।१६२॥. 'ज्ञानार्थस्य विदेर्ग्रहणं न लाभाद्यर्थस्य स्वभावात्। विदुरः पण्डितः। भिदुरं काष्ठम्। छिदुरा रज्जुः। भिदिच्छिद्योः कर्मकर्त्तरि प्रयोगः' काशि०. On this the Manoramâsays :— 'छिदुरमिति। कर्मकर्त्तरीति वृत्तिः। नैतत् भाष्ये दृष्टम्। तथा च माघः मुख्ये कर्त्तरि प्रायुङ्क्त। 'प्रियतमाय वपुर्गुरुमत्सरच्छिदुरयादुरयाचितमङ्गना इति।’. This is in Mâgha C. VI, St. 8, where 'गुरुमत्सरच्छिदुरया' qualifies परपुष्टया and is explained by Malli. as 'गुरोर्महतो द्वेषस्य छिदुरया छेश्या।“विदिभिदिच्छिदेः कुरच्"।Thus छिदुर means either 'that which cuts' or 'that which is cut of itself."

**Stanza 25—**

** स्वप्नक्**

. The word is formed by affixing नजिङ् (नज्) to स्वप् in the active sense. The same affix is added in the same sense to तृष् and धृष्. The words are स्वप्नज्, तृष्णज्, and धृष्णज्.

** ईश्वरः**

= 'ईशनशीलः' Jaya, that is, 'lording it over my wives.' The word is formed by affixing वरच् (वर) to ईश् by the Sûtra “स्थेशभासपिसकसो वरच्" ३।२।१७५॥. We have thus स्थावरः। ईश्वरः। भास्वरः। पेस्वरः। विकस्वरः।

**Stanza 27—**

**Stanza 28—**

** कारुः**

= doer. The word is formed according to the उणादि Sûtra 'कृवापाजिमिस्वदिसाध्यशूभ्य उण्'। 'करोतीति कारुः शिल्पी कारकश्च। वासीति वायुः ("आतोयुच्” ३।३।१२८॥) पायुर्गुदम्। जयत्यभिभवति रोगान् जायुरौषधम्। मिनोति प्रक्षिपति देहे उष्माणमिति मायुः पित्तम्। स्वादुः। साध्नोति परकार्यं साधुः। अश्नुते आशु शीघ्रम्।' (सिद्धा० कौ०).

**Stanza 29—**

** कारका मित्रकार्याणि**

. The genitive is not used with a word formed by the affix अकin the sense of the Future and one formed by इन in the Future sense, or in the sense of 'debtor'. In कारक अक has the Future sense, कारकाः being equal to करिष्यन्तः. 'कटं कारको व्रजति। ओदनं भोजको व्रजति। इनः खल्वपि। ग्रामं गमी। आधमर्ण्येशतं दायी। सहस्रं दायी। भविष्यदाधमर्ण्ययोरिति किम्। यवानां लावकः। सक्तूनां पायकः। अवश्यं करी कटस्य। इह कस्मान्न भवति। वर्षशतस्य पूरकः। पुत्रपौत्राणां दर्शक इति। भविष्यदधिकारे विहितस्याकस्येदं ग्रहणम्।' काशि० ण्वुल् (अक) has two senses. It is added in the active sense without reference to any particular time (कालसामान्ये), by the Sûtra "ण्वुल्तृचौ" ३।१।१३३॥. It has also the sense of the Future and is affixed to a verb which depends upon the principal verb in the sentence. This is according to the Sûtra “तुमुण्ण्वुलौ क्रियायां क्रियार्थायाम्" ३।३।१०॥ (*e.g*. कृष्णं द्रष्टुं याति, कृष्णं दर्शको याति). The genitive is prohibited with ण्वुल्which has the Future sense. 'यस्तु कालसामान्ये ण्वुलभिहितस्तस्य नायं निषेधकस्तेन ओदनस्य पाचकः, पुत्रस्य दर्शक इत्यादैस्यादेवेति भावः'।.

**Stanza 31—**

** साधयिष्यामः**

. Jaya's reading is **सादयिष्यामः** which means 'व्यापादयिष्यामः’ = we shall kill.

** करिष्यन्तः**

स्यत्,

the termination of the second Future, is used in two ways. It is added to a root which may or may not be connected with another verb as depending upon it. "लृट्शेषे च" ३।३।१३॥ 'शेषः क्रियार्थोपपदादन्यः। शेषे शुद्धे भविष्यति काले चकारात् क्रियायां चोपपदे क्रियार्थायां धातोर्लृट् प्रत्ययो भवति। करिष्यामीति व्रजति। हरिष्यामीति व्रजति। शेषे खल्वपि। करिष्यति। हरिष्यति।' काशि०. In this verse करिष्यन्तः is not connected with any verb, while साधयिष्यामः depends upon आसेदुः, करिष्यन्त इत्यत्र शुद्धे भविष्यदर्थे लृट्।साधयिष्याम इत्यत्र क्रियार्थक्रियोपपदे भविष्यदर्थे लृट्।

** एकनिश्चायम्**.

Mark the difference between निश्चय and निश्चाय. निश्चय is 'determination’, whileनिश्चाय is 'heap.' निश्चाय is परिमाणवाचक. Malli. takes एकनिश्चायमागतम् as qualifying कपिसमाहारम्. It means 'A large number of monkeys that had come in one lot.’ Jaya. takes एकनिश्चायमागतम् with आयामम्. 'एकनिश्चायमागतमेकराशितां प्राप्तमायाममित्यर्थः।' (जय०). Bharatamallika also takes it similarly. 'कीदृशमायामम्। एकं निश्चायं ज्ञानमागतं प्राप्तमत्यभ्यासात् सर्वासां दिशां दैर्घ्यं सुग्रीवस्य ज्ञानारूढमित्यर्थः' (भर०). He also says:—'एको निश्चायो निश्चयो यस्येति कपिसमाहारस्य विशेषणं वा। एतेन एकवाक्यता दर्शिता।' Bharatamallika takes निश्चाय in the same sense as निश्चय. Malli's interpretation seems to be the best.

** जाम्बवन्नीलसहितम्**

**.** Malli takes the whole as a compound, taking the first word as जाम्बवत्, He criticizes those who take the word as अकारान्त, *i.e.* जाम्बव. By 'केचित्' he means Jaya and others. Jaya. says:—'जाम्बवं ऋक्षाधिपतिम्।.....। 'जाम्बवशब्दोऽकारान्तो द्रष्टव्यः।'. It is not quite clear why Malli. says 'चिन्त्यम्' Bharatamallika quotes Vishvakosha to show that the word is अकारान्त also. 'जाम्बवान् जाम्बवोऽपि च' इति विश्वः। However जाम्बवत् is the form of the word generally found, in the Râmâyaṇa and other Purâṇas.

**Stanza 37—**

**सदोद्गारसुगन्धीनाम्**

'सदा सर्वदा उद्गारे भक्षणानन्तरं श्वसनपूर्वके शब्दोच्चारणे यानि सुगन्धीनि तेषाम्'. 'यद्भुक्तं सदुद्गारेऽपि सुगन्धिं प्रकाशयति तदुद्गारसुगन्धि।' भर०. For the change of गन्ध to गन्धि (*vide* notes on C. II. St. 10).

** आशिताः**

= Satisfied (those that have eaten their fill ). It is active in sense. (*vide* notes on C. IV. St. 11). The use of the genitive with the word is to be understood by the fact that षष्ठीसमास is prohibited with it by the Sûtra "पूरणगुणसुहितार्थसदव्ययतव्यसमानाधिकरणेन"२/२/११. "सुहिता-



र्थास्तृप्त्यर्थाः। फलानां सुहितः।'. If the genitive case were not used with the word, there would be no meaning in prohibiting षष्ठीसमासwith it.

 Mark the difference between उत्कार, which means धान्यराशि, 'heap of corn' and उत्कर which means 'any collection' as भिक्षोत्कर. So निकार is धान्यराशि, and निकर is any समूह as पुष्पनिकर. It is only in the sense of 'the throwing up of corn' that कॄtakes घञ्.

**Stanza 39 —**

 संस्ताव

= Singing together, hymning in chorus. It is explained in the Kâśikâ and Kaumudîas meaning 'a place where Brâhmaṇas meet to sing the Sâma-Veda, 'समेत्य स्तुवन्ति यस्मिन्देशे छन्दोगाः स देशः संस्तावः।' सिद्धा० कौ० 'संस्तावश्छन्दोगानाम्। समेत्य स्तुवन्ति यस्मिन्देशे छन्दोगाः स देशः संस्ताव इत्युच्यते। संस्तवश्छात्रयोः।' काशि०. संस्तव generally means परिचय.

 प्रस्तार.

Note the difference between प्रस्तार and प्रस्तर. Both mean 'spreading out, collection'; but the former is used when the description is not connected with a sacrifice. 'स्तृञ् आच्छादने। अस्माद्धातोः प्रशब्दे उपपदे घञ्प्रत्ययो भवति न चेद्यज्ञविषयः प्रयोगो भवति। शङ्खप्रस्तारः। मणिप्रस्तारः।' काशि०.

** न्याय्यम्**

. न्याय and परिणाय are formed by affixing घञ् (अand changing the vowel to its Vṛiddhi) to इ with नि and नी with परिrespectively in the sense of 'non-deviation' and 'moving pieces in chess’ respectively, *e.g.* परिणायेन शारान् घ्नन्ति। समन्तान्नयनेनेत्यर्थः। एषोऽत्र न्यायः यथाप्राप्तकरणमित्यर्थः। परिणय = marriage and न्यय= destruction, न्ययं गतः पापः। नाशं गत इत्यर्थः।

** पर्याय**

means क्रमप्राप्तस्यानतिपातः, *i.e.*'regular order,’ while पर्यय means 'lapse'; *e.g.* कालस्य पर्ययः। अतिपात इत्यर्थः।

 निशोपशायः

. उपशाय is used in the sense of 'sleeping by turns,’ while उपाशयsimply means 'sleeping near.' It does not convey the



idea of पर्याय. Similarly विशाय = sleeping by turns, while विशय = संशय (doubt).

 **फलोच्चायः**

. चि takes the affix घञ् when the idea of taking by hand or proximity and not steeling is conveyed.

 'हस्तादानग्रहणेन प्रत्यासत्तिरादेयस्य लक्ष्यते। पुष्पप्रचायः। फलप्रचायः। हस्तादान इति किम्। वृक्षशिखरे फलप्रचयं करोति ('वृक्षाग्रस्थानां फलानां यष्ट्याप्रचयं करोति’ सिद्धा० कौ०)। अस्तेय इति किम्। पुष्पप्रचयश्चौर्येण।' काशि०. The word उच्चयdoes not convey any such idea. 'उच्चयस्य प्रतिषेधो वक्तव्यः'. This Vârtika seems to have escaped Malli.'s notice when he quotes Vallabha on पुष्पोच्चय in his Com.on Kumârasambhava C. 3, St. 61. 'पुष्पोच्चयः पुष्पप्रकरः। "हस्तादाने चेरस्तेये" इति घञ्विषयत्वात्कवीनामयं प्रामादिकः प्रयोग इति वल्लभः।' Malli. does not refer to the 'उच्चयस्य प्रतिषेधो वक्तव्यः' which is an exception to the Sûtra "हस्तादाने चेरस्तेये" ३।३।४०॥. It must be stated, however, that this difference between प्रचाय and प्रचय is not strictly observed in usage.

 विनतः

= Name of a monkey. Jaya. takes it to mean 'one who had bowed.' 'विनतः प्रणतः सुग्रीव इत्यर्थात्' (जय०). This is not good विनतmust be here taken as a proper noun. The Râmâyaṇa describes what monkeys were sent to what directions :—

'उत्तरां तु दिशं रम्यां गिरिराजसमावृताम्॥  
प्रतस्थे सहसा वीरो हरिः शतबलिस्तदा।  
पूर्वां दिशं प्रतिययौ विनतो हरियूथपः॥  
ताराङ्गदादिसहितः प्लवगः पवनात्मजः।

पश्चिमां च दिशं घोरां सुषेणः प्लवगेश्वरः।

 Thus we see that शतबलि, विनत, हनुमत्, and सुषेण were sent respectively to the northern, eastern, southern, and western directions.

ग्लहम्

. ग्लह = stake. The word occurs in Mâgha 'व्यात्युक्षीमभिसरणग्लहामदीव्यन्’ ८-३२. There Malli.'s remarks on ग्लह are :— "अक्षेषु ग्लहः” इति ग्रहेरेवाक्षपणे लत्वनिपातः। अप्प्रत्ययस्तु "ग्रहवृदृनिश्चिगमश्च" इत्येव सिद्ध इति केचित्। अन्ये तु ग्लहिंप्रकृत्यन्तरमङ्गीकृत्याप्प्रत्ययस्यैव निपातो घञपवादीत्याहुः।'

**Stanza 63—**



**अन्तर्घने**

. अन्तर्घन or अन्तर्घण is formed according to Pâṇini by adding अप् to हन् and changing it to घन्. It conveys the sense of 'a region in वाहीक (the Punjaub) country'. Here, however, it means the space between the outward entrance and the door. 'द्वारमतिक्रम्य यः सावकाशप्रदेशः सोऽन्तर्घण इत्युच्यते।' जय०.

** लौहोद्धनघनस्कन्धाः**

उद्धन is generally a large wooden block on which carpenters place their wood while fashioning it. 'यस्मिन् काष्ठे



अन्यानि काष्ठानि स्थापयित्वा तक्षन्ते तदुद्धनः' सिद्धा० कौ०. Amara also explains the word similarly 'निधाय तक्ष्यते यत्र काष्ठेकाष्ठं स उद्धनः' (अम०). But our commentator explains it to mean 'an iron block for blacksmiths to fashion their iron upon'. We have लो (or लौ) होद्धन and not काष्ठोद्धनin the text. It is this that has led Malli, to explain it thus .

 

अपघन

is formed by affixing अप् to अपहन् and changing it to घन्. It has the sense of अङ्ग, अङ्ग is not the whole body but hands and feet. 'अङ्गं शरीरावयवः। स चेह न सर्वः किन्तु पाणिः पादश्चेत्याहुः।’In अपघन, the affix अप् has the sense of करण. 'अपहन्यते अनेन इति अपघनम्।' Here, however, it seems to mean any limb, all limbs, or the whole body. Amara gives it as a synonym of अङ्ग 'अङ्गं प्रतीकोऽवयवोऽपघनः’.

 अयोधनमुष्टयः

** दानवोऽसौ.**

This was Maya who was slain by Indra, when he was attached to the damsel Hemâ. The story is thus described by Svayamprabhâ in the Râmâyaṇa:—

 As the demon was killed by Indra, the enemy of Bala, and not by Vishṇu, the enemy of Bali, बलद्विषा is a better reading than बलिद्रुहा adopted by Malli.

** विद्येव.**

It may be taken to mean तत्वज्ञान, as it is qualified by व्रज्यावती. Excellent learning, that knowledge of reality leads out (*i.e*. out of संसार) according to their desire those who curb their senses (निरुद्धाक्षान्-अक्ष meaning इन्द्रिय) and who give themselves up to concentration (अनुष्ठितक्रियान्).

 उपधाभेदभीरवः

= Afraid because they could not accomplish the work which was entrusted to them after they had been examined and found fit to do it. उपधा means 'examination'. Malli. here takes it in its लक्ष्य (secondary) sense of 'the accomplishment of work resulting from examination.' That is, when a work is entrusted to servants after their capacity for it has been examined, it is quite sure to be effected. Jaya,'s note is :— 'उपधानमुपधा परीक्षा। तत्परिशुद्धो हि भृत्यः कार्येषु नियुज्यते। तदकरणादुपधाया भेदोऽभावस्तस्माद्भीरवः।' जय०.

 Malli.'s taking

**एषः**

to mean वानरगणः and supplying एषः पक्षी as the subject of 'अभ्येति' is awkward. The verse may be thus construed :- 'बुभुक्षया परिग्लानः एषः (पक्षी) अस्मानत्तुमितः (अस्मिन् प्रदेशे) अभ्येति (अत एव) अशुभक्रियः परत्र ईषदाढ्यङ्करः न'. Jaya.'s explanation of the verse is as follows:—

 'य एष अस्मानत्तुमितः प्रदेशादभ्येति आगच्छति स परत्र परलोके ईषदाढ्यङ्करोऽपि अनाढ्यैराषदाढ्योऽपि न कृतः। अशुभेन कर्मणेत्यर्थात्। यतः परिग्लानो बुभुक्षया यो हि कर्मणा शुभेन ईषदाढ्यङ्करोऽपि न कृतः स कथं न बुभुक्षया पीड्यते।

 Malli.'s reading is

अहोऽतीतम्

. The Sandhi here is ungrammatical, the rule being that अहन् changes its न्to र् when followed by what is not a case-ending; *e.g.* अहर्ददाति। अहर्भुङ्क्ते।, but we have अहोभिः, Sandhi of अहन्+अतीतम् should thus be अहर्+अतीतम् =अहरतीतम्. With अहर्यातम्, there is no difficulty.

**Stanza 92—**

 कौशल्यायनिवल्लभाम्

. कौशल्यायानिis formed by affixing फिञ् in the sense of अपत्य to कोसल. Before affixing the termination कोसल is changed to कौसल्य. Jaya's derivation 'कौशल्याया अपत्यं कौशल्यायनी रामः' is not supported by the Kâśika, Kaumudî, or Bhâshya. 'परमप्रकृतेरेवायं प्रत्यय इष्यते (*i.e*. though the Sûtra is "कौसल्यकार्मार्याभ्यां च" ४।१।१५५॥, the affix फिञ् is not added to कौसल्य and कार्मार्थ but to their original basis कोसल and कर्मार)। कोसलस्यापत्यं कर्मारस्यापत्यमिति। प्रत्ययसन्नियोगेन तु प्रकृतिरूपं निपात्यते। तथा च स्मृत्यन्तरम्। दगुकोसलकर्मारछागवृषाणां युद्धादिष्टस्य। दागव्यायनिः। कौसल्यायनिः। कार्मार्यायणिः। छाग्यायनिः। वार्ष्यायनिः।' काशि०.

** कौमारीम्**

= The wife of one who has not married another wife. The husband of one who has not married another husband is called कौमार. 'अपूर्वपतिं कुमारीं पतिरुपपन्नः कौमारः पतिः। अपूर्वपतिः कुमारी पतिमुपपन्ना कौमारी भार्या।' सिद्धा० कौ० and काशि०. Bha. Malli. suggests other explanations also :—'कौमारीं जितकार्त्तिकेयभार्यामतिरूपवतीमित्यर्थः। कुमारस्य कार्त्तिकेयस्य पत्नी कुमारी। स्कन्दो मन्दमतिर्विवाहविमुखो धत्ते कुमारव्रतमिति काल्पनिकम्। न तु प्रकृतम्। देवसेना नामेन्द्रकन्या कार्त्तिकेयस्य पत्नी प्रसिद्धा तथा हि 'शतक्रतो रूपवती देवसेनेति वै सुता। सा महेन्द्रेण रत्यर्थं भार्यार्थेनोपपादिता॥’ इति स्कन्दपुराणीयं वचनममरकोषटीकायां मधुमाधवेन धृतम्। अथोपयन्त्रा सदृशेन युक्तां स्कन्देन साक्षादिव देवसेनामिति कालिदासः। कुमारीं जयतीति ...। किं वा कौ पृथिव्यां मारी माया लक्ष्म्या रीर्गतिर्यस्यां लक्ष्मीरूपामित्यर्थः। ..... किं वा कुमार एव कौमारः। कौमारस्य भार्यां रामस्य प्रथमपत्नीमित्यर्थः।'.

 'यत्तु प्राचोक्तं "दुह्याच्यर्थरुधिप्रच्छचिब्रूशासुजिकर्मयुक्। नीहृकृष्मन्थवहदण्ड्ग्रहमुष्पचकर्मभाक्॥” इति। अत्रेदं वक्तव्यं ग्रहेः पाठो निर्मूलः जग्राह द्युतरुं शक्रमित्युदाहरणमप्ययुक्तम्॥'

** समगध्वम्**

= We wish you may go. By the Sûtra "आशंसायां भूतवच्च" ३।३।१३२॥ the Aorist is optionally used in the sense of the Future when hope is implied. 'आशंसनमाशंसा। अप्राप्तस्य प्रियार्थस्य प्राप्तुमिच्छा। तस्याश्च भविष्यत्कालो विषयः।तत्र भविष्यति काले आशंसायां गम्यमानायां धातोर्वा भूतवत्प्रत्यया भवन्ति। चकाराद्वर्त्तमानवच्च। उपाध्यायश्चंदागमत्। आगतः। आगच्छति। आगमिष्यति। एते व्याकरणमध्यगीष्महि। एते व्याकरणमधीतवन्तः। अधीमहे। अध्येष्यामहे। सामान्यातिदेशे विशेषानतिदेशाल्लङ्लिटौ न भवतः। आशंसायामिति किम्। आगमिष्यति।'



काशि०. Thus the Aorist, the Present, and the Future are used when hope is implied.



मोदयध्वम्

. The reading 'आहध्वं मा रघूत्तमम् noted by Malli. is noticed by Bha. Dî. The Sûtra "आङो यमहनः’ १।३।२८॥teaches that यम् and हन् take Para. terminations when they are intransitive or if transitive have for their object a word denoting a limb of the speaker. 'यम उपरमे। हन हिंसागत्योरिति परस्मैपदिनौ। ताभ्यामकर्मकक्रियावचनाभ्यामाङ्पूर्वाभ्यामात्मनेपदं भवति। आयच्छते। हनः खल्वपि। आहते। अकर्मकादित्येव। आयच्छति कूपाद्रज्जुम्। आहन्ति वृषलं पादेन। स्वाङ्गकर्मकाच्चेति वक्तव्यम्। आयच्छते पाणिम्। आहते शिरः। स्वाङ्गं चेह न पारिभाषिकं गृह्यते। किं तर्हि। स्वमङ्गं स्वाङ्गम्। तेनेह न भवति। आहन्ति शिरः परकीयमिति।' काशि०. Now the question arises how the Atma. form in ‘आहध्वं मा रघूत्तमम्' is to be explained, 'कथं तर्हि "आजघ्ने विषमविलोचनस्य वक्षः" इति भारविः। "आहध्वं मा रघूत्तमम्" इति भट्टिश्च। प्रमाद एवायमिति भागवृत्तिः। प्राप्येत्यध्याहारो वा। "ल्यब्लोपे पञ्चमी” इति तु ल्यबन्तं विनैव तदर्थावगतिर्यत्र तद्विषयकम्। भेत्तुमित्यादि तुमुन्नन्ताध्याहारो वा। समीपमेत्येति वा।' सिद्धा० कौ०. *Vide* Malli.'s Com, on “आजघ्ने" in "आजघ्ने विषमविलोचनस्य वक्षः" किरा० १७-६३.

** नोपायध्वम् (मोपायध्वम्)**

. Malli. says that the root is here transitive and therefore Âtms is inadmissible. We think the Âtma, can be explained by the Sûtra "समुदाङ्भ्यो यमोऽग्रन्थे" १।३।७५॥. यम् with सम्, उद् and आ takes Âtma, when the sense of the verb has no connection with ग्रन्थ (a book). With आ, यम् is Âtma. when intransitive by the Sûtra "आङो यमहनः" १।३।२८॥.In the Sûtra "समुदाङ्भ्यो यमोऽग्रन्थे" आ is mentioned to shew that even when transitive, takes Âtma. terminations, provided the sense is not connected with ग्रन्थ. 'आङ्पूर्वादकर्मकात् "आङो यमहनः" इति सिद्धमेवात्मनेपदम्। सकर्मकार्थमिदं पुनर्ग्रहणम्। अग्रन्थ इति किम्। उद्यच्छति चिकित्सां वैद्यः। कर्त्रभिप्राय इत्येव। संयच्छति। उद्यच्छति। आयच्छति।' काशि०.

** अधिशयितम्.**

Here the past participle termination त has the sense of अधिकरण (place).

** तरुमृगोत्तमम्.**

It must be taken as सप्तमीतत्पुरुष, as षष्ठीतत्पुरुष is prohibited by "न निर्धारणे"॥No compound takes place between नृणाम् and श्रेष्ठः in नृणां द्विजः श्रेष्ठः. But we have the compound पुरुषोत्तमः. How is this then to be explained ? 'अथ कथं पुरुषोत्तम इति। यस्मान्निर्धार्यते यश्चैकदेशो निर्धार्यते यश्च निर्धारणे हेतुरेतत्त्रितयसंनिधाने सत्येवायं निषेध इति "द्विवचनविभज्योपपद—" इति सूत्रे कैयटः। यद्वा पुरुषेषु उत्तमः इति "संज्ञायाम्" इति निर्धारणसप्तम्याः समासः। न चैवं "न निर्धारणे" इति व्यर्थम्। स्वरे भेदात्। सप्तमीसमासे हि पूर्वपदप्रकृतिस्वरः। षष्ठीसमासे त्वन्तोदात्तत्वं स्यात्।' मनो० तरुमृमोत्तमम् is not a संज्ञा; सप्तमीतत्पुरुष compound should therefore be formed by detaching the part सप्तमी from the whole Sûtra, "सप्तमी शौण्डैः" २।१।४०॥and understanding it to mean that a word in the locative case can be compounded with any word having a case-ending (सप्तम्यन्तं सुबन्तेन सह समस्यते) 'तरुमृगेषु वानरेषूत्तममिति सप्तमीति योगविभागात्सः।' जय०.

The change of द्to न् made by “यरोऽनुनासिकेऽनुनासिको वा” is therefore असिद्ध (as it were not made) in the view of "अट्कुप्वाङ्नुम्व्यवायेऽपि" by "पूर्वत्रासिद्धम्” ८।२।१।. Thus न् is not changed to ण्, because the Sûtra "अट्कुप्वाङ्–" does not see the नत्व, brought above by "यरोऽनुनासिके—" the latter being subsequent to the former (त्रिपाद्यामपि परं शास्त्रं पूर्वं प्रत्यसिद्धं स्यात्).

 "The story originated from the double sense which the word *parvata*bears in the Vedas. It denotes "a mountain" and "a cloud" also. Indra was the god who prevented the clouds from flying from place to place, and compelled them to discharge their freight on the earth for the benefit of his human worshippers' \[Dr. Bhândârkara's "Early History of the Dekkan" p. 48 footnote 3).

**उद्यच्छमानाभिः**

XVI. St. 29 'उद्यच्छमाना गमनाय पश्चात् पुरो निवेशे पथि चव्रजन्ती'. ThereMalli says:—'उद्यच्छमानोद्योगं कुर्वती। "समुदाङ्भ्यो यमोऽग्रन्थे" इत्यस्य सकर्मकाधिकारत्वादात्मनेपदम्॥



 The definitions of लीला, किलकिञ्चित, and विभ्रम, given by Malli. are from Dhanaṅjaya's Daśarûpa. लीला is defined there as 'प्रियानुकरणं लीला मधुराङ्गविचेष्टितैः'. Viśvanâtha in his Sâhityadarpaṇa defines it as 'अङ्गैर्वेशैरलंकारैः प्रेमभिर्वचनैरपि। प्रीतिप्रयोजितैर्लीलां प्रियस्यानुकृतिं विदुः॥'.The following instance is given to illustrate it :—

'मृणालव्यालवल्या वेणीबन्धकपर्दिनी।  
हरानुकारिणी पातु लीलया पार्वती जगत्॥'

 Dhanaṅjaya gives the following instance to illustrate किलकिञ्चितः—

'रतिक्रीडाद्यन्ते कथमपिसमासाद्य समयं  
मया लब्धे तस्याः क्वणितकणकण्ठार्धमधरे।  

कृतभ्रूभङ्गासौ प्रकटितविलक्षार्धरुदित-  
स्मितक्रोधोद्धान्तं पुनरपि विदध्यान्मयिमुखम्॥'

 Viśvanâtha's definition is :—

'स्मितशुष्करुदितहसितत्रासक्रोधश्रमादीनाम्।  
साङ्कर्यं किलकिञ्चितमभीष्टतमसङ्गमादिजाद्धर्षात्॥'

 The instance given to illustrate it is:—

**'पाणिरोधमविरोधितवाञ्छं भर्त्सनाश्च मधुरस्मितगर्भाः।  
कामिनः स्म कुरुते करभोरूर्हारि शुष्करुदितं च सुखेऽपि॥'**

 किलकिञ्चित is the form of the word generally met with, and not किलिकिञ्चित found in the Com.

 Dhanaṅjaya illustrates विभ्रम by the following instance :—

'अभ्युद्गते शशिनि पेशलकान्तदूती—  
संलापसंवलितलोचनमानसाभिः।  
अग्राहिमण्डनविधिर्विपरीतभूषा—  
विन्यासहासितसखिजनमङ्गनाभिः॥'

 Viśvanâtha definesविभ्रम as follows:—

**"त्वरया हर्षरागादेर्दयितागमनादिषु।  
अस्थानभूषणादीनां विन्यासो विभ्रमो मतः॥'**

 His instance is :—

'श्रुत्वायान्तं बहिः कान्तमसमाप्तविभूषया  
भालेऽञ्जनं दृशोर्लाक्षा कपोले तिलकः कृतः॥'

 लीला, किलकिञ्चित, and विभ्रम are among the natural amorous gestures of women. They are ten in all,



'लीला विकासो विच्छित्तिर्विभ्रमः किलकिञ्चितम्।

**Stanza 56—**

** अविबोधयन्**. A causal form takes Âtma. terminations when the fruit of the action goes to the agent. ("णिचश्च१।३।७४॥). *e.g*. कटं कारयते। ओदनं पाचयते, but कटं कारयति परस्य. But the causal forms of बुध्, युध्, नश्, जन्, अधी, प्रु, द्रु, and स्रु take Para. terminations even if the fruit of the action goes to the agent (“बुधयुधनशजनेङ्प्रुद्रुस्रुभ्यो णेः" १।३।८६॥). On this Sûtra, the Kâśika says :—'येऽत्राकर्मकास्तेषाम् "अणावकर्मकाच्चित्तवत्कर्त्तृकात्" इत्येव सिद्धे वचनमिदमचित्तवत्कर्त्तृकार्थम्। बोधयति पद्मम्। योधयन्ति काष्ठानि। नाशयति दुःखम्। जनयति सुखम्।' काशि०. The Vṛittikâra means that the intransitive roots mentioned in the Sûtra "बुधयुध—" take Para, when the agent of the primitive root is a sentient being by the Sûtra "अणावकर्मकाच्चित्तवत्कर्त्तृकात्" १।३।८८॥ (*e.g*. आस्ते देवदत्तः। आसयति देवदत्तम्). But युध्, नश्, जन्, which are intransitive are mentioned in the Sûtra to shew that they take Para. even if the agent of the primitive root is a non-sentient object; as in बोधयति पद्मम् &c. where the primitive forms are बुध्यते पद्मम् &c. Further on the Kâśika says :—'येऽत्र चलनार्था अपि तेषां "निगरणचलनार्थेभ्यश्च" (१।३।८७॥) इति सिद्धे यदा न चलनार्थास्तदर्थं वचनम्। प्रवते प्राप्नोतीति गम्यते। अयो द्रवति विलीयते इत्यर्थः। कुण्डिका स्रवति स्यन्दत इत्यर्थः। तद्विषयाण्युदाहरणानि॥'

**Stanza 63—**

** परिमोहयमानाभिः**

, The word is either परिमोहयमाना or परिमोहयमाणा. The rule is that न् belonging to a कृत् affix, following a vowel, is changed to ण्when the कृदन्त follows a preposition containing र्. "कृत्यचः" ८।४।२९॥ 'कृत्स्थो यो नकारोऽच उत्तरस्तस्योपसर्गस्थान्निमित्तादुत्तरस्य णकारादेशो भवति। अन मान अनीय अनि इनि निष्ठादेश एते णत्वं प्रयोजयन्ति। अन। प्रयाणम्। .... मान। प्रयायमाणम्। .......। अनीय। प्रयाणीयम्। ... अनिः। अप्रयाणिः।इनि। प्रयायिणौ। ... निष्ठादेशः। प्रहीणः। ....। अच इति किम्। प्रभुग्नः।'. But the न्belonging to a कृत्affix added to a causal base is optionally changed to ण्when the कृदन्त follows a preposition containing र् ("णेर्विभाषा" ८।४।३०॥). We have प्रयापणम् or प्रयापनम्, प्रयाप्यमाणम् or प्रयाप्यमानम्, प्रयापणीयम् or प्रयापनीयम्, अप्रयापणिः or अप्रयापनिः, प्रयापिणौ or प्रयापिनौ. Thus the words are परिमोहयमान or परिमोहयमाण.

क्रुधद्रुहेत्यादिना संप्रदानम्।’असूथत may better be taken as a denominative from असू. Because the दिवादि सू means 'to give birth'षूङ्प्राणिप्रसवे'. 'असु उपतापे। असू। असूञ् इत्येके। अस्यति। असूयति। असूयते।' सिद्धा० कौ० असु and असू are in the कण्ड्वादिgroup and hence य is added to them by "कण्ड्वादिभ्यो यक्" ३।१।२७॥.

. In Sanskrit the Demonstrative pronoun, which is a correlative to the Relative pronoun, agrees in gender with the Predicate and not the Relative pronoun. 'परस्त्रीभ्यो यदीक्षितव्यमयं (not तत्) रक्षसां स्वधर्मः'. The Demonstrative अयम् is Mas.; because the Predicate (विधेय) स्वधर्मः is Mas.and विधेय has predominance in the sentence (विधेयप्राधान्यात् पुल्लिङ्गनिर्देशः ).

**Stanza 82—**

 The first half of the verse is an instance of निदर्शना. This figure of speech arises when the connection between two sentences does not come out and to bring it about औपम्य or similarity between them as between उपमान and उपमेय is to be implied. 'अभवन् वस्तुसंबन्ध उपमापरिकल्पकः' is Mammata's definition of it. In the present verse the connection between the two sentences 'यः पयो दोग्धि पाषाणम्' and 'स रामाद्भूतिमाप्नुयात्' does not come out. How is one who extracts milk from stones one who would get prosperity from Rama? Thus to bring about connection between them we have to think that the one is like the other. The result is उपमा between two sentences (उपमायां पर्यवसानम्). This is शाब्दी निदर्शना as in the following instance generally given by Âlankârikas :—

'त्वत्पादनखरत्नानि यो रञ्जयति यावकैः।  
इन्दुंचन्दनलेपेन पाण्डुरीकुरुते हि सः॥'



 An instance of आर्थी निदर्शना is :—

 From this verse to verse 93 are enumerated what are known as कर्मप्रवचनीय words Certain prepositions are called कर्मप्रवचनीय when they are not connected with verbs, or when connected with verbs in particular senses. They are then neither गतिसंज्ञक uor उपसर्गसंज्ञक. They are enumerated by Pâṇini from the Sûtra "अनुर्लक्षणे" १।४।८४॥ to "अधिरीश्वरे" १।४।९७. The cases which they govern in particular connections are also given from the Sûtra "कर्मप्रवचनीययुक्ते द्वितीया” २।३।८॥ to the Sûtra "प्रतिनिधिप्रतिदाने च यस्मात्" २।३।११.

**अपि स्तुहि, अपि सेध**

and

**अपि सिञ्चेः**

. In the first two अपि implies कामचार (acting according to one's desire ) and in the last गर्हा (censure). It is therefore कर्मप्रवचनसंज्ञक, not उपसर्गसंज्ञक. The स् of स्तु and सिच्, which is changed to ष् when following any vowel except अ or आ in an उपसर्ग according to the Sûtra "उपसर्गात् सुनोतिसुवतिस्यतिस्तौतिस्तोभविस्थासेनयसेधसिचसञ्जस्वञ्जाम्" ८।३।६५॥ is not here changed to ष् ; because अपि is not उपसर्गसंज्ञक here.

** अधिकर्त्ता**

. Here अधि may or may not be taken as कर्मप्रवचनीयसंज्ञक. अधि with कृ is either उपसर्ग or कर्मप्रवचनीय ('विभाषा कृञि" १।४।९८॥).

**रावणाय नमस्कुर्याः**

. Both Jaya. and Malli. explain the dative. रावणाय according to the Sûtra "नमः स्वस्तिस्वाहास्वधालंवषड्योगाच्च" २।३।१६॥. Bha. Dî, however, says—:'उपपदविभक्तेः कारकविभक्तिर्बलीयसी। नमस्करोति देवान्।'. If the dative is used with नमस्कृ, it is to be explained according to his view by “क्रियार्थोपपदस्य च कर्मणि स्थानिनः" २।३।१४।He says:—"नमस्कुर्मोनृसिंहाय नृसिंहमनुकूलयितुमित्यर्थः।’. Thus रावणाय नमस्कुर्याः=रावणमनुकूलयितुं नमस्कुर्याः.

 Jaya, notices नमस्कृत्वा and नमस्कृत्य as two variants for नमस्कुर्याः. He says :—

. The genitive रावणस्य is to be explained by the Sûtra "रुजार्थानां भाववचनानामज्वरेः" २।३।५४॥.Roots having the sense of रुज् ('to be affected with a malady') except ज्वर्govern the genitive (*i.e.* शेषे षष्ठी, the accusative also can be used when the genitive is not desired), provided the agent of the action denoted by them is an abstract noun.'रुजार्थानां धातूनां भाववचनानां भावकर्त्तृकाणां ज्वरिवर्जितानां कर्मणि कारके शेषत्वेन विवक्षिते षष्ठी विभक्तिर्भवति। चौरस्य रुजति रोगः। चौरस्यामयत्यामयः। रुजार्थानामिति किम्।

 In Malli's reading कपीनां भीरु विक्रमाः, विक्रमाः, a abstract noun, is the subject of रोक्ष्यन्ति.

** कपिमहीधरः**.

Malli. takes it as मयूरव्यंसकादि and says the figure is रूपक; because अचलन &c. are साधक, meaning रूपकसाधक. We think, however, that त्रासाप्राप्ति is रूपकबाधक. त्रस् means 'to fear' (त्रसी उद्वेग) and उद्वेग or भय (as Malli, puts it 'त्रासं भयम्') is a quality of a sentient being. It can not refer to पर्वत. We should therefore solve the compound as कपिर्महीधर इव कपिमहीधरः (उपमितसमास ).

**Stanza 17—**

** प्रमेदिताः**

**.** मिद् is आदित्, being quoted in Dhâtupâṭha as ञिमिदा स्नेहने. The Past Part. affix त does nor takethe augment इ in the case of roots of which आis इत्. *e.g.* ञिमिदा मिन्नः। ञिक्ष्विदा- क्ष्विण्णः। ञिष्विदास्विन्नः।. But इ is optionally prefixed to त in the case of आदित roots, in the sense of भाव (abstract sense) and आदिकर्मन् (beginning of action). Thus we have मिन्नमनेन or मेदितमनेन। मिन्नः or मेदितः meaning मेदितुमारब्धः Similarly प्रमेदिताः means प्रकर्षेण मेदितुमारब्धाः.

** फाण्टचित्रा॰**

. फाण्ट a kind of decoction easily prepared.

The Sûtra which explains the word is "क्षुब्वस्वान्तध्वान्तलग्नम्लिष्टविरिब्धफाण्टबाढानि मन्थमनस्तमःसक्ताविस्पष्टस्वरानायासभृशेषु” ७।२।१८॥ क्षुभ् forms क्षुब्ध as its Past Part in the sense of मन्थ. 'क्षुब्ध इति भवति मन्याभिधानं चेत्। क्षुब्धो मन्थः। क्षुभितमन्यत्। क्षुभितं मन्थेन क्षुब्धो गिरिः नदीत्येवमाद्युपमानाद्भविष्यति।' काशि०. The two words with their two senses are found in 'शोभैव मन्दरक्षुब्धक्षुभिताम्भोधिवर्णना' (माघ.२. १०७ ) स्वन् forms स्वान्त in the sense of 'the mind'. 'स्वान्तमिति मनोभिधानं चेत्। स्वनितमन्यत्। स्वनितो मृदङ्गः। स्वनितं मनसा।'. ध्वन् has ध्वान्त in the sense of 'darkness'. 'ध्वान्तमिति भवति तमोभिधानं चेत्। ध्वनितमन्यत्। ध्वनितो मृदङ्गः। ध्वनितं मनसा।' लग् has लग्न in the sense of 'attached'.

'म्लिष्टमिति भवति अविस्पष्टं चेत्। म्लेच्छितमन्यत् । इत्वमप्येकारस्य निपातनादेव।' विरेभ्has विरिब्ध in the sense of 'sound'. 'विरिब्ध-

In another sense the forms are धर्षित and शसित. परिवृह्or परिवृंह् (वृह वृहि वृद्धौ ) has परिवृढ in the sense of ‘master' and परिवृहित or परिवृंहित in another sense. कष् forms कष्ट when it means 'woful, impenetrable' 'कष्टं दुःखं तत्कारणं च। स्यात्कष्टं कृच्छ्रमाभीलम्। कष्टो मोहः। कष्टं शास्त्रम्।दुरवगाहमित्यर्थः। कषितमन्यत्। 'घुष् has घुष्ट in the sense of 'rubbed' or 'sounding'.

**Stanza 59—**

** रक्षस्पाशान्**

**.** पाशप् (पाश) is a स्वार्थवाचक affix, added to a Prâtipadika (crude form of a word) that expresses something censurable, The Sûtra "याप्येपाशप्" ५।३।४७॥means 'याप्ये वर्त्तमानात्प्रातिपदिकात्स्वार्थे पाशप् प्रत्ययो भवति। याप्यो वैयाकरणः कुत्सितो वैयाकरणो वैयाकरणपाशः। याज्ञिकपाशः। यो व्याकरणशाब्दे प्रवीणो दुःशीलस्तत्र कस्मान्न भवति। यस्य गुणस्य सद्भावाद् द्रव्ये शब्दनिवेशस्तत्कुत्सायां प्रत्ययः॥' काशि०. Thus वैयाकरणपाशः does not mean a proficient grammarian, who is ill-natured, but it means a contemptible grammarian, one whose knowledge of grammar is poor and meagre. As regards the gender of words to which स्वार्थवाचक affixes are added, they sometimes follow the gender of the प्रकृति and sometimes depart from it. On the Sûtra "विभाषा सुपो बहुच् पुरस्तात्तु "५।३।६८॥the Bhâshyakâra says:— 'इदं तर्हि प्रयोजनम् (that is तुग्रहणस्य)। प्रागुत्पत्तेर्यल्लिङ्गं वचनं च तदुत्पन्नेऽपि यथा स्यात्। बहुगुडो द्राक्षा। बहुतैलं प्रसन्ना। बहुपयो यवागूरिति। एतदपि नास्ति प्रयोजनम्। स्वार्थिकोऽयम्। स्वार्थिकाश्च प्रकृतितो लिङ्गवचनान्यनुवर्त्तन्ते। एवं तर्हि सिद्धे सति यत्तुग्रहणं करोति तज्ज्ञापयत्याचार्यः स्वार्थिका अतिवर्त्तन्ते अपि लिङ्गवचनानीति। किमेतस्य ज्ञापने प्रयोजनम्। गुडकल्पा द्राक्षा। तैलकल्पा प्रसन्ना। पयस्कल्पा यवागूरित्येतत्सिद्धं भवति॥'. We thus see that the gender of the whole word to which a स्वार्थवाचक affix is added is either that of the base to which the affix is added, as in बहुगुडो द्राक्षा, or is different from that of the base and is that of the word which is qualified by it, as in पयस्कल्पा यवागूः. रक्षस्पाश being a noun must be neuter. If the whole word does not follow the gender of the base रक्षस्, it must follow that of a word qualified by it, as in पयस्कल्पा यवागूः. There is none such here. रक्षस्पाश is itself a noun. It must then be neuter. The Mas. form isheld questionable by Malli, 'पयस्पाशम्' is used in the neuter in the Kâśikâand Kaumudîboth. 'स्वार्थिकाः प्रकृतितो लिङ्गवचनान्यतिवर्त्तन्ते' may, however, be taken in a general sense. There is a departure from the gender of the base. The word formed by



affixing a स्वार्थद्योतकtermination does not always follow the gender of प्रकृति (base). Jaya. explains it in the same way. He says: — 'रक्षस्पाशान् कुत्सितराक्षसान्। याप्ये पाशप्। स्वार्थिका अपि प्रकृतितो लिङ्गवचनान्यतिवर्त्तन्ते।'. We may also say:—पुल्लिङ्गं तु भवति लोकाश्रयत्वाल्लिङ्गस्थ.

Bharatamallika simply says:—'पुरुहूतेत्यत्र पृतनाषाडिति क्वचित्पाठः।' Malli's reading is पृतनाषाड्द्विषः. He notices पुरुहूतद्विषः also. He says just as तुरासाह् is used in Kumârasambhava 'तुरासाहं पुरोधाय धाम स्वायम्भुवं ययुः' २.१., so can पृतनासाह्be defended here. ण्विmay be affixed to सह्when preceded by an *Upapada* not only in the Vedic language, but also in classical Sanskrit. This he represents to be the view of some Commentators. His own view may be learnt from his Com. on 'तुरासाहं पुरोधाय &c’.

**.** 'उपसर्गात्सुनोतिसुवतिस्यतिस्तौतिस्तोभतिस्थासेनयसेधसिचसञ्जस्वञ्जाम्” ८।३।६५॥teaches that the स् of सु 5th Conj., सु 6th Conj., सो, स्तौ, स्तुभ्, स्था, सेनय, सिध्, सिच्, सञ्ज्, and स्वञ्ज् is changedto ष् when preceded by any vowel except अ or आ of an उपसर्ग. सद् has its स् changed to ष्when preceded by any vowel except अor आ of a preposition other than प्रति ("सदिरप्रतेः" ८।३।६६॥). स्तन्भ् changes its स् to ष्when preceded by any vowel except अ orआ of a preposition (“ स्तन्भेः" ८।३।६७॥). When preceded by अव स्तन्भ् changes its स् to ष् in the sense of ‘supporting', ‘being near' ("अवाच्चालम्बनाविदूर्ययोः" ८।३।६८॥). स्वन् preceded by विand अवchanges its स् to ष् in the sense of 'eating' ("वेश्चस्वनो भोजने" ८।३।६९॥). सेव्, सित, सय, सिव्, सह्, सुद् (the augmentस्prefixed to कृ), स्तु, and स्वञ्ज्, change their स् to ष्when preceded by परि, नि, and वि ("परिनिविभ्यः सेवसितसयसिवुसहसुट्स्तुस्वञ्जाम्" ८।३।७०॥). They change their स्to ष् optionally when the augment of the Imperfect or the Aorist comes between them and परि, नि or वि ("सिवादीनां वाड्व्यवायेऽपि" ८।३।७१॥). It is for this that स्तु and स्वञ्ज् are mentioned again in the Sûtra "परिनिविभ्यः—” even though they have already been mentioned in “उपसर्गात्सुनोति—" 'पूर्वेण सिद्धे स्तुस्वञ्जिग्रहणमुत्तरार्थम्। अङ्व्यवाये विभाषा यथा स्यात्.' The Sûtra which explains the form "अभिषिषिक्षन्तम्' will be now clear. It is "स्थादिष्वभ्यासेन चाभ्यासस्य" ८।३।६५॥. Roots beginning with स्था (mentioned in the Sûtra "उपसर्गात्सुनोति—" ६।३।६५॥) and upto and inclusive of सेव ('प्राक् सितात् ' *i.e.*before सित, meaning upto and inclusive of सेव, mentioned in the Sûtra "परिनिविभ्यः सेवसित—"८।३।७०॥) change their स् to ष्even when the reduplicative syllable comes between them and the vowel (other than अor आof course) of a preposition; and the स् of the reduplicative syllable of these roots alone & of no others is changed to ष्. 'अभ्यासस्येति वचनं नियमार्थं स्थादिष्वभ्याससकारस्य मूर्धन्यो भवति नान्यत्र। अभिसुसूरति। अभिसिषासति।' काशि०. सिच् coming between स्था and सित, changes its स् and the स् of its accordingly.

** अभिष्यन्तः**

**.** This must be taken with राक्षसाःunderstood. 'राक्षसाःक्रोधादात्मनोऽभिष्यन्तः अन्तं नयन्तः' Jaya.



**Stanza 74—**



**विष्यन्दमान^(०)**

_(.)स्यन्द् changes its स् to ष्optionally when preceded by अनु, वि, परि, अभि, and नि, provided a living being is not the agent of the action denoted by it. 'अप्राणिष्विति किम्। अनुस्यन्दते मत्स्य उदके। प्राण्यप्राणिविषयस्यापि स्यन्दतेरयं विकल्पो भवति। अनुष्यन्देते मत्स्योदके। अनुस्यन्देते। अप्राणिष्विति पर्युदासोऽयं न प्रसज्यप्रतिषेधः।' काशि०.



विष्कन्तॄन्

. स्कन्द् preceded by वि changes its स् to ष्optionally, in any form except that of the past participle. The past participle isविस्कन्नः. The root means 'to go'. 'स्कन्दिर् गतिशोषणयोः’। विविधं गन्तुं शीलमेषां ते विष्कन्तारः गमनशीलाश्चञ्चला अस्थिरप्रकृतयइत्यर्थः. When preceded by परि, स्कन्द् changes its स् to ष्optionally in all forms except in परिस्कन्दः. परिष्कण्णः or परिस्कन्नः, परिस्कन्दः.

**समर्थोऽपि.**

Because he was blessed by all Gods. The blessings are mentioned in the Râmâyaṇa:—

'ततस्त्रियुग्मस्त्रिककुत्रिधामा त्रिदशार्चितः।  
उवाच देवता ब्रह्मा मारुतप्रियकाम्यया॥

भो महेन्द्राग्निवरुणा महेश्वरधनेश्वराः।  
जानतामपि वः सर्वं वक्ष्यामि श्रूयतां हितम्॥

अनेन शिशुना कार्यं कर्त्तव्यं वो भविष्यति।  
तद्वदध्वं वरान् सर्वे मारुतस्यास्य तुष्टये॥ उत्तरका० ३६. ७-९.

 Then they all pronounce blessings upon him. Finally ब्रह्माsays:—

'दीर्घायुश्च महात्मा च ब्रह्मा तं प्राब्रवीद्वचः।  
सर्वेषां ब्रह्मदण्डानामवध्यत्वं भविष्यति॥' उत्तरका० ३६-२०.

**Stanza 78—**

 It must be noted that the स् ofसङ्गand स्थानis changed to ष् only when these words are compounded with अङ्गुलिand भीरुrespectively, not otherwise. In 'अङ्गुले सङ्गं पश्य' and 'भीरो स्थानं पश्य', it is not changed to ष्.

**Stanza 79—**



**ज्योतिष्टोम^(०)**

.स्तोम changes its स् to ष्when compounded with ज्योतिस् and आयुस् *e.g.*ज्योतिष्टोमः, आयुष्टोमः.



**Stanza 80—**



मातृष्वसेय्याः

. In the sense of अपत्य, छण्, (ईय) or ढक् is affixed to मातृष्वसृ and पितृष्वसृ. We have thus मातृष्वस्रीय (Fem. मातृष्वस्रीया) and पितृष्वस्रीय (Fem. पितृष्वस्रीया) or मातृष्वस्त्रेय ( Fem. मातृष्वस्रेयी) and पितृष्वस्रेय (Fem. पितृष्वस्रेयी).

 मातुःस्वसुः

. These may be taken either as two distinct words or as an अलुक् समास. In an अलुक् समास, स्वसृ changes its स् to ष्optionally when preceded by मातुः and पितुः. We have thus मातुःष्वसा or मातुःस्वसा; पितुःष्वसा or पितुःस्वसा. When this is not considered as अलुक् समास, but as two व्यस्त words, स् is not changed to ष्. 'असमासे तु मातुः स्वसा। पितुःस्वसा।'.

**Stanza 85—**



**ज्योतिष्टमाम्**

. स् preceded by a short vowel is changed to ष्when followed by a Taddhit affix beginning with त. These affixes are तर, तम, तय, त्व, तल् तस् and त्यप्. *e.g.* सर्पिष्टर, सर्पिष्टम, चतुष्टय, सर्पिष्ट्व, सर्पिष्टा, सर्पिष्ट, आविष्ट्यः. In गीस्तरा, धूस्तरा, and similar words, स् is not changed to ष् as the preceding vowel is long. The preceding word should not be a verbal form . 'तिङन्तस्य प्रतिषेधो वक्तव्यः। भिन्द्युस्तराम्।'.

**Stanza 89—**

 

**व्यतस्तम्भद्**

. The change of स् to ष् directed by the Sûtras "स्तम्भेः" ८।३।६७॥and "परिनिविभ्यः सेवसितसयसिवुसहसुद्स्तुस्वञ्जाम्” ८।३।७०॥ is prohibited by "स्तम्भुसिबुसहां चङि” ८।३।११६॥The स् of स्तम्भ्, सिव् and सह् is not changed to ष्in the 3rd Aorist. *e.g*. पर्यतस्तम्भत्, पर्यसीषिवत्, पर्यसीषहत. It should be noted that the स्following an उपसर्ग is not changed to ष् in these cases. The radical स् following the reduplicative syllable may be changed to ष्, if the rules allow it. 'स्तम्भुसिवुसहां चङि उपसर्गादिति वक्तव्यम्। उपसर्गाद्या प्राप्तिस्तस्याः प्रतिषेधो यथा स्यात्। अभ्यासाद्या प्राप्तिस्तस्यामा भूदिति।' काशि०

**Stanza 91—**



**विषसाद.**

The स् of सद् after the reduplicative syllable is not changed to ष्. The Sûtra "सदेः परस्य लिटि" prohibits the स् of सद् after अभ्यास from being changed to ष्. " सदिष्वञ्जोःपरस्य लिटि" ८।३।११८॥is the reading of the Sûtra in the Kâśikâ. Jaya. quotes the Sûtra in the same form, that is, as found in the Vṛiṭṭi. Bat this does not seem to



be the correct reading of the Sûtra . "सदेः परस्य लिटि” ८।३।११८॥ is the reading of Bha. Dî. in the Siddhântakaumudî. In the Mahâbhâshya also the Sûtra is found in the same form. "सदेः परस्य लिटि"॥ 'सदो लिटि प्रतिषेधे स्वञ्जेरुपसंख्यानं कर्त्तव्यम्। परिषस्वजे॥’महाभाष्य.

**अग्रेवणम्**.

Under the circumstances in which न् is changed to ण्, न् of वन् is changed to ण् only when preceded by पुरगा, मिश्रका,सिध्रका, शारिका, कोटरा, and अग्रे("वनं पुरगामिश्रकासिध्रकाशारिकाकोटराग्रेभ्यः" ८।४।१४॥)In कुबेरवनम्, असिपञ्चवनम्, शतधारवनम् &c. न् is not changed to ण्.

**Stanza 94 —**



**देवदारुवन॰**

. वन has its न् changed to ण् optionally when preceded by words denoting औषधि and वनस्पति. *e.g.* दूर्वावणम् or दूर्वावनम्, शिरीषवणम्or शिरीषवनम्, बदरीवणम् or बदरीवनम्. (विभाषौषधिवनस्पतिभ्यः" ८।४।६॥). A Vârtika to this Sûtra states that the words denoting औषधि and वनस्पतिmust consist of two or three letters, not more ('द्वयक्षरत्र्यक्षरेभ्य इति वक्तव्यम्'). Hence the न् of वन in देवदारुवनम् is not changed to ण् as देवदारु consists of four letters.

 

आम्रवणादिभिः.

The Sûtra for changing न् to ण् in आम्रवण is "प्रनिरन्तःशरेक्षुप्लक्षाम्रकार्ष्यखदिरपीयूक्षाभ्योऽसंज्ञायामपि" ८।४।५॥,which means thatवन changes its न्to ण् when preceded by प्र, निर्, अन्तर्, शर, इक्षु, प्लक्ष, आम्र, कार्ष्य, खदिर, and पीयूक्षा, when the whole word is a संज्ञा (Proper Noun) or not.

**रुधिरपायिणाम्**

. Jaya, says : - "रुधिरपायिणां राक्षसानाम्। पानं देशे इति णत्वम्।" न्, however, is not changed to ण् in रुधिरपायिणाम् by the Sûtra"पानं देशे" ८।४।९॥, which means that पान changes its न् to ण् when the whole word signifies a country, *e.g*. 'क्षीरपाणा उशीनराः। सुरापाणाः प्राच्याः। सौवीरपाणा बाह्लीकाः। कषायपाणा गान्धाराः', but by the Sûtra “प्रातिपदिकान्तनुम्विभक्तिषु च" ८।४।११॥,as it is here at the end of a प्रातिपदिक.

**Stanza 105 —**

 

प्रकोपण

and

प्रगोपण.

The न् belonging to a कृत् affix (अन मान अनीय अनि इनि निष्ठा एते णत्वं प्रयोजयन्ति) added to a root beginning with a consonant and having any vowel except अor आas its penultimate, is optionally changed to ण् when the कृदन्त comes after a preposition



containing र् under the circumstances in which न् is generally changed to ण्. Thus प्रकोपण and प्रकोपन, प्रगोपण and प्रगोपणare all correct readings.

**Stanza 106—**



**प्रेङ्खण.**

If न्belonging to a कृत् affix added to a root having नुम् or Anuswâra in it ('नुम्ग्रहणमनुस्वारोपलक्षणार्थम्। अट्कुप्वाङिति सूत्रेऽप्येवम्।तेनेह न प्रेन्वनम्। इह तु स्यादेव प्रोम्भणम्।' सिद्धा० कौ०) is changed to ण् when the कृदन्त comes after a preposition containing र् under circumstances in which न् is generally changed to ण्, it is changed to ण् only in the case of roots which begin with any vowel except अor आand end in a consonant. "इजादेःसनुमः" ८।४।३२॥
'सिद्धे सत्यारम्भो नियमार्थ इजादेरेव सनुमो नान्यस्मादिति। प्रमङ्गनम्। परिमङ्गनम्। हल इत्यधिकाराण्ण्यन्ते नित्यं विध्यर्थमेतन्नभवति।' काशि०. The reading प्रेङ्खनः adopted by B. is incorrect.

**Stanza 107—**

** प्रगमनम्**

. न् of a कृत् affix added to भा, भू, पू (to purify); कम्, गम्, प्याय्, and वेप्is not changed to ण् under circumstances in which न् is generally changed to ण्. "न भाभूपूकमिगमिप्यायिवेपाम्" ८।४।३४॥.'कृत्यचः’ इति प्राप्तः प्रतिषिध्यते। ..... अत्र भौवादिकस्य पूञोग्रहणं द्रष्टव्यम्। पूङ् प्रतिषेधे इत्यस्य मा भूत्। प्रपवणं सोमस्य।' काशि०ः

**Stanza 122—**



**मुखमस्तीत्यभाषिष्ठाः**

. With the reading adopted in the text, the object of अभाषिष्ठाःmust be supplied from the context. Jaya says:— 'अतो मुखमस्तीत्यभाषिष्ठाः अभिहितवानसि’, "सीतां प्रत्यर्पयन् धर्ममाप्नुहि" इति। "You tell me to achieve merit by returning Sîtâ; because you have a mouth, which is a means for speaking whatever one likes. You have not said so after proper thought." With Malli.'s reading ‘रामे साशङ्कतां मयि,’ साशङ्कताम् is the object of अभाषिष्ठाः. In this case we have not to supply the object. This is no doubt a better reading, but is not supported by a majority of Mss. The meaning is “When you advise me to return Sîtâ, you speak of fear in my case with regard to Râma, simply because you have amonth, that is, without proper deliberation.'

**Stanza 124—**

 Most of the Mss. read विरोधः, विराधः is no doubt better reading, as even when we read विरोधः, विराधः is to be supplied, as going



with एकः. Both Malli and Jaya. read विराधःJaya. explains अविवक्षितः as 'शौर्यान्न प्रतीतः' and Bharatamallika as 'अप्रसिद्धः शैौर्येणाप्रतीतोवा.' Malli explains it as असंजातविवक्षः. विवक्षा सञ्जाता अस्येति विवक्षितः "तदस्य सञ्जातं तारकादिभ्य इतच्" ५।२।३६॥इतीतच्. Thus he takes अविवक्षित in the sense of 'one in whom desire is not produced that the opponent is my prey (अयं मे वध्यः)'.

**Stanza 135—**  
 **नमतः संध्याम्.**

The Stanza alludes to the story of Râvana desiring to fightVâlî. It is said that after Râvaṇawas released by Sahasrârjuna, he again became proud of his powers. Once he went to Kishkindhâ and called out Vâlî to fight with him. Vâlî was not there, so Sugrîva and other monkeys not being themselves able to measure their strength with him, told him to wait till Vâlî returned from Sandhyâ-adoration on all the four oceans. 'चतुर्भ्योऽपि समुद्रेभ्यः संध्यामन्वास्य रावण। इदं मुहूर्त्तमायाति वाली तिष्ठ मुहूर्त्तकम्॥’ If he was anxious, however, to be killed by him very soon, he would find him performing Sandhyâ-adoration on the Southern ocean. 'अथवा त्वरसे मर्त्तुं गच्छ दक्षिणसागरम्। वालिनं द्रक्ष्यसे तत्र भूमिष्ठमिव पावकम्॥'. Itching to fight with Vâlî, Râvaṇa ascended Pushpaka and went to the Southern ocean. He there found Vâlî performing adoration, and thought of catching him from behind unawares. Vâlî saw him and understood his intention, but he did not fear him at all as a lion would not fear a hare approaching him. Then

'हस्तग्राहं तु तं मत्वा पादशब्देन रावणम्।  
पराङ्मुखोऽपि जग्राह वाली सर्पमिवाण्डजः॥  
ग्रहीतुकामं तं गृह्य रक्षसामीश्वरं हरिः।  
खमुत्पपात वेगेन कृत्वा कक्षावलम्बिनम्॥'.

 Placing him thus within his arm-pit, Vâlî went successively to the Western, Northern, and Eastern oceans and having performed Sandhyâadoration on each of these oceans, he returned to Kishkindhâ and having released him from his arm-pit asked him who he was.

'रावणं तु मुमोचाथ स्वकक्षात्कपिसत्तमः।  
कुतस्त्वमिति चोवाच प्रहसन् रावणं मुहुः॥  
विस्मयं तु महद्गत्वा श्रमलोलनिरीक्षणः।  
राक्षसेन्द्रो हरीन्द्रं तमिदं वचनमब्रवीत्॥



वानरेन्द्र महेन्द्राभ राक्षसेन्द्रोऽस्मि रावणः।  
युद्धेप्सुरिह संप्राप्तः स चाद्यासादितस्त्वया॥  
अहो बलमहो वीर्यमहो गाम्भीर्यमेव च।  
येनाहं पशुवद्गृह्य भ्रामितश्चतुरोऽर्णवान्॥'

 Then a firm friendship was formed between them both and sanctified in the presence of fire.
