**Life of Srimad Vedanta Desikar.**  
<MISSING_FIG href="../books_images/U-IMG-1722182792Screenshot2024-07-28213620.png"/>

  The author of this work is Sri Venkatanatha Acharya, popularly known as Srimad Vedanta Desika, the greatest poet, dramatist, philosopher and guide of millions of souls, from the torment of rebirth to luminous liberation, *Mokshâ*, and to the enjoyment of the Suddha Satwic Kalyana Gunas (qualities) and whose countenance beamed with resplendent brightness. He was born at Conjeevaram,South India, in a place known as “Tirutthangavei” or the blessed “Hima Upavanam,” near the temple of Dipa Prakasaka Swami. His birth was caused in the following circumstances.

  There was a great sage, Anantha Suri Somayaji, who married one Thotharamba and was spending his days in contented retirement, attending daily to the service of Bhagavan and the sacrificial fire. In their dreams, God Venkateswara, or the Lord of the Seven Hills at Tirupati, appeared to them and directed them to go on a pilgrimage to Tirupati where He would bless them with a son. Tirupati is one of the eight sacred places looked upon by all classes of Hindus with utmost reverence and love. The Puranas have unanimously declared that the great God Narayana after leaving Vaikunta came and settled down with His spouse Lakshmi near the tank at “Swami Pushkarini”. It is even affirmed with great authority that Tirupati is the only place where even sinners are brought to repentance and saved in this Kali Yuga. Lord Venkateswara, it said, gave to Emperor Thondaman His disc and conch. The great Ramanujacharya did Him a service by giving back to Him the disc and conch and reinstating Him in his former splendour.

In return, the great God now desired this, that His doctrines should be improved and placed on a firmer basis. It was with that view that the Lord directed the couple to go to Tirupati.

  They related their dream to their well-wishers and on their advice started out towards Tirupati and reaching the temple on the hills worshipped Sri Venkateswara. In Thotbaramba's sleep she dreamt that the Lord appeared unto her as a boy and gave her the huge bell telling her that that would be her son. In the morning the bell was found missing and the temple authorities began to punish the servants. The couple related the dream to the public and the great sage of the hills said that he had had a dream to the same effect. The *Archaka* got inspired, and he revealed the intentions of God as being of like effect. Then the couple, with their faces beaming with joy, returned to Conjeevaram. For 12 years the wife was pregnant and on Wednesday the 10th, the bright night of the month of Bhadrapada in the year Sukla (4371 of the Kaliyuga) she gave birth to a son. As he was born on the 10th day of the festival of the Lord of the Seven Hills, he was named after Him as Venkatanath.

  After one year the child was taken to the temple of Varadarajaswami at Conjeevaram and there the God declared that he would live to excel the great Ramanuja. As he was born in the family of the sage Viswamitra, he was called by the elders, “Thoopul Pillai, or the boy of the sacred grass, or Visvamitram”. When five years old, he was taken by his maternal uncle Appillar to hear the Theosophical lectures delivered by the then leader Nadadhurammal, where, struck with the aura of the boy

and reminded of the missing of the temple bell on the Hills and of the blessings of Varadarajaswami, all began to look at him with pleasure and in so doing forgot the place of their discourse. Ammal himself was unable to fix the place with precision : so much was he absorbed in thinking of the future greatness of the boy when, to their delight, this boy of 5 years pointed out to them the place where they had left off and even repeated the previous lectures with such exactness that Ammal, with tears of joy, embraced him and stroked his head and blessed him as Pulastya Bhagavan did in the case of Parashara Maharshi. Thenceforth he was instructed with great care in all that would make him useful to the world as a spiritual leader. While studying the Vedas he exhibited such an uncommon memory and excellent understanding and had such a great grasp of ideas that his teacher was in rapture at the thought of his future greatness. Thus he was able to dive into the depths of the Vedas, the mysteries of the Upanishads, Puranas and Itihasas, to excel others in ordinary Shastras, and to follow the footpaths of the learned Acharyas in unravelling the esoteric meanings of spiritual wisdom.

  Before he was twenty he became a perfect master of all kinds of education. Seeing him already a great saint, several elders accepted him as their spiritual guide. As Desika wanted to have a perfect command over everything, he started towards Cuddalore to pay his respects to Vainateya and to God Hayagriva. On his way he stopped at the temple of Madurantakam where Ramanuja was initiated into the mysteries of spiritual knowledge. At Cuddalore on the medicinal hill-top of Aushadhadri

worshipped the man-lion God and sitting underneath a pepul tree he concentrated his mind on Vainateya, the embodiment of the Vedas. Vainateya appeared unto him and instructed him to concentrate his mind on Sri Hayagriva, (Horsebead God). Venkatanath did not, like others, pray to God with a selfish object in view. He simply prayed to God, as that would please Him most. The great Lord appeared unto him and gave him the *Amritam* foam which gushed from his mouth. That draught infused Desika with such divine splendour so that his face shone with the utmost brilliancy. All Vidyas assumed forms and waited upon the Guru as they once did upon Sri Ramachandra when He received instructions from the sage Visvamitra. He was ordained by Hayagriva as the improver of the Ramanuja-siddhanta and nothing but truth would emanate from his lips just as it came from Valmiki's lips when he composed the Ramayana. Thus blessed by the Lord he composed nine *prabandhams* in honor of the God at Cuddalore. He returned to Conjeevaram, where, to his joy, his Acharya's wife gave birth to a son whom he named Srinivasa. The good news was communicated to the father Appillar who was the Acharya of the king Sri Krishna Deva Raja. That very day Appillar was directed in his dream to hand over his tutelary God Hayagriva to Desika. Communicating this to the king and with his consent he sent the God with a great retinue to Conjeevaram. Desika accepted the God and displayed his love towards Him by composing a sthothram in his praise. He afterwards went to the Tirupati Hills and worshipped Venkateswara, who directed him to compose a worthy sthothram in his

honor. Desika composed one called *Dáyásatakam* of 100 slokas which is an elaborate commentary on saranagathi mantra sara. On his way to Benares he stopped at a town on the banks of the Tungabhadra. Here he met his old class-mate Vidyaranya, the great commentator on the Vedas and Brahma-sutras and the next greatest in Adwaita Philosophy to Sankaracharya. The Raja's daughter was possessed by a Brahma Rakshasa and the Raja finding such a worthy couple in his town, requested their aid. Desika did not consent, but proceeded to Ayodhya, Srikurmam and other sacred places and worshipping the Gods, bathed in the sacred river Bhagirathi and returned to Southern India. He visited Ahobilam, Trivallore, Tinnanore, Triplicane and Sriperumbudur and finally came to Sri Rangam. Here he came in contact with a great Advaitic philosopher who being unable to defeat Desika by arguments had recourse to black magic. He dived into a pond and caused Desika's stomach to swell, with the water which the pond contained. Guessing the cause Desika made a hole in the pillar and water began to gush out. Thus was the magician brought to his senses and he went away wondering at the greatness of his adversary. At this time Desika received a letter from his friend Vidyaranya who, on expelling the Rakshasa, was very influential with the king. The letter expressed the sorrow he felt for Desika's indigence and requested him to go there where he would be well provided for by the king. Desika was very sorry to see that his friend should become attached to worldly comforts and thus be retarded in his spiritual evolution.

   So he replied that a human being who is contented need not go and cringe to a king for his real necessities. As for riches, he had plenty of them in Varadarajaswami on the Hastisaila at Conjeevaram. Vidyaranya was astonished to behold the meekness of his friend. But at the instigation of the enemies of Desika, a poor Brahmin boy was instructed to go and beg of Desika for riches. The boy came to Desika and wanted his help. Desika took him to the temple of Lakshmi (Perundevi) and prayed to that Goddess when to the confusion and shame of his enemies heaps of gold fell in showers and the boy went away showing the riches he had to the public and extolling Desika. At this time Desika's wife gave birth to a worthy son Varadacharya. He excelled his father in his meekness and sanctity and all elders began to love him as they loved his father. Desika now began to compose many works, the chief of which are: (1) A collection of esoteric secrets; (2) commentaries on Ramanuja's commentary and Yamuna's abstract on Bhagavad Gita; (3) a commentary on Sri Bhashya; (4) notes on Ishavasyopanishad; and (5) a work pointing out defect of other religions and answers to their attacks on Visistadvaita.

  As Nammalwar had already rendered a Tamil version of the essence of Samaveda into 1000 stanzas and as Tamil was very difficult to understand, he composed 100 stanzas in Sanskrit, each stanza embodying the gist of 10 stanzas. As Yamunacharya has composed a sthothram in praise of the Kalyana Gunas of Narayana, Desika made a great commentary on the same, known as “Sthothra Bhashyam.” He went to Srirangam and in

one hour composed 1000 slokas (Paduka sahasram) in honor of the sandals of Ranganatha. Ranganatha was so very pleased with the beauty and diction of the sthothram that he styled him “Sarva Thantra Svathantra” and “Kavitharkika Simham.” Once upon a time Vidyaranya, the representative of Advaitic Philosophy, and Akshobhya Tirtha, that of Madhva Philosophy, were engaged in vehement discussions on the Kalyana Gunas of Narayana and the matter was referred to the final decision of Venkatanath. Venkatanath pronounced that Vidyaranya, the vast forest of Vidyas, was cleared away by Akshobhya, the great sword in the discussion. *Asina Thatwamasina Paratathwa Prabhedhina*. He afterwards went to Trinagiri, the birthplace of the great Nammalwar, then reached Yadhugiri and having worshipped the God, came to Srirangam where he spent his closing period in attending to the spiritual welfare of his people.

  Thus by his simple living and saintly habits and austere devotion towards Ranganatha, he showed to the world that a Grihasta with all his family ties can attain *Moksha* without becoming a Sanyasin or renouncing the world and one's responsibilities to it. As a poet Desika is beyond comparison. He wrote three works: (1) Yadava Abhyudayam; (2) Sankalpa Suryodayam; (3) Hamsa Sandesam, besides 6 Kavyams which all excel those of the great Kalidasa, the renowned, dramatist. He composed all 32 sthothrams, 8 Kavyams, 24 discourses on the Sastric principles, 32 secret doctrines, 24 prabandhams, and a big book, Nigama Parimalam, treating of Narayana and His Sattvic Kalyana qualities. He lived

for more than 100 years and then with great calmness of mind received permission from God to give up his life and reach Sri Vaikunta. Before his death he summoned all his disciples, advised them to lead a simple and virtuous life full of true devotion towards Narayana, and to be guided by his high-minded son Varadacharya whom be directed to lead a celibate life as he was not sure that his descendants would preserve the sanctity of the race. Thus passed away this magnanimous soul after striving its best to help the world and leaving behind it a name never to be effaced from the annals of spiritual records.

**<MISSING_FIG href="../books_images/U-IMG-1722274759Screenshot2024-07-29230850.png"/>**  
**CANTO I.**

  1. I salute that Luminary (Vasudeva) who wanders in Brindavana, who is dear to all shepherdesses, who was born on the day of Jayanti and who has Vijayanti as his ornament.

  2. Even the Vedas have exhausted themselves before they could describe in full each of His qualities. Is it necessary to say that others less skilled are utterly unable to describe such a person fully?

  3. It is but meet that even those who are of obtuse intelligence drink as much as they could of the (sweet) story of the son of Vasudeva. Will not men drink nectar if they can obtain it?

  4. They are thoroughly dead to all shame, who pass for poets even when they are remembering (the name of) that great man who took his birth in the ant-hill, and also Vyasa.

  5. Only such a composer is called a poet, from whom, words whose style is suitable to meaning and

which are filled with *rasas*, *bhavas*, *vyángyas*, and figures of speech flow with great ease.

  The secondary meaning is this :—‘Only such a creator is said to be all-knowing. in whom Saraswati with her ornaments giving brighter lights to the expressions of love, takes delight.

  6. Every book is new at the time of its production ; but after a time It becomes old. Therefore, neither the one (its being new) nor the other (its being old) can render the book good or bad.

  7. Just as those who understand the secrets of various kinds of dances do not disgrace her who is so much absorbed in performing the Marga dance as to forget all sorrow, though she goes wrong somewhere, so the devotees of God will not find fault with my words proceeding in a sinless direction though it may go wrong somewhere.

  8. Therefore I narrate without trepidation the birth of the son of
Vasudeva, which is the life-restoring medicine to wise men and gods and which is the nectar of the ocean of the Veda of Vyasa.

  9. The supreme Ruler, constantly attended with Lakshmi, produced this picture of Universe, alone and voluntarily, with the brush of sport smeared with mercy.

  10. The moon, the delighter of worlds, who is like the embodiment of favour upon all those who deserve protection, took his birth from the heart of Him (the supreme Lord).

  11. Pururavas, of auspicious fame, who was born to his (the Moon's) son, proved that virtuous men who consecrated the sacred fire would enjoy the heavenly bliss.

  12. That race, by the pearls of whose fame the ten directions were adorned, grew more and more by descendants, as a bamboo grows by knots.

  13. In that race was Nahusha born, like Airavata in the ocean, whom the gods when they lost Indra, appointed to his place.

  14. The great kings in the realms of this earth, being adorned with the symbol of his name, were like moving triumphal ports to honour that brave man.

  15. His unsurpassed power was liked even by his enemies; as is the cool argument of a speaker, stating all facts (in its favour), by his antagonists.

  16. Just as *Veera rasa* takes its origin from a feeling called *Uthsaha*, so the brave Yayati who occupied half the seat of Indra, took his birth from Nahusha.

  17. The goddess of the earth took half the seat, along with the goddess of warriors, on the top (protection) of his arm, which was wide, stout and high.

  18. The kings were not able to transgress his command involving the fulfilment of his business and that of others, as antagonists cannot object to an authority quoted by the speaker, supporting his views and tape of the antagonists.

  19. As men afflicted with the heat of the sun (resort to) a tank, as gods (worshipped) the Indra, and as Bhavas which are fit, (developed) a *rasa*, so was he worshipped by the kings.

  20. Of him was born the famous Yadu, with whose descendants, who had no equals, equality was obtained only in pictures.

  21. To those who applied for charity, he replied by (presenting) the sweet-tongued bees sitting upon the lotus of Lakshmi.

  22. He did not respect the learning of one devoid of good conduct. The light of the moon on the day of. Chaturthi should not be enjoyed simply because it is clear.

  23. The first beggars of him, who was not to be requested a second time, and who gave more than he was asked, satisfied those that came last.

  24. Neither the peace made by that mighty (king) with his enemies nor the fixing of arrows ever took place twice, (having failed once) in its object.

  25. The inhabitants of heaven considered him a clever ruler of the world, whose punishments were just, who put an end to his enemies, and who acted impartially towards all.

  26. The tree of the race ef Yadu, fragrant with the flowers of fame, was with its many branches on the

surface of this earth, for the delight of gods and wise men.

  27. In his race was born Vasudeva, the lord of the earth, who had been in his former birth the father of the (two) sects of gods and demons;

  28. Who was called by the name of Anakadundubhi, as he was born with the noise of Anaka and Dundubhi in heaven.

  29. The Rajoguna and Thamoguna being removed, (from the earth) by him, who possessed pure Sathwa guna, the earth shone as if her swoon having ended, she recovered her breath.

  30. As Vishnu was the chief abode of all the worlds, the Sun of all splendour, and the ocean of all precious stones, so was the king, of (all) virtuous men.

  31. The famous-gloried wives of him who formerly a Prajapati, were born as Devaki and Rohini in human form.

  32. Just as the Ganga and with great Yamuna, flowing with great speed, unite with each other, (mix with the waters of the ocean), and have their nature water of the same natureas that of the ocean, so his two wives, who hadliberal views, and who loved each other, had the sameamount of love for their husband.

  33. He, uniting them, who were fit to him, felt himself very happy; and by this union became the cause of themanifestation ofthe Vishnu with his bed(Adisesha.)

  34. He with his face turned away from Artha and the kama, did not desire toobtain the emperorship; but he enjoyed such dominionas he could obtain by chance,which he courted, as it enabled him to free himself from the debts (to gods and forefathers).

  35. Kamsa, having accepted his fate in future, as announced by a voice from heaven, put Devaki and Vasudeva in jail.

  36. That Kalanemi, who was stronger than Yama (himself) was born in the course of time as Kamsa, who appeared to possess in himself the spirit of all the Asuras.

  37. In the meantime, the goddess who had the ocean for her girdle, spoke to the gods with Brahma at their head, who dwelt in the centre of the Meru.

  38. The fact that a great burden is put upon the virtuous men by the omnipresent Vishnu, is known, Oh gods, to you.

  39. “I am now occupied by numberless, strange, high mountains of Rakshasas, yielding to evil, and breaking down the mound of *virtue*.

  40. “Let the gods, who think of the welfare of the world, so act that I neither fall nor break myself up.”

  41. The inhabitants of heaven being thus made. known of the facts, by the bearer of animals, understood that to remove the burden was possible only to her husband.

  42. Putting the mother of the world in their front, and quicker than the mind (itself), they went to a distance and praised the God resting on the milky ocean.

  43. “We bow to thee, who shinest in the centre of the three Vedas, who hast three habitations, who hast five weapons, who givest gifts, and who receivest offerings both external and internal.

  44.“Thou, whose glory is dependendent upon others, on whom others” glory is dependent and whose actions are determined by Thy mercy, protect us who bow to Thee.

  45. “Thou, the famous ocean of mercy, shining with clusters of precious stones of (good qualities), keepest up thy appearance in all Avatharas with their (corresponding) attendants, even as the ocean rises and falls.

  46. “Who can measure Thee who canst not be understood by the Vedas (themselves) which were manifested by Thee alone in the beginning (of each Kalpa) and which do not refer to any other than Thee.

  47. “The journey in which sunset was the resting place, for the travellers, namely, the Vedas, who wanted to reach the other shore of Thy immeasurable glory.

  48. “Of what nature is Thy sport, who, deserving to be saluted, yet bows to mean persons, who bestowing gifts to others, yet begs of them, and who, hast our sons as fathers, nobody can describe.

  49. “Thou, who sportest like an actor, with a variety of forms (assumed) of different natures, swellest the surprise of men who think of none but Thee,

  50. “Thy mere sport is water to the roots of *Karma* with wonderful sprouts (of all living things) from Brahmam to grass.

  51. “The qualities of Thee, whose firm existence (in the world) is without support, who art the natural Lord (of all) and who rules (over all) without help (from others), are high and unique.”

  52. “Thou, who shinest like Chintamani, within the hearts of the pure-minded, and whose brightness cannot be hidden, givest (them) what is desired (of thee.)

  53. “Bathing in the nectar-river of devotion (to Thee), is advised to a living being, tired(by travel) in the impassable desert of Samsara.

  54. “Thou, possessing all the qualities, art the great boat that helps one who turns round and round in the whirlpool of the ocean of sin, and who feels (consequently) miserable.

  55.“Thyself art the example of Thee, who art immeasurable by time, place and other things; anything other than Thee is (only) a negative instance of Thee.

  56.“A small portion of Thy power with Thy Will as its minister is able to create or destroy the world or to do nothing, as the times need.

  57. “Thou art the objective of the performances of *yoga*, who hast *Lakshmi* and *Kaustubha* as Thy distinctive marks, Who as we read (in the Vedas), art causeless, and Who art the origin of all.

  58. “Thy favour is the long-lived guarantee even in times of the destruction of universe, to those who try to obtain either the collection of the three (Dharma, Artha, and Kama) or *Moksha*.

  59. “Thou art that *single letter*, which is (a form of) Brahmam which is connected with all the Vedas, which is the Saviour of all beings, and which means Thee.

  60. “No support is given to the sinking sin of the virtuous, whose hands are held by Thee, and who are coming out of the water.

  61. “These, playing the part of a Chataka, with their helpless thoughts, stick to thee for support, who observest a vow to protect the helpless.

  62. “Thou, the never-setting sun, causest to those who have been sleeping from time immemorial, such wakefulness that they never again sleep.

  63. “Thou, the animater of fugitives, remove quickly our distress, who have taken refuge with Thee, as the sun removes darkness.

  64. “Asuras are born for the trouble of the world, the anti-suns in spite of the existence of the sun; (Oh God) destroy them with Thy power.”

  65. Being thus praised by the gods who desired the destruction of the Asuras, He (though) invisible, kindly became visible to them.

  66. Then the gods saw Him sitting upon the bed of Sesha, like a strange cloud sitting upon a cloud in autumn.

  67. Whose abundance of wealth was indicated by Lakshmi, who sitting beside (Him) marked by the sign of a lotus, and who took her body voluntarily.

  68. Who was adorned with ornaments, which were delicate, happy to the touch, and good-smelling, and which appeared like the flowers of the garden of his bodily virtues.

  69. Whose ornaments were made unimportant by His limbs, pleasing the world's eyes, adorning each other, and possessing an immeasurable amount of beauty.

  70, Whose spirit of victory was highly animated by weapons, Whose aim was not (fruitless), and which were as it were his natural qualities such as strength, exploit, cleverness and other ones.

  71. Who had his self-formed body within the ocean of beauty, whose glory caused wonder, who was like a newly formed sapphire.

  72. Who was given a desire for war by his vehicles, an incarnation of the Vedas, shining with the bracelet of a serpent, and ancinted with the smell of his feet.

  73. Who was promising with the eyebrow-signs, that which was made known to (Him) by the devotion-bent commander, by the shaking of whose cane, that those that were to be led to Vishnu were (made) motionless.

  74. The dwellers in heaven considered him to be the never-setting sun, the never-waning Moon, and the shoreless ocean of nectar.

  75. The gods on seeing the (supreme) Lord, the end of whose hand was marked by (the position of) protection from fear, and whose welcoming smile destroyed all sin, obtained the desire of their eyes.

  76. The possessors of heaven respectfully communicated the cause of his coming (to the earth) once more, (to the Lord) by whom all Asuras were killed, and who (therefore) knew the fact (as well as they knew).

  77. “Those Danavas who played the part of locusts in Thy heroic-lustre, being born as these Kshatriyas, agitate this earth.

  78. “This (earth), living on which is the source of the four objects of human life, and which produces offerings to gods as well as Pitris, breaks itself on account of the burden of the Asuras.

  79. “(As) this earth was born of thy lotus-like foot which isa pillow to the heads of the Vedas, the protection of it is solely dependent on Thee.

  80. “The big waved oceans will wash away the earth, if Thou dest not hasten to remove its burden.

  81. “Let not this earth, which has Thee whose mind is full of mercy, for its sailor, be drooping like a big ship in water.

  82. “The trouble from Asuras having been put an end to by Thee, the gem of the girdle (of the earth), it deserves to be adorned.

  83. Let the earth, being cleared of Kamsa and other thorns, be for a long time a crest of Thee in the form of Sesha.

  84.“Bathe us by Thy glances, the waves of the chief ocean of mercy, which are smiling, clear, cool, and pleasant to look at from wakefulness.

  85. “We hope Thou wilt forgive the fraud of us who have placed our burdens over thee, in (thus) requesting thee who knowest all things worth knowing.

  86. When the assembly of gods said thus, the Earth with Brahma bowed to the Lord who observed a vow to protect the obedient.

  87. The Earth, which took the form of the best female with thin waist, wide eyes, slender body and profuse breasts, and which (consequently) appeared like the great Maya.

  88. Who by the bees, attracted by the smell of the forelocks, and arranged in a circular form, had the perfection of an umbrella of peacock feathers, got without effort.

  89. Who, with her breasts adorned by the drops of tears caused by the joy of seeing (her) lover, which looked like pearls set therein.

  90. (The earth) who was also clever highly esteemed her left arm, which throbbed and which (as it were) desired to embrace only her husband.

  91. And she, with her voice, sweet as the tone of *Veena*, and with her corals of lips where pearls were mixed with coy smile, told of the danger (to him).

  92. Then the deity replied to them in auspicious words, which were applauded by the re-sounding conch.

  93. “You who have taken refuge with me need not be afraid of the army of *Asuras*. To him who never trangresses my command, disgrace will never happen.

  94. “Oh gods, my incarnation shall remove the burden from the earth, and establish the eternal virtue, uninjured.

  95. “Maintain your (respective) positions, with your dangers gone, receiving all offerings, and exercising your authority to its fullest extent.

  96. “Oh lords of the gods, you will see the earth which will become light by destroying the kings of Asuras, as if it were cured of a disease.

  97.“You must also be born on the earth as lords of kings who share in the delight of hunting the crowd of the animals of Asuras”

  98. Then Vishnu, whose command was never vain, having thus ordered the gods, fixed His mind upɔn Madura, rejecting the milky ocean.

  99. The husband of Lakshmi, having consoled by the showers of the nectar of His speech the gods and the goddesses of the earth bent by the burden of *Asuras*, and desiring to be born of the wife of Vasudeva, thought of the occasions for (showing his) mercy.

  100. Desiring to make the position of the virtuous, (secure) and (to keep) the virtues uninjured, He who deserves to be bowed to by (even) the god of gods, and in whose belly the whole world exists, was born a child in the womb of Devaki.

**CANTO II.**

  1. Then, the queen shone with the sign of pregnancy, which was (a source) of unalloyed greatness to the Vedas which was (a source) of great gain of wealth to virtue, and which showed (their former) greatness to the dwellers in heaven.

  2. The signs of pregnancy of her, who bore in her womb the source of the three worlds, whose shape was diversified by *Sringara rasa, Veera rasa and Adbhuta rasa,* were of two kinds, being variegated by sports high and low.

  3. She certainly, without any effort, became superhuman by a certain elixir (namely) Sri Krishna, whose

greatness is explained by all the Vedas, which was famous (ever living) and which had been used by those who have been cured (waited upon by the Siddhas).

  4. She who, with the lustre of her (body) which is excellent as a gold image, obtained in course of time the splendour of silver by (taking in) the elixir famous in the Vedas.

  5. The splendour of her (body), white in its lower part, and blue in (its) upper part by the rays of in-lying Vishnu, (which were) shining like the peacock feather, was like the welfare-giving row of the sprouts of precious stones.

  6. The beauty of the cheeks of Vasudeva's wife,which were shininglike the moon and which appeared like the splendour, departed, of her seventh conception, gradually developed, shone in course of time as if it were smeared with camphor.

  7. The colour of the limbs of the honey oozing-limbed (Devaki) which was like the pure *Satwa* quality directed by the in-lying (Vishnu), the foremost of men, shone like the fresh flow of nectar.

  8. She, with the rays of her (body) mingled a little with the splendour proceeding from the in-lying Vishnu, was like the source of the sprouts of precious stones, for the welfare of the people.

  9. Her side-long looks, appearing as handsome as the agitated ocean of milk, prepared a peculiar white wash

of colour useful in plastering the palace of the three worlds.

  10. The famous Devaki, who used to look into the minds of the Rakshasas and Danavas placed (there) by Kamsa in the act of guarding the jail, being (only) once looked at (by them) agitated their minds.

  11. The lustre of her nipples was, as it were, deeply anointed by the splendour of the child in (her) womb, which, i.e., the splendour, was like the shining of a cloud to the growth of crops of joy of those who plough the field of Yoga.

  12. She, certainly indicating that the ruler of the universe who formerly ruled over this earth had entered her womb, showed certain signs.

  13. The brightness of the gem of (her) nipple, which was as agreeable as that of musk, and which was, as it were, the anointing of collyrium to the possessors of inward glance, anxious to see the child in the womb, was beautiful.

  14. The pure-hearted looked upon her, who was about to manifest Him, the creator of high as well as low, as the store of learning and the grand-mother of the universe.

  15. The all-knowing Devaki wrote fittingly all the worlds on the painting cloth brought with sport; which certainly became the original to creators in their duties.

  16. The holy-hearted queen who followed the way of the desireless, and who adopted the policy of attaining Moksha desired to make the growth of Kritayuga.

  17. The queen, being asked by her friend—which do you want of those you have not yet obtained and which do you want now of those you have already tasted?—said in reply only ‘nothing.’

  18. She being secretly told (by her friends)...“Oh merciless queen, how is it that your kindness to friends is not afflicted?”—replied (them only) by her pleasant looks.

  19. She very often lay down without getting sleep. She made her steps as if she wanted to measure (the ground). She refusing (to think of) the worlds, and meditating upon the actions of God, sat upon a comfortable seat.

  20, She with her peculiar mode of walking, looking, speaking, etc.,intelligible only to those who were quite familiar to her, was suspected by the people, to be proud, or to be drowsy from intoxication or overcome by exhaustion.

  21. She, with sleepy eyes, beheld her own form, lying upon Sesha, riding upon Garuda, sitting upon a lotus as if on a platform of precious stones, and being praised by the Kimpurushas.

  22. She, containing within her that mighty being in Whom the whole universe lies, saw the universe within

herself. Such a marvel is beyond our powers of reasoning.

  23. Close by her she saw Vishwaksena with the extremity of his gold cane broken to pieces by beating on the crests of the chiefs of the gods and demons, disclosing his joy, but invisible to others.

  24. With words enlivening the three Vedas, which are the store-house of the welfare of the three worlds, she, the absolutely blessed one, called by their names the Devas who were fit to be commanded.

  25. Whatever the lawful wife of Yadava said by chance about the virtuous, high and low,—to this even the sayings, of which neither the beginning nor the end was found, were certainly (mere) echoes.

  26. She desired to undertake the business of protecting the universe. She showed mercy even to him who was guilty. She, being noisy desired to say the *Mantrams* useful for (the attainment of) Moksha.

  27. When Narayana, the giver of the fruit of the four objects of human life to Sadhus entered her womb, she, stooping (with the weight of her body) attained the full height of nobility and desired that she alone should bestow everything upon all.

  28. The thin-bodied (Devaki), good-looking in (her) pregnancy, having left thinness, with (her) increase of bulk caused by certain Luminary, obtained gradually a great (amount of) splendour like the disc of the Moon.

  29. Her waist which had increased in bulk in course of time, and which contained in it the fresh adorning Gem of Lakshmi kept secret, was (like) a box made of silver.

  30. (The people), seeing her who was increasing in bulk, who contained Krishna within, and who was like the crescent Moon with a deer in it, shining after the New Moon day, and waning gradually.

  31. She, as if thinking, ‘Let there be no burden to the earth when the Father of the Universe is in me, made the sport of slowly walking, resting herself on the hands of her friendly people.

  32. The queen with Sri Krishna within (her) never looked at herself in looking-glasses wearing jewels; (on the other hand) she desired to see herself without being seen by others, with the glass of *Nandaka*, waich shone upon the Lord.

  33. She could not bear many garlands; far away must be (even) the mention of jewels of precious stones. This was the first indication of the future removal of the burden of the earth.

  34. The dwellers in heaven, having seen her, the Fortune of the race of Devaki, who was conceiving the Store of the worlds, told her many-sided greatness, after reciting the Vedas.

  35. (Her) husband, seeing the queen who though conceiving a child never felt pain by its greatness and whose mind was concentrated on happiness alone, even

during the time of delivery, thought that she was indicating his fortune.

  36. He (Vasudeva) who had been the father of gods and demons in his previous birth, and who was (now) about to become their grandfather, with his desire for other things gone, was pleased to see Devaki conceive Vishnu.

  37. The evening came, which gives (to the worlds) coolness after the heat of the Sun which if longed for by the virtuous people, and which was, as it were, informing (the world) of such aforementioned birth of the Father of the universe.

  38. It (the evening twilight) which settled in the sky of excellent colour, which by its brightness hid that of the Sun, and which was respectable to the worlds, was like the second body of the enemy of Mura, wearing a cloth yellow like gold, hiding the brightness of the sun by its splendour, and venerable to worlds.

  39. The Sun whose big disc was red, whose fall into the western ocean had begun, shone like the summit of a (piece of) red arsenic, thrown with great force by the elephant of the evening.

  40. The Sun sinking in the sea, certainly thinking that some one would become the holder of his hands, held up (his) hands of rays to a distance (in the sky.)

  41. The Sun, red as fruit-juice, with its shining filament-like rays, sank in the sea like a lotus thrown

(into it), which had its filaments shining with splendour, which was red with (its) juice and which was taken gaily by the girl of evening twilight, from the ocean of sky.

  42. Certainly, the great serpent of day, with the disc of the sun looking like the hood-gem, having too much of the heat (of poison of its own rays) entered the gravity of the nether world.

  43. The ocean, which was like a proud fearful under quarter elephant ate, I think, underthe pretext of the evening red sun the lotus with honey (in it) brought by time.

  44. At that time when the Sun and the Moon were away, the darkness, making the eyes of all powerless, was like the smoke spread in (all) directions, of the fire which was the embodiment of sorrow of the separated.

  45. Then grew a large aerial forest, which having a large extent of thick darkness of the group of shadows, was applauded by the world.

  46. The black sky showing a heap of pearls by (its) stars, was like a canopy arranged by the servant Time for the Lord of the Universe who was going to reside (on the earth).

  47. When the sun, their husband, went away to a distance, the lotuses performed penance to obtain him (again), observing silence by the cessation of the noise of bees, shutting their eyes, and ever living in the forest of water.

  48. The ruddy geese, as if they had sympathy for the shut lotuses and lilies, sprung in them, feeling sorry (for them) and abandoning their enjoyments, made a cry which had its termination at sun-rise.

  49. The young woman of night a few minutes after the evening, covering her body with the black dress of darkness, shone, as if prepared to meet the Moon hidden by the (previous) arrangement of time, in the appointed place of the eastern mountain.

  50. The East, which was pregnant with the moon, which seemed to lay herself down upon the bed of ocean, which was worth being seen by the world, and which gave up her thinness, obtained whiteness.

  51. The East, freed from the contact of darkness, shining white, applauded by Indra, and clearly visible at the beginning of the rise of the Moon, shone, like Devaki, devoid of the touch of *Tamoguna* shining white, praised by Indra, and beautiful looking (just before) the commencement of Vishnu.

  52. (The Moon), (most) respectable of (all of) his race, who seeing that the wife of the greatest man among the Yadus was going to obtain a son, plunged in the great ocean and rose up, arrived before (the delivery) as an interested priest.

  53. The direction that was honoured by Indra, sending out the nectar-mass like Moon when the poisonlike thick darkness was removed, gave out light as the increased milk of the milk-ocean produced Lakshmi.

  54. The tops of mountains, first appeared, on account of the covering of darkness, to have been buried deep beneath the earth, (but) afterwards, being covered by the rays of the Moon, (appeared) to have been taken up (by the hands of the Moon.)

  55. Then the quarters, shone with the beams of Moon, which being mixed with the red the chalks of mountains were (like) a paste of quicksilver, andwhich were like bright arrows.

  56. The rising, curved, long crescent of the Moon was like a gold weapon clever in tearing the hearts of the separated, and aimed (at them) by Cupid with its pointing edge.

  57. Time with his unimpeded strength, sent out the half Moon having much coolness (in it), to remove the darkness in (all) quarters generally, as also the Love with his unimpeded power, discharged his sharp crescent-shaped weapon to cut away quickly the hearts of the proud women.

  58. The Moon with its beams shutting the lotuses, and with its rut-like big spot, having been plunged (in the sea) rose up from it, having removed the moss-like darkness, just like the elephant of a quarter.

  59. The quarter of Indra shone with the Moon which had risen to brighten the three worlds, which gave rise to the lustful passion, and which possessed the splendour of a red cheek, as the navel of the (Supreme) Lord

with its lotus which manifests the three worlds (through Brahman) which gives rise to the intoxicating juice, and which is red like a red cheek.

  60. The conch-shaped disc of theMoon near the ocean of all-pervading darkness, took theyellow colour as if from union with bile, brought aboutby the defective (i. e., sorrowful in the night time) eyes of men absent from home.

  61. The Moon with (its) shining redness when rising, and with (its) spot black like the eye the thin-waisted (i. e., women) was taken for the camphor of the night, with its shape variegated with musk and saffron.

  62. The Moon, giving delight to the mind, and making this world visible with (its) brightness, shone having freed (itself) from darkness and redness, as the *Satwa* quality (which gives delight to the mind, which enables us to see the whole world, and which makes the virtuous happy) does having freed itself from *Tamoguna* and *Rajoguna*.

  63. The maker of night (i. e., the Moon) possessing the splendour of the *Kunda* flower, and causing the noise of the ocean was like *Panchajanya* (or the conch of Vishnu) manifesting itself beforehand by the order of the bearer of *Chakra* who was going to be born.

  64. The Moon, possessing the beauty of the deer-skin occasioned by its deer, and making the sky visible by its *Padas* (i. e., rays) bore the likeness of the enemy of

Mura in the form of Vamana, Who possessed the splendour of the deer-skin and Who measured the sky with His *padas*, i.e., feet.

  65. The spot of the handsome-beamed Moon, shining like the mass resting on a conch-shell, conquered the mire of the sea-bottom, (partly) removed by the contact of the big waves, as (the Moon) was rising.

  66. The white-beamed maker of night (i.e. the Moon) which, having come out of the high summit of the *rising mountain*, killed the elephants of darkness with the paw of the end of its beam, and which had its spot like the smearing of the rut, obtained the state of a lion.

  67. (Persons) of amorous pastime, conjectured it (i. e. the Moon) to be the lotus flower of the Lakshmi of midnight beauty, a mass of foam of the ocean of happiness, and the oyster-shell giving birth to the pearls of stars.

  68. The milky ocean of brightness, with the large group of bubbles of stars, and with the production of nectar occasioned by the Moon, shone, having obtained the Lakshmi of splendour beautiful of all (in the world).

  69. The midnight, brightening the universe well, was, with its stars brilliant by the rising of the Moon, as it were, the obtaining, through good fortune, of the pɔwer of sight by the blind world.

  70. The Ganges of Moon-light, flowing for the reason of increasing the ocean, from the cleared sky, with

its faces on all sides, gave up (its) red colour, having absorbed the daughter of the Sun in the form of darkness.

  71. The ocean, having drunk the intoxicating juice of water given by the mouths of (its) wives, and mingling like a drunken man, with the dancers of rays of the Moon, performed a dance which was attended with billows.

  72. The crescent of the Moon which, being varie-gated (in colour) by the spot, was like the *Satwaguna* black in the centre by the *Tamoguna* shone like the half-seen sandbank of the gods’ river, containing fresh moss (on it.)

  73. The night and the daughter of Devaka, (both) containing a bright luminary within them, and (both) removing the darkness of the three worlds, bore the likeness of each other.

  74. The wise men of moon-light, who went deep into *Sakhas* (certain portions of the Vedas) or branches, appeared to search the place occupied by the ignorance of darkness, as if (with the object of) killing that portion which was left from being killed.

  75. The sky shone with the rays of the Moon, which removed the mire of the mass of darkness, and which abounded with the foam-mass of the group of stars, as with torrents of fame.

  76. The Moon-light, giving clearness to the rivers of quarters, indicating with its splendour the arrival of

swans, and driving away the clouds of darkness, shone like the splendour of the season of *Sarat*.

  77. The rays, being made to wear the undetectably false white hair, were sent (made to act), in great numbers, to (all) quarters, by the principal actor of Moon, who in the dramatic representation of
love-sports, appeared to devise sport suitable to the occasion.

  78. The wind, from which the rows of Kadamba trees learnt the dancing, and which was the source of welfare to people, was like the joyful breath of night which grew in splendour of the rising of her husband.

  79. The water-lily giving up uniting with the passionless swans, smiling beautifully, and being filled with the noises of the paramour bees, seemed to laugh at the lotus which was sleeping at a time worth trying by all.

  80. A strange splendour of the musk-painting under the pretext of the spot, was seen on the beautiful lotus-like face of night, under the pretence of the disc of the Moon.

  81. The shades on the ground under trees shaken by the wind, quivered like pieces of limbs of the elephants of darkness, whose bodies were torn to pieces by the lion of the Moon.

  82. The night possessing the beauty of the dense, fresh lilies, and mixing with the wide Moon-light which hated the wave-like darkness, shone like the Jamna with

  The rays, being made to wear the undetectably false white hair, were sent (made to act), in great numbers, to (all) quarters, by the principal actor of Moon, who in the dramatic representation of love-sports, appeared to devise sport suitable to the occasion.

  The wind, from which the rows of Kadamba trees learnt the dancing, and which was the source of welfare to people, was like the joyful breath of night which grew in splendour of the rising of her husband.

  The water-lily giving up uniting with the passionless swans, smiling beautifully, and being filled with the noises of the paramour bees, seemed to laugh at the lotus which was sleeping at a time worth trying by all.

  A strange splendour of the musk-painting under the pretext of the spot, was seen on the beautiful lotus-like face of night, under the pretence of the disc of the Moon.

  The shades on the ground under trees shaken by the wind, quivered like pieces of limbs of the elephants of darkness, whose bodies were torn to pieces by the lion of the Moon.

  The night possessing the beauty of the dense, fresh lilies, and mixing with the wide Moon-light which hated the wave-like darkness, shone like the Jamna with

  89. During the midnight, when the stars, the lilies,the ocean, and the Moon were (all) wakeful, and when all people were asleep there shone such amost sacred moment giving birth to the Lord of Gods.

  90. Then the midnight with (its) former part made up of darkness, and with (its) latter part filled with light, was for the delight of the virtuous like the interval between *Samsara* and *Moksha* (attended with) *Tamoguna* in its former part, and *Satwaguna* in its latter one.

  91. The highly-sacred night, with its already born white luminary, and with Sri Krishna visible in the middle of it, shone as if (it) obtained equality with the wife of Vasudeva.

  92. The waves of oceans (joining) with the various reflected Moons, seeing the occasion of the birth of Krishna, danced and cried as if overcome with joy.

  93. The noise of musical instruments being produced without being beaten, the heavenly songs being repeated by the quarters, and the dancing of Satwaguna being made to approach the virtuous—(thus) there wasan auspicious triple symphony.

  94. The bright lights lit in the house of Kamsa, and the troubles of sages, receiving no (kind of) obstruction (hitherto) soon reached the state of dying out without cause.

  95. Then, that Ashtami (*i.e.*, the eighth day of the lunar half of a month) which, Vishnu desiring (to grant

the wishes of Vasudeva, thought fit for His birth on became the first of days, (its) second day giving birth to Mana.

  96. Then on the day of Jayanti during that auspicious moment when the five favourable stars were in the ascendant the banner of the virtuous, the former Sandhya of Devaki gave birth to a never setting Sun, to put an end to the shutting of trouble of the lotus of all worlds.

  97. When Sri Krishna, the one root of all kinds of wealth, was born, the residence of Vasudeva obtained a shower of flowers, which adorned the regions of quarters which were wetted with sweet juice which was sent by the enthusiastic hands of the pairs of gods.

**CANTO III,**

  1. Then when the Sun of Sri Krishna took his birth, the worlds became cheerful-minded, the quarters shone being cleared of darkness, and the night obtained the splendour of the day.

  2. The heavenly nymphs being merry, danced, the Kinnaras sang wonderful songs, and the gods’ musical instruments pleased Vasudeva with its ear-happy noises.

  3. There was an incorporate voice, ‘Conquer ! conquer!’ in all the ten quarters. This (voice) with (its) full meaning referred to the unconquered Destroyer of Asuras.

  4. The clouds, being driven by the gentle wind, rendering the sky pleasant-looking with its cool tiny particles, thundered all about the sky, like the gods’ elephants, indicating the auspiciousness (of the time.)

  5. Then favourable winds blew bearing (with them) the essence of the odour proceeding from the mouths of gods’ women and being wetted with the juice-flow (proceeding from) the flowers of *Kalpa* trees dropped by gɔds feeling merry.

  6. During the festival of the birth of the Enemy of Madhu, the deities of the city of Mathura felt joy, and bestowed all gifts with their unwearied minds on the devoted people who went to them.

  7. The attentive-minded sages seeing even the unstudied collection of Vedas, (becoming as if they were) studied, seemed to feel happy in the state of Moksha.

  8. The rivers obtained (even) during the month of Sravana, such clearness as is caused by the arrival of *sharat*; the intellects of those who understood the venerable *yoga* along with the Vedas whose morale were unattackable, also (obtained) clearness.

  9. Anxieties, coming out from the minds of all living beings, and joining together in a moment,entered of their own accord into the mind of Kamsa, as rivers enter into the waters of the ocean.

  10. The houses of the demon-warriors were often filled with (omens) forecasting evil. Very often appeared hundreds of good omens in the cities of the lords of gods.

  11. At last the husband of Devaki wasmade free from fetters as from debt. What wonder isthere if the dropping down of fettersoccurs in thepresence of One Who expels all ties?

  12. Devaki bore the demon-tearer born of herself and sitting on her lap, as a wonderful sapphire summit of extraordinary splendour upon the high-land of a gold mountain.

  13. Then the Child Who, like a young sea, wore conch, wheel, *Gada*, and lotus (conch-shell, the cry of the ruddy geese and the lotus flowers) and Who was variegated in colour by the beautiful *Vanamála* (by the row of forests), caused joy to the father, being borne by the mother.

  14. Vasudeva, seeing the dangerless Father of Creators, sitting upon the lap of his beloved, the (supreme) Lord was praised by him, for His real qualities.

  15. I, with my thoughts directed to no one else, bow to Thee, Who art the origin of all and the Protector of the devotees, and Whose single wonderful form the originless sayings study consistently.

  16. Oh God of men whose existence is (rendered) dependent by the succession of the results of (their) wrong actions, only a few cross the unfordable ocean of family being favoured with Thy mercy.

  17. The creator and others, having their powers created by the self-falling water-particles of the ocean of

Thy power, enjoy the fortune of their position differing (only) by (its) limit.

  18. (Thou), Whose form is the excellent subject of the Upanishads, and Who art the Store of great *Satwa*, being driven by the wind of favour to the worlds, assumest the waves of various shapes.

  19. There is nothing in the world, animate or otherwise, which does not depend on Thee; when Thy glory has been measured thus, Sastras of various kinds, are (in the act of) simply classifying it.

  20. Oh boon-giver, having no desire for anything else, I begged Thy becoming (my) son. Who art the father of all worlds; this (request made) to Thee who holdest a vow to give the desired things, has thus ripened without effort.

  21. Not making the desire of the gods who request the removal of the burden of this earth fruitless, Oh store of mercy, it is worthy of Thee to make many sports, conquering Thy enemies.

  22. It is proper to Thee who desirest to illude the demons, to hide Thy natural marks; therefore putting an end to my fear, put on a concealment as Thou desirest.

  23. The story of mercy with His smiling countenance, seeing Vasudeva thus afraid, said :—‘You are My father; such being the case, oh father, why did you say in vain something, about this person (i. e., Myself) in an unnatural way.

  24. This, the wife of you, the father of gods, was their mother and also mine. The desired thing of you two, which shall happen in its own time, shall be done by Myself with no interruption.

  25. If you are afraid, I will take the human form; then carry me to Nanda's house in a moment; bring over his daughter (here); and be with your fears gone when I go to a distance,

  26. Then, Vasudeva, having heard the sweet-lettered slowly-flowing (words of) command of the Conqueror of Madhu, which was of unfailing character, and having understood this (i. e., the command) to be good, took Him up, who though very weighty, assumed lightness out of mercy.

  27. Vasudeva, very often saw with affection that defectless face of his Son, which had the Moon and the Sun for the eyes and the Vedas for the breath.

  28. The darkness of his ignorance being stolen away by the Moon-light of his Son's face which was fragrant with Vedas, he (i.e., Vasudeva) becoming like a sage obtained for a moment the sameness of Him (i.e., Krishna) or else he attained divinity.

  29. Vasudeva taking up (his) child of unlimited glory, and desiring to go (to Nanda's house) looked once in (all the) ten directions, being anxious with fear, when his moving was obstructed by too many safeguards.

  30. To the king of Yadus going to the station of cowherds, the door soon opened itself, the guards lay down like pieces of stone, and the domestic deities showed the way.

  31. The Moon of Yadus race found the watchmen of the night, as if with their lives going out, the parrots and *sharikas* with their sweet words, as it were, stolen away, and the servants though waking as if they were among pictures.

  32. (When Vasudeva) was going out along the street from the interior of the house, the quarters with their all-spreading darkness soon removed, shone with brightness, black as sapphire, of his Son's body shining as lily.

  33. The Veda-made bird went round and round the Lord, driving out the Rakshasas. While the earth-bearing serpent followed (Him), bearing (with it) a row of bright lights of its hood-gems.

  34. Then the head of the Yadus, being surrounded by the five weapons possessing sun-like rays and fearful-looking by tearing to pieces the body of the demons.

  35. The chariot of the Moon of Yadus’ race, having its path shown straight, moved fast with its unobstructed exploit, bearing Vishnu upon it, like the lord of birds.

  36. The wind, rendered cool with the tiny particles of drops of small waves, and rendered fragrant by its friendship with the odorous lilies, being sent by the Yamuna river, served the best of Yadus who arrived there.

  37. The land of the gardens of the Yamuna river, in front (of their path) with its hands of wind-shaken young leaves, certainly invited the lord of Yadus, with the noise of bees, having scattered flowers (on the way).

  38. The daughter of the Sun, with her eyes of black lotus flowers shut with her mouth of lotus and with the gentle poor cry of the pairs of chakrawaka birds, seemed to feel sorry at the lord's pitiable condition (brought about) by the rogues.

  39. The true-desired (Vasudeva) wanted to cross the river, which, with its shape rendered starry by the open white lilies, appeared like the night, having a form, of the season of *sharat*, and which was, as it were, a lover of the ocean, moving quickly to meet him at an appointed place.

  40. The daughter of the Sun, not knowing the sport of Sri Krishna, became actually agitated shaking her hands of waves, as if fearing—“What will happen now? What will occur in the future?”

  41. He (*i.e.*, Vasudeva), not being endangered by a succession of big waves, which were like a form of darkness, crossed the daughter of the lord of day like a (person) whose mind is (fixed) in the uninterrupted *Yoga*, and who is put to trouble by a succession of the big waves (of *Karma*) rendered sinful by the strong *Tamoguna*, crosses Samsara.

  42. The Yamuna which would naturally plunge (even) an elephant of god's, (now) with its water fordable

by feet, became one which presented the way to the lord of Yadus going and returning quickly.

  43. The daughter of the Sun, became very high on its west, with a space left on the east. (Thus) perhaps it rose to the sky, or probably it returned to its father mountain.

  44. Having crossed the Yamuna with no dam constructed and with no ship launched, (Vasudeva) carrying the strong Boat to the ocean of family, brought the Husband of Lakshmi (at last) near to the village of the cowherds.

  45. Then he entered the village of the cowherds, with its people sleeping unconsciously by some cause, in which village possessing as much wealth as the city o Kubera, Rohini had brought forth her first son.

  46. Nanda's wife, when the Child of Vasudeva, the enemy of the hell approached (her) obtained brightness, like the altar of a sacrifice, by the contact of fire, born from Arani (i.e., a kind of wood used for kindling the sacred fire by attrition.)

  47. Vasudeva placed his Son near the wife of Nanda, took up quickly the daughter of Nanda and then brought her soon to the bed of Devaki.

  48. Then the lord of the group of Bhojas, not knowing the exchange of Krishna and the girl, dropped her down upon a stone to kill her, and she beat him with the leg.

  49. Then the king being immediately beaten by the leg, acting like a ball falling and rising and being with his anger, like a mountain surrounded by fire, troubled (within himself), with his eyes shut a little.

  50. The night (of the time) of deluge, in the form of a woman, with (its) eight, big, demon-killing, lightning-like weapons, went up to the sky with an intense thunder-like noise (with its big thunders).

  51. Then she being no longer bound by the ruler of the Bhoja kings, gave (him) an account of the demon-destroyer, exactly, with loud voice, with harsh-sounding words, with no fear, in an advice-giving manner, briefly, consistently and with no disorder of words.

  52. I, the curtain deluding gods and demons, of the Destroyer of Madhu and Kaitabha have been sent (by God) to destroy Sumbha and Nisumbha. What is there to you by (having) me murdered?

  53. “The Destroyer of the enemies of the gods, being born of Vasudeva, lives in Nanda's house and He will be your destroyer”—she having (thus) said briefly went away as she desired.

  54. The king of Madhura, who was like Madhu and Hiranya, having, with his long-continued fear reached the pale state of the day-fire, showed his uneasiness by breathing, speaking, trembling and uttering ‘Hum.’

  55. He, being dull-witted, and having been laughed at by the Maya or illusion of Vishnu, set Vasudeva at liberty.

  56. He, being disturbed by confusion, troubled within himself with the self-arising thought—“something has been thought of, and it has resulted in a different way. What is this?”—which was, as it were, polluted by poison.

  57. He wished to do a number of evils to the Destroyer of demons Who is (always) beyond dangers. (When) Fate which adopts (only) one course, is impossible to be transgressed (even) by a man of resolution, what (is to be said) of one of an agitated mind?

  58. Undergoing (his) fate, by the ripened influence of anger, the impression left on his memory of his former birth (Kamsa) disgraced Sri Krishna, felt angry at Him, wondered at Him, laughed at Him and cried aloud ‘Hari.’

  59. Vasudeva lived with fear, in a house shown by Kamsa; Devaki spent hundreds of days, keeping her soul, by (having) her Son in memory.

  60. The fortunate Yasoda, who, being given sound sleep by Providence, obtained wakefulness after a long time, saw near her, the child Sri Krishna, her female child being lost.

  61. This Ornament of Upanishads, Who is even now sought after by multitudes of sages, by whom the established *Nyayas* are understood, fortunately became the ornament of the village of cowherds.

  62. The Lord made the village of the cowherds where the calves were diseaseless, the cows were not at a

loss what to do, and milk was abundant, where there was not the fear of thieves arising, and where all people were healthy, the place of Kritayuga.

  63. A number of beautiful heavenly nymphs of much splendour were born in the houses of the cowherds with the happiness of whose enjoyment, the childhood and youth of Sri Krishna the Protector, would be connected.

  64. The liberal-minded Nanda, did the great, wonderful, new festival of his son's birth, which delighted the Gods and the Brahmins, and which was disordered by the unsteady cowherds going hither and thither.

  65. He, during the great festival of the birth of his son, took away the splendour of the bountiful gem, created a secondary importance to the Kalpa tree, and caused vainness to the praise of the cloud.

  66. The husband and wife,having by means of penance brought forth the Ancient Person as (their) son, and unfortunately being for a long time kept at a distance (from him), though with their minds agitated with suspicion, were with (their) sorrow calmed by the thought of his glory.

  67. The Son of Vasudeva appearing like the new Moon, having obtained residence in the house of Nanda, attained their growth in time, which by itself was the cause of sweet enjoyment to the gods.

**CANTO IV. **

  1. Kamsa, who was Kalanemi in his former birth, and who, having heard the object of the False Man, had (his) heart sunk in fear and anger, was, for long, as if plunged in the ocean of anxiety.

  2. The cruel-hearted king, calling a certain invincible class ef Asuras, sent them to the residence of Nanda, which being protected easily by the Lord, was impossible to attack.

  3. Once an illusory being, sent by Kamsa, disguising (her) Putana form entered the village in the form of Yasoda, at midnight when the people were under the charm of sleep.

  4. Krishna drank in the life, along with the milk, of (her) who never again had (her) birth; wonder (it is) that people thinking of which, never had to become suckling once more.

  5. Having heard the intense noise of her, and the loud cry of her Son, Yasoda, being afraid, approached with haste and took Him up Who is beyond the reach of (even) the Vedas.

  6. The truth-knowing Nanda, having approached with great fear, and seeing (his) son (after all) uninjured, commended Him, the Ruler of the three worlds, to the care of Himself.

  7. The cowherds joining together saw that dead fearful-shaped, cave-eyed Rakshasa woman who, with her

noise had made the whole village echo, like another Bhymarathi night.

  8. Having cut her who was like the summit of the Vindhya mountain, to pieces, with knives just sharpened took (it) out by drawing forward a cart, as if throwing a large (amount of) offering to the flesh-eaters.

  9. The cowherds, wishing to prevent the dangers from evil demons, etc., tied an ornament in the form of the five weapons looking beautiful, being strengthened with a gold thread.

  10. The beautiful gems, becoming ornaments to Sri Krishna, were with (their) multitude of rays, as it were, with their hair standing erect on account of the happiness of touching His body.

  11. He being made to lie down on the bed, by the mother who understood how to protect (Him), threw up crying, a high cart possessing the strength of a great mountain, by strongly kicking with (His) legs.

  12. The demon, called Shakata, being torn to pieces by the contact of the end of His foot, and being scattered in many ways on the ground, greatly agitated the worlds, with a big noise.

  13. Yasoda, seeing that the cart appearing like a mountain was thrown up when her Son threw up (His) leg by chance, touched the sole of (His) foot soft as the interior of a lotus.

  14 Then, Sri Krishna beginning to move on (His) knees, toes and palms; surely the earth, feeling shame, embraced Him under the pretext of the thick dust.

  15. Then Nanda, having seen the charming-worded. countenance of His beautiful with (sits)artless soft smiles, and having, with the splendour of the ear-ring gems, a waving of lights, did not obtain satisfaction.

  16. Sri Krishna, Whose power was all-excelling and Who, alone, creates shapes and names, was the object of praise even on mentioning a part of His mother's name.

  17. His wonderful talk with female friends which even at its first utterance, had great resemblance to the Vedas was, with great correctness of letters and accents, as it were the best teaching to those who understood Sheeksha.

  18. The wife of Nanda saw, with joy and with attention to nothing else, Him Who was the imperishable eye (to all the worlds), and Who, having stood up a little, sat down not far from (the place), and on seeing (His mother) had a beautiful smile on the sprouts of teeth.

  19. The good-hearted Yasoda made Him Who, having measured the three worlds, pretended to be a child, walk slowly taking with her hand the tip of His lotus-like hand.

  20. The fortunate Yasoda, having placed on the bent waist, her son Who having got stumbled on walking two, three steps, took delight in moving with knees, made. with joy Him drink milk.

  21. Again the sport-liking (Krishna), being applauded by the wife of Nanda, gradually placed on the ground the lotus of (His) foot ever enjoyed by the bees of Upanishads. 

  22. Having as if thought, “Let not this earth be enjoyed by the enemies of the virtuous people,” he walking, stamped the earth solely with the heel and other pictures of His foot.

  23. When Sri Krishna walked slowly taking the end of the sprout-like hand of His mother as support, the earth appeared to bear through a good fortune wonderful lines of painting in the form of foot-prints.

  24. He Who, not being bound by *Karma*, always sports, controlling the worlds with a little will, wanted rest at each step being led by His mother with oozing breast.

  25. The mother helped the Creator to get up, Who with shaking lotus-likefeet, desired to ascend the steps of the courtyard-sheds rendered fragrant with heavenly flowers.

  26. During His going and coming suitably to the beating of time under the courtyard trees the village people heard the noises of Dundubhi and Turya of gods, beaten at a distance.

  27. He whose deeds had been wonderful and Who, being the Manager of the stage of the three worlds had made the movables and the immovables, the actors dance in turn, Himself danced beautifully desiring to get butter.

  28. He being, in the attempt to churn the coagulated milk in houses, sprinkled with small rising particles of it, showed His own former appearance variegated in colour by the contact of the nectar-particles.

  29. Having stolen butter, Sri Krishna becoming afraid, bending His body and lying down quietly begged with hands folded, His youth-ornaments to be silent.

  30. The Lord of Universe, the source of all fruits of different worships stated in Aranyakas (a class of religious and philosophical writings), went with a desire for the forest-fruits, to a hunter's daughter, with hands full of dropping corn.

  31. When the fruit-selling woman saw the red-centred lotus-like palm of His, with the Wheel and Conch in the shape of well-formed lines, a doubt arose in her mind as to whether she should *sell*.

  32. The Kirata woman filled with sweet fruits the folded hands of the False Child; at the same time, her fruit-basket became filled with Kaustubha-like gems.

  33. Mother wanted to tie up to a fortunate mortar, the Relative of the good often trying to steal butter, and setting the calves free even in times of not milking.

  34. He, seeing His mother feel sorry when she found even whole thread brought before Him to tie Himself insufficient, became Himself to be tied by His of power of reduction.

  35. Seeing that the *Karma* tie of those who think of the chained Krishna as such, breaks itself easily, the poor old Moral of sacrifices as if feeling shy hid herself in the stories of Aranyas (a part of Vedas.)

  36. Ignorant people saw with laugh, Sri Krishna bound to the mortar with a rope, with His eyes trembling and full of tears, like an elephant tied to a pole.

  37. As soon as the mortar drawn by chance broke two *Arjuna* trees, they at once became the two great *Yakshas* being freed from the curse of Narada.

  38. Having obtained freedom from the curse by coming in contact with Sri Krishna, they, shining with heavenly forms, reached their own abode, having praised Sri Krishna.

  39. Seeing the incidents never before seen on the earth, of Putana and others, to be evil-forebodings, the cowherds joining with Sri Krishna hastened to *Brindavána*.

  40. With what feeling Sri Krishna made the Moon the delighter of worlds, He, with the same feeling thought of the forest desiring the full welfare of cows.

  41. Sri Krishna, the Protector of the good and the moon of cowherd's race, caused the forest looking like the Earth in its youth, to luxuriate, by casting His happyside-long looks appearing like the succession of waves of the ocean of favour.

  42. In that forest, the ground was fit for the habitation of cows, the grass was as sweet as sugarcane of the best sort, and trees obtained equality with the *Kalpa* trees.

  43. Nanda, Upananda and others rejoiced to see the forest made, by the greatness of Sri Krishna, full of strange things, free from wild beasts, and respectable even to Indra.

  44. Sri Krishna feeling very happy on driving away easily Thrinavarta and other demons, enjoyed with Rama, the wonderful holy forest, praised even by the lord of Yakshas.

  45. The cowherds tied all around the forest, the eathers of Baka who appeared like Kailasa with wings; which being thus fastened, seemed like a row of comets appearing in order to drive away other venturous creatures.

  46. The cowherd virgins performed a virgin-ceremony attended with joyous songs and beatings of the drum, to win the favour, with a certain desire, of the Creator of worlds.

  47. Sri Krishna rejoiced having got up a Kunda trees taking a number of silk cloths from the bank, kept there by the cowherd girls when they went to bathe.

  48. Sri Krishna, Who was ever virtuous refusing to accept the one-hand salute of the girls who begged their silk cloths, laughed when he saw them salute with two hands each joining her hand with that of the other.

  49. The Lord shone with fresh youth which was manifesting His hidden greatness, which was the sportive ornament. of the goddess of heroes, and which was the abode of happiness of Neela and others.

  50. The youth of Sri Krishna, beautiful with sports of increasing wonder, fit for taking hold of by Cupid, and very delightful to minds, obtained sweetness like the central portion of a sugarcane, beautiful with knots, fit to be taken hold by Cupid, and delightful to minds.

  51. The women of the village thought Sri Krishna to be a wonderful safe fortress containing different armies of sports, having the fine high walls of His beauty, and having the bolt of sport.

  52. When Sri Krishna was returning, the sound of flute, the dust raised by the gambols of calyes, and His sylvan form were to cowherdesses an army of Cupid with four regiments.

  53. A cowherdess adorning with a peacock feather Sri Krishna the Head-ornament of the Vedas, attained with her physical eye the same concentration of mind as devotees do with their divine vision.

  54. The cows having taken shelter under the Ancient Moving Tamala Tree with Its lustre thickened by the peacock feathers worn in garlands, appeared like Its shade.

  55. Sri Krishna Who resembled a *tamala* tree in colour, shone with the peacock feather producing the

charm of love, as sapphire mountain does with the many-coloured splendour proceeding from the various gems.

  56. Yasoda rejoiced often touching the adorning wreath of peacock feathers worn on the head by the welfare-giving wise Young Man who charmed with flute the minds of beautiful maids.

  57. The necklace of peacock feathers hanging between the breasts of Sri Krishna appeared, onaccount of its position, as if Lakshmi shining like pure gold was turning black due to the splendour of His body.

  58. Sri Krishna saw their faces with a graceful movement of eyebrows and with speaking eyes, which being bent aside with love and shyness appeared like lotuses turned round.

  59. Sri Krishna replied with His flute the messengers of side-long looks of women, which were steadfast, dull, returning from the object with shyness and full of love.

  60. Sri Krishna, the one Abode of all worlds, and the Ocean of love, sang with sport as if delighting the whole universe, performing a new country-dance which was not taught by Tumburu, Narada and others.

  61. There was no support of hand, in the middle of the ocean of love, agitated by the Moon of Krishna's countenance, to them standing upon the sandy bottom, with open eyes, the waves rushing over them (very impatient to obtain Him for their husband).

  62. Sri Krishna, the Lover, Who was beyond all influence of Fate (whose motion is unchecked), shone with His cheeks full of sweat was in the midst of them like a big elephant (with its cheeks covered with rut), in a circle of female elephants.

  63. In spite of the enjoyment with the wives of cowherds, His chastity did not become corrupt, since this chastity was to be for its purity the means of protecting in the presence of the virtuous the life of the child Parikshit.

  64. Nanda seeing his son Sri Krishna and his relative's son Balarama, who were friends bynature, had the same feelings and thoughts, ordered them to protect the herds of calves.

  65. The Lord Who, being dependent on nobody, Himself created and protected Brahman and others, became now along with Balarama the Protector of cows under the control of Nanda.

  66. ‘How will He be able to walk, with His feet soft like sprouts, over gravelly places?’Thinking thus Yasoda with her oozing breast did not find a boat to get out of the ocean of anxiety.

  67. The two boys acting bravely like whelps, and easily threatening the beasts away, were with their everlasting glory like two strong men.

  68. Then the cowherdesses completely yielded to the love-charm, on seeing the Two Whose deeds were

wonderful, and Who being completely covered by the clouds of dust raised by calves, appeared like black and white elephants covered with red lead.

  69. When the Supreme Lord assumed the form of a cowherd, the Vedas taking the form of cows attached themselves to His feet with their auspicious cries which appeared like the echoes of ‘Havu,’ ‘Havu’ of *Samaveda*.

  70. The Lord of the Universe, though really not a child, showing to all people His dependence like a child. exemplified His sole power to bind souls in worldly life and to liberate them from it, by His sole power in binding and unbinding the cows.

  71. Then the cows appeared to receive a good teaching as to how affectionate they should be to their calves from Sri Krishna Who was feeling happy even when the calves rubbed against His feet, and Who took care of them more than of Himself.

  72. That Lord, the Greatest among gods, Whose glory is endless, and the happiness of being ever in Whose presence is enjoyed by Ananta and others, now, allowed the calves with great kindness to often lick His body.

  73. The cowherd lads of His age feeling hungry by following the calves to a distance, rejoiced when they saw Him with His hands looking beautiful with a big ball of boiled rice mixed with coagulated milk with an external covering of honey.

  74. When sweet forest fruits were shown to Him by His freiends, He first gave them to Balarama and satisfied Himself by eating the remainder with pleasure.

  75. Brindavana where many herds of cows were spread, being protected by Balarama and Sri Krishna by the order of Nanda, became highly comfortable for its richness in growth.

  76. The forest, where lakes were deep, grass was ever growing, the sun was not hot, wind was not fierce, and the cows and calves slept under the shades of trees, was happy for living in even in mid-summer.

  77. When God Narayana protected the property of Nanda, with Balarama as with His arm, there was no trouble to the cows of diseases, nor danger from demons, nor fear from tigers.

  78. During that time, when Sri Krishna was their protector, the cowherds being free from the six *ities* with their desires ever fruitful and with happiness greater than that of Moksha, felt themselves to be living in a *yuga* other than the four known ones.

  79. The life of cowherdesses went away when Sri Krishna, clever in following the calves, and pouring nectar into their ears with the sound of His flute went away, and returned when he returned.

  80. Garuda bringing the crest of Sri Krishna, which had been taken away by somebody, saw Sri Krishna

Whose path was smelt by the *Aranyakas* assuming the form of cows in the forest.

  81. The crest of the Lord lying on the milky ocean was brought by Garuda from Bali, the son of Virochana, and placed upon Sri Krishna's head adorned with peacock feather, became fit to it.

  82. Sri Krishna Who would eat only such offerings as were thrown into fire by the attentive-minded performers of frequent sacrifices, becoming easily accessible to the devoted, once ate the eatables brought to Him by the wives.

  83. He thought the calves which were stooping in front of Him, which shut their eyes by the happiness of the touch of His lotus-like hand and which became half-sleepy when He touched them from head to foot, to be bent with the weight of devotion.

  84. Sri Krishna felt Himself happy with the calves which had the corners of their mouths full of the foam of rumination, which with their half-shut eyes were motionless and which being scratched by Sri Krishna did not care even for milk.

  85. Even the barren ground appearing to the calves grassy by Krishna's rays dark-blue as those of an emerald falling upon it, they stooped and began to work with their mouths on it.

  86. He caused the milch-cows which had recently delivered and which had an incomparably great amount of

milk, to allow to drink milk their calves which getting tired of the gambols on the forest ground, returned before going far.

  87. Seeing the cows lick their calves which went to the shades of forest trees and slept under them, He thought that their affection would be appreciable even to His mother.

  88. Every day in the evening He, pouring honey with the sound of His flute, drove the cows to whose cry the calves appeared to reply with their cries, again to the cow pen.

  89. The Lord of the Universe, entering the village with the cows at its extremity, was the cause of pleasure to the cowherdesses as the sun rising at a distance is to lotuses.

  90. Sri Krishna returning when the day was drawing to its close made with His lustre pleasing to the eyes of His wives the universe appear as if covered with peacock-feathers.

  91. The boys found Him a boy and loved Him with similar thoughts and feelings, and the young women found Him a young man and loved Him with similar thought and feelings; this was either wonderfully deceiving the world or adapting His form suitably to the feelings of all.

  92. Balarama and Sri Krishna Who appeared to practise jugglery were thought to be children by the parents, young men by the young women, and ancient beings by those who were well-versed in ancient history.

  93. Then the cowherd-girls attuned suitably to the youth of Sri Krishna their maturity which with its fine accomplishments increased the power of Cupid and attracted the minds of spectators.

  94. The Great Saint was much pleased when they attained maturity which was nectar to the ocean of love and the divine elixir to *Sringara rasa.*

  95. What a bee is to fine creepers with their growing breast-like buds and with their well-increasing sport-like fragrance, the same was Sri Krishna to the beautiful-bodied cowherd-girls with their increasing bud- like breasts and their growing fragrance-like sports.

  96. Bound by His former promise Sri Krishna enjoyed the cowherdesses, as Yudishtira did Draupadi, as a result of his former penance though she was enjoyed by five persons; which therefore was free from all sin of unchastity.

  97. Having smashed to pieces the necks of the bulis which with the tips of their horns had broken mighty rocks to pieces and which appeared like quarter-elephants, Sri Krishna obtained Neela by this betting the strength of His arm.

  98. In pressing to death the wicked and mighty demon-bulls strong like thunderbolt Sri Krishna was certainly making His hand fit for the sport of pressing the breasts of His beloved.

  99. Sri Krishna considered His arms which appeared like the body of His bed-serpent, and which seemed like ironbars for protecting the earth, much blessed since they served the purpose of a cushion to Neela.

  100. Sri Krishna's enjoyment with His beloved, which was the remedy for diseases of love and its consequences, and which was an elixir that could be used at all times, was worthy to be meditated upon by sages.

  101. The cowherdesses being pursued by the arrows of Cupid received Him when He returned, with their steady looks and minds.

  102. The Son of Nanda, who should be meditated upon by wise men, being encircled near the village by the pure-hearted cowherdesses, shone as the Moon, whose disc is shared by the gods among themselves, shines in the sky encircled by stars which are themselves brilliant.

  103. Having destroyed in a palm-grove the fearful ass-shaped Dhenuka with his followers Balarama and Sri Krishna pleased their own servants well with a large number of sweet fruits which appeared like nectar-balls.

  104. Once the demon Pralamba of great strength having disguised himself like a cowherd in the midst of the group of cowherd-boys who were playing took Balarama by the shoulder and rose to the sky.

  105. Being beaten by Balarama he (the demon) fell down with his head broken to pieces as a big mountain. did formerly, being broken by Indra with his thunderbolt.

  106. When the demon was destroyed Balarama, making the quarters moonlight-smeared with his rays and spotted with his cloth, shone like the Moon just free from Rahu.

  107. Once Sri Krishna, without having Balarama with Him, reached the grazing herd of cows and calves, a river-bank never seen before, being drawn to a distance by the beauty of the forest.

  108. Sri Krishna the Beloved of all, driving the cows as he liked near the bank, saw the river Yamuna whose waters were madeas black as collyrium by the poison gushed by the serpent Kaliya.

  109. He got up to kill the great serpent, a Neepa tree looking like a dry piece of wood in the bank-forest of the Yamuna, burnt completely by the fire of poison.

  110. The dry Kadamba-branch uniting with Sri Krishna shone as if it shed joy-tears with the flowings of honey, as if it had its hairs erect out of joy by a great number of filaments, and as if it had paintings throughout by its sprouts.

  111. Having jumped down into the deep pool appearing like a small ocean, Sri Krishna, beautiful like a small Mandara mountain, agitated the river (the ocean) in order to render the water sweet (sweet when it just appeared) by removing the poison.

  112. Being beaten by the great force of Sri Krishna's fall, and being bounded by the spreading waves

the river made a fearful ncise like a drum smeared with the juice of serpent-driving plant.

  113. The sky shining with the water-particles just risen, being mixed up with the rays of Sri Krishna, appeared as if shining with a multitude of stars which drank in darkness.

  114. Seeing Sri Krishna running against them with fearful rage, like Garuda, all the serpents excepting Kaliya reached the ocean with the stream.

  115. Then when the fearful Kaliya with its mouth wide open like that of Death, rising up the surface of water coiled round Sri Krishna, He disabled it, bent its hood and stood upon it.

  116. Treading down at once the hood of *Kaliya* which appeared like a foot-basis made of sapphire with a ruby in it, Sri Krishna shone like the sun which has just emerged from the eclipse.

  117. Sri Krishna dancing upon the body of the serpent which was rendered red with the splendour of hoodgems, shone like the elephant of the west treading under its feet a cloud red with twilight.

  118. Sri Krishna, the kite-vehicler, by dispelling the vanity of Kaliya, made it to be known that the minds of those who bow at bis feet will be made free from bankering after temporal pleasures.

  119. Sri Krishna dancing upon the coil of the serpent in such a manner that His legs, knees and hips shook much, appeared like the moon severally reflected upon a number of moving waves of the ocean.

  120. Having made the hood his stage where the waves served the purpose of drums performed a bold dance, being praised by the gods.

  121. Holding the tail fast with one hand and pressing the fearful hood with one foot, Sri Krishna wished to destroy the serpent just as he would put an end to the worldly life of the devoted.

  122. His heart melting by the pitiable cries of the prostrated female serpents, Sri Krishna being propitiated, gave them the alms of their husbands. Who was not the object of His mercy?

  123. The serpent joining with its beloved praised Sri Krishna of very beautiful form, Whose actions were unchecked, Who had no equal, Who was dancing upon its hood which being slightly beaten by His dancing feet gushed forth the poison, and who was looked at with attention by the gods and others, who was being eager and hasty to see Him on the occasion, were noisy with their joyful cries.

  124. The serpent whose hood was rendered blessed by the placing thereon of Sri Krishna's lotus-like feet, joining with all its relations and finding protection nowhere

else, sought shelter in the middle of the ocean which is the bed fit for Him to sleep on at the end of the Yugas.

  125. When the crowd of serpents was driven away by Sri Krishna, the river Yamuna obtained great clearness with its water useful to sages, like the three Vedas whose dependent Sastras were read when all the other religions were put down.

  126. When the evil (the sin) of its union with the serpent (paramours) was removed by Sri Krishna and when it was made holy (by Himself bathing in its waters), the daughter of the Sun became highly respectable even to the river Ganges.

  63. This is *the* point in the life of Sri Krishna. The unscrupulous critics, not knowing the inner truth of this aspect of Krishna's life, hold that He was merely sensuous. The post here defends Him, not from prejudice, but from an incident which not only exposes the critics’ view as hollow but even betrays their utter ignorance, nay even incapacity in matters which demand an absolute impartiality, in knowing what Truth is. The incident referred to here is—On hearing his father's death, Aswathaman taking a vow to extirpate the Pandavas, discharged the अपाण्डवास्त्रम्, by which the five young sons of Pandavas were killed, and even Parikshit while in the womb.
