**INTRODUCTION**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1\. KALIDASA —THE AUTHOR.

 It is a matter of great pity that we possess practically no **(1)** His Life. trustworthy account of the presonal life of Kálidása, the greatest Indian poet. Like most of the other poets of Sanskrit he has observed complete silence about himself, and following his example, later writers too have abstained themselves from throwing any light on his personal history. Therefore the only sources to know something about him are, first, a number of traditions prevalent in the later period of classical Sanskrit, and, secondly, a few direct and indirect references contained in his works. The traditions associate too many interesting incidents with his name. At one place, for instance, he is said to have been a dúnce in his youth and later on to have got his enlightenment through the igrace of the goddess Kálí, whence he is known as Kálidása. Another tale says that he owes his skill in poetry to his wife. A third one describes him as a shepherd by birth and a contemporary of King Bhojs of Dhárá (1200 A. D.). One more asserts that he met with his death at the hands of a courtesan in Ceylon. But it is doubtful if any of these and other allied tales are of any real worth in studying Kálidása. What seems probable is that the incidents of some other Kálidása have been ascribed to the Kálidása of the Raghuvamsham and the Kumárasambhavam, who was the most famous of them. That there have been a number of poets of Sanskrit, who bore the name, Kálidása is proved by the following couplet of Rajashekhara, who knew at least three of them:—

‘एकोऽपि जीयते हन्त कालीदासो न केनचित्।  
शृङ्गारे ललितोद्‌गारेकालिदासत्रयी किमु॥’



 In all this heap of fiction and legends only one thing is certain *viz.*, that he was a contemporary of King Vikramáditya. But to identify this Vikramáditya is by no means an easy task. More than one king bore this name and several others used it as a title. There was one Vikramáditya who founded the Vikrama Era in 57 B. C., while Chandragupta II (413 A. D.) and Samudragupta (480 A. D.) of the Gupta dynasty had adopted the word as an epithet. Now which of these Vikramádityas was our poet's patron is a puzzle, which still remains unsolved,

 To come to the second source of information, namely, the evidence gathered from the references contained in his works we may hold it to be more reliable, though not infallible. On the authority of these references it can be said that he was a Bráhmana by caste and a devotee of Shiva by faith. His vivid and exact description of Ujjayiní, Kashmere, the Himálaya and some cities as well as parts of Nothern India, lead the reader to infer that he had been personally to all these places. He was fully familiar with the life at royal courts and seems to have lived, unlike Bhavabhúti and Mágha, prosperous, happy and popular life. Though fond of pleasures he was not licentious. He had a great regard for the fair sex and a noble idea of its chastity. This is warranted by the text of the Shakuntala. He was an all-round scholar, possessed of a sound knowledge of the Vedic principles, Upanishadic philosophy, Pauránika mythology, various Darshanika systems, grammatical and prosodical rules, medical science and astronomy.

 As has already, been remarked, the problem of Kálidása's date **(2) His Date.** is by no means an easy one, and it is nothing more than conjectures that we can take recourse to. To sum up the various theories on the subject we may divide them into two main groups. The adherents of the one hold that he flourished in the first century B. C. and was a contemporary of king Vikramaditys, the founder of the famous



Vikrama Era, while the followers of the other put him in the fifth or sixth century A. D.

 The arguments advanced by the former group may be summed up as follows:—

** 1.** The state of the law of inheritance and the severe penalty for theft and other crimes, as referred to in the Shá

kuntala, point to the state of society and law as it existed prior to the Christian Era.

** 2.** Similarities in the works of Ashwaghoshs, a Buddhist philosopher and poet of the first century A. D. Kálidása lead one to place the latter before the former, because the possibility is that Ashwaghosha borrowed from Kálidása and not *vice versa.*

** 3.** A medallion discovered at Bhitá, near Allahabad, on which is engraved a scene of two maidens watering plants and a king chasing a deer, and which is held to belong to the first century B. C. is considered by some scholars to represent the scene of the first Act of the Shákuntala. Hence the drama must have been composed before it.

** 4.** Vatsabhatti, the author of the Mandasor inscription (472 A. D.) draws help from the poetry of Kálidása, therefore, Kálidása must have lived prior to the beginning of the fifth century A. D.

** 5.** Last but not the least, is the evidence of his style which is quite different from that of the writers of the medieval Sanskrit period. Kálidása's style is simple, while the later writers find pleasure in embellished composition abounding in long compounds, difficult puns, etc.

 It is on the basis of such evidence that scholars like Dr. Peterson believe that Kálidása stands near the beginning of the Christian Era, if, indeed, he does not overtop it.

 The main arguments of the other group may be put forth thus:—



 **1.** Kálidása's language (specially his Prákrita) and style show a clear advance over those of the two earlier poets Bhása and Ashwaghosha, who flourished in the first century B. C. and first century A. D. respectively.

** 2.** Kálidása's works point to the state of perfection of Sanskrit literature which was attained during the reign of the Gupta kings, which period is known in the history as the "Golden Age for Brahmanism and Sanskrit."

** 3.** There is a probable reference to Chandragupta II Vikrámaditya (413 A. D.) in the title of the Vikramorvashiyam and to his son, Kumáragupta in the name of the Kumárasambhavam, and the remarkable allusion to the horse-sacrifice in the Málavikágnimitram may remind one of Samudragupta's horse-sacrifice.

** 4.** The works of Kálidása seem to be describing the social, political, religious and economical conditions of the Gupta period.

** 5.** The allusion to the Húna kings in the Raghuvamsham suggests that Kálidása lived after their invasion of the Punjab, which is dated in the sixth century A. D.

 From these arguments it must be clear that there is nothing conclusive and both the groups of scholars rely only on conjectures. In such circnmstances the most that can be said is that Kálidása lived before 634 A. D., because he has been mentioned by name in the Aihole inscription of that date and also by Báṇabhatta in his Harshacharitam, of the same time, or that he can safely be placed in the fifth century A. D. To say beyond that is open to serious opposition.

** (3)** **His Works** As many as forty-one books have been ascribed to the pen of Kálidása, but that is highly doubtful.Many of them are evidently unworthy of the name and seem to have been passed in his name by some bogus writers to win popularity for their compositions, or they belong



to some other Kálidása. Thus out of the long list only six are universally acknowledged as his own and some doubt is expressed about the genuineness of the seventh, viz., Ritusambaram. These seven may be classified as following:—

[TABLE]

** (4) His Art—*Style, etc.*** Kálidása is one of the most brilliant jewels in the diadem of goddess Saraswati and he is unquestionably the best poet of Sanskrit literature. If Bhavabhuti attempts to share with him the laurels of Sanskrit drama and Bharavi, M*á*gha or Shríharsha of Sanskrit K*á*vya, there is none who can vie with him in both of these branchies of literature put together. His Reghuvamsham is one of the best of Sanskrit Kávyas and the Sh*á*kuntalam is far the best of Sankrit dramas. Though the traditional vere:—

‘उपमा कालिदासस्य भारवेरर्थगौरवम्।  
नैषधे पदलालित्यं माघे सन्ति त्रयो गुणाः॥

is, so far as our poet is concerned, a compliment in the right direction, it is not in the use of similes alone, but in the excellences of poetry in general, that he excels all other Sanskrit posts. Unlike the compositions of B*á*nabhatta and Danḍin, in his works aentiment predominates the outer embellishments, and in contrast with Bh*á*sa and Ashwaghosha, his language and style are quite in conformity with his noble imagination. He is the master of language as well as of poetic fancy.

 His style is simple, pure and chaste. It is brief as well as clear. The language flows without interruption and long compounds, involved construction and difficult puns are absent



from it. It is easy but not without due ornamentation (See Kumárasambhavam, Canto 5— verses 4, 18 and 78) He does not use any redundant particles or other words, which are used so frequently in the epics in order to complete the number of syllables prescribed for a stanza. It is difficult to find out any words in his composition of verse which do not contribute something or other to their meaning and do not help in advancing the story farther. Thus his poetry is free from both the loose construction of the epics and the affected compositions of the later writers. For this he can be compared to Virgil, the immortal author of Aeneid. His style is of the Vaidarbha class, which consists of firmness and evenness of sound, perspicusty, uniformity, grace, tenderness, clearness of meaning, dignity of epithets. vigour, elegance and the use of metaphorical exoressions. In accordance with the spirit of this style he prefers suggestion to elaboration.

  One distinctive feature of Kálidása's poetry is his love of nature. It is his vivid and life-like descriptions of natural scenery and natural objects, such as the Himálaya, Mánasa lake, ocean, the Ganges, etc., which have won for him the title of “Poet of Nature”His descriptive powers are remarkable and while describing nature he strikes us as a part and parcel of it. One thing worth noticing in this connection is that he ascribes human feelings and even actions to insnimate objects of nature, which makes the scene very effective. (See Kumára 5—17.25). This is known in Euglish as “Pathetic fallacy”and, in this respect, he may be compared to Wordsworth of English literature.

  Kálidása has also succeeded in entering deep into human heart. His observation of its workings and feelings is remarkable and the manner in which he gives vent to them has added

\* 'श्लेषः प्रसादः समता माधुर्यं सुकुमारता। अर्थव्यक्तिरूदारत्वमोजः कान्तिः समाधयः॥' काव्यादर्श १४१।



much to his glory. In the words of Humboldt "Tenderness in the expression of feelings and richness of creative fancy have assigned to him his lofty place among the poets of all nations." (See Kamara 5—1, 26, 67 and 58.) His poetry is also profusely interspersed with the statement of "Universal truth". (See Kumara 5—45, 64, 75, 82 and 86). This shows his correct reading and vast experience of the workings of human mind and nature surrounding it.

 Of figures of speech, simile is his favourite and his poetry abounds in exceptionally charming use of it. (See Kumara 5—52, 61.) Bat he does not seem to have neglected other important figures of sense. Thus he is equally rich in the employment of fancy **(उत्प्रेक्षा)** (see Kumara 5—25, 27 and 41). corroboration **(अर्थान्तरन्यास)** (See Kumara 5—5.31 and 64) and illustration **(दृष्टान्त)** (see Kumara 5—4), and one should not be taken by surprise to see that he also uses the figures of sound whenever suitable for his text and this he does with great skill. Of the figures of sound alliteration **(अनुप्रास)** and repetition of syllables **(यमक)** are most common. Thus, one can say that Kálidása is a master of sense as well as of words.

 These qualities have won for him an unqualified praise from Indian as well as foreign critics and poets. In India he is regarded as "The lord of poets" **(कविकुलगुरु)\*** and his poetry as sweet as “honey-laden flowers.”† He is an unrivalled poet † and his Shá

kuntala is the most charming of dramas §

 Sir William Jones, who was the first to translate the Shá

kuntala into English, styles him as “the Indian Shakespeare.” Professor Lasson pays his tribute to him by calling him“the brightest star in the firmament of Indian poetry,”and the following compliment for the Shákuntala from Goethe, the great German poet is a well-known one:—

 “Wouldst thou the young year’s blossoms and the fruits of its decline,

 And all by which the soul is charmed, enraptured, feasted, fed?

 Wouldst thou the earth and heaven itself in one sole name combine?

 I name thee, O Shakuntalá, and all at once is said.”

**II. THE KUMARASAMBHAVAM—THE POEM.**

 (1) The Poem—

**General remarke.** The Kumárasmbhavam is a Mahákavya. It is divided into cantos, its hero is a divine personage, possessing the qualities of a Dhírodátta hero, its predominant sentiment is **शृङ्गार** having **करुण** and **शान्त** as its accessories; its plot is mythological, it contains descriptions of cities, season, natural scenery, etc. Thus it fulfils the conditions laid down in the definition of a Mahákávya.

 The size of the Kumárasambhavam is a matter of controversy. Some recensions of the poem consist of 17 cantos while some scholars say that it has 22 cantos. But the general belief is that only the first eight (1—8) cantos are from the pen of Kálidása and the rest were interpolsted by some of the writers afterwards. Mallinátha, the well-known commentator has annotated only upto the eighth canto, and the main incident of the poem vis., the birth of Kurmára, only potential also has been reached in the eighth canto, so the story may



be regarded as complete after it. The contents of the later contos have little bearing on the main theme, and their style also convincingly indicates that cantos 9—17 are not from the pen of the writer of the first eight cantos.

 For the theme of the Kumárasambhavam, Kalidása has chosen a story of divine beings, which provides him an opportunity to take the loftiest flights of imagination. The scene of incidents is the grand Himálaya, which, with its beautiful valleys and slopes, affords an occasion for describing natural scenes. The descriptions of Párvatí, a young, beautiful maiden full of yearning to win over Shiva, have been completed with great skill. Her dismay at the defeat of Kámadeva and the following determination to win over Shiva by means of severe austerities reveal that Kalidása had powers to see into the emotional side of Parvati's heart. The honesty and sincerity with which Párvatí practises penance have been disclosed with remarkable success, and the dialogue between an ascetic and Parvati is one of the best pieces of its kind in Sanskrit poetry. Turning to the other incidents of the poem, no other poet would have been able to do so much justice to the imaginary attack of Káma on Shiva, the victory of the latter upon the former and the pitiable lamentation of the bereaved Rati. All this combined with the inherent qualities of Kálidása's pen has achieved for the poem a high place in the line of the Sanskrit Mahákávyas, and one feels fully in concordance with Dr. Ryder in thinking that “there are passages in *the birth of the* *War-God* of a piercing beauty which the world can never let die.

** The Source of the Poem**Kálidása has generally taken the theme of his poems from the ancient stock of stories, the Meghadútam and the Málavikágnimitram being the only exceptions. Some of his works deal with historical stories while others with mythological legends. The



Kumárasambhavam belongs to the latter class as the story of Shiva and Párvati is only a mythological one. It is very ancient and is mentioned in a number of Purá

nas, but none of them has done so much justice to it as the Shiva Purána. Kálidása also seems to have borrowed the plot for his poem from this Purána, but after borrowing the bare outlines, he, with the help of his poetical genius and rich fancy has given the story a new aspect.

** (3) The Title.**As has been remarked the chief incident of the story is the birth of Kumára, an issue of Shiva and Párvatí, so the poem has been named as Kumárasambhavsm." This name can be derived as **कुमारस्य (कार्त्तिकेयस्य सम्भवः(उत्पत्तिः) कुमारसम्भवः, स एवभेदोपचारात् कुमारसंभवं महाकाव्यम्***i e.,*the birth of Kumára; the name denotes the poetry describing it by" the transference of an epithet,, or, **कुमारस्य सम्भवः कुमारसम्भवः, वर्णितोऽस्मिन् काव्ये तत् कुमारसंभवम्** *i.e*, the poem in which the birth of Kumára has been described will be called Kumársambhavam.

 For the benefit of students we give below a summary of **(4) The Story.** the story of the first eight cantos in English:—

 **Canto 1.—** At the outset the reader meets with a graphic description of Himálaya, the lord of mountains. From his wife Menáhe had a son and a daughter, named Maináka and Párvati respectively. The latter is mentioned to have been in her previous birth Sati, the daughter of Daksha and the wife of Shiva. Then follows a description of Párvati's childhood and youth. When she is of marriageable age, her father is informed by Nárada, the ever-travelling sage, that she would be married to Shiva, Hearing this, Himálaya sends his daughter with her two friends to wait upon Chiva, who had adopted the life of an ascetic after the death of his wife Satí.



*** Canto 2*.—**Simultaneously with this the gods were being very much harassed in heaven by a demon, named Táraka, to get rid of whom they go to Brahmá. They relate all their troubles to him and in reply are told that the only person who could rescue the world from the clutches of this demon would be the son of Shiva. At this the gods think of the marriage of Shiva and are informed by Brahmáthat Párvatí, who was waiting upon Shiva, was the only suitable match for Shiva, and that the son got through their marriage will serve their purpose.

* **Canto 3*****.—** Then to create the passion of love in the heart of Shiva, Indra calls on Kámadeva, who accompanied by Vasant (the Vernal Season) as his helper, sets out on his mission. The nature surrounding Shiva, all of a sudden, puts on the garb of the spring season, all its objects, animate or inanimate, are filled with the passion of love. Shiva too for a while seems to be yielding to it, but very shortly consciousness is awakened in him. He holds Káma responsible for the disturbance, and being angry with him, reduces him to ashes by means of the fire coming forth from his third eye. Suspecting danger, Himálaya takes away his daughter and the plan of the gods seems to have been frustrated for the time being.

*** Canto 4.*—**Káma's sad end causes great grief to his wife Ratí who had accompanied him in his adventure. She weeps biterly and piteously and decides to breathe her last by burning herself with the body of her beloved. But an incorporeal speech pacifies her by giving an assurance that her separation from Káma was only temporary and that she would again be united with him.

*** Canto 5.*—**Párvatí, who had fallen in love with Shiva and whom she wanted to marry, seeing her object undone by the



demise of Káma, decides to win over her beloved by means of severe penance. Her mother dissuades her but she turning a deaf ear to her and taking permission of her father goes to a peak of the Himálaya to practise austerities. She repairs to the place with her friends and commences her penance with all seriousness. Taking the vow of asceticism, she puts оп the dress of ascetics, and not minding the severity of elements, continues to mortify her body. She becomes renowned as an ideal ascetic and sages from far and near come to visit her. One day she is called on by a young ascetic,who was none but Shiva in disguise. First he pays a befitting tribute to the pious life of Párvatíand then asks her the reason of her penance and knowing it to be to win over Shiva as her husband, he begins to point out the various defects of Shiva, such as his fondness for inauspicious things, his unknown birth, his poverty, etc., and expects Párvati to give up her determination. But Párvatí, true to her sincerity, gives a suitable reply to all his arguments and gives a decisive proof of her adherence to Shiva. At this the visitor appears in his real form and declares himself to be her slave. This fills Párvatí's heart with great joy.

* **Canto 6.*****—**

Being advised hy Párvatí to procure her father's approval, Shiva despatches the Seven Sages to Himálaya for the purpose. They are received at his capital with proper ceremony, and, on being asked by Himálaya, they disclose the object of their visit. Himálaya is too glad to hear it and readily gives his consent to the proposal. The sages after fixing the day for marriage return to Shiva and preparations for it are forthwith undertaken.

* **Canto 7*****.—**

Due festivities begin at the capital of Himaláya and preliminary rites in connection with the marriage are performed. On the fixed day,. Shiva with all his atten-



dants and gods reachas to‚ place‚ of Himálaya, where the party is received with due honour. The procesion of the bridegroom is enjoyed withparticular interest by theinhabitantsof the town. then the marrige ceremony is performed, and it being over the guest depart, butShiva stays to live there.

* Canto 8.*—

This canto open with a description of love affairs of the newly married couple. After staying at his father-in-law's house fer one month, Shiva with Párvatíleaves the place for a honeymoon trip, during which he pays visits to varions places of interest. On reaching Gandhamádana, he select it for his residence and lives there with his consort in continuous pleasures. One night they drink wine and spend the night in connubial pleasures.

Or. here, as Mallinatha comments, **स्थिरचित्ता** who was firm-minded; who was determined to achieve her object at any cost. *Cf*. **'महाकार्ये** **कृतोद्योगो विघ्नैराहतमानसः। प्रारब्धं न त्यजति यः स मनस्वीति कथ्यते।' विनि** is added by **'असमाया मेधा स्रजो विनिः' पा० ५.२.१२१। मनेारथज्ञं—(मनोरथ+√ज्ञा+कः) जानाति इति ज्ञः। मनोरथस्य ज्ञः मनोरथज्ञः तं** who knew her desire. **ज्ञः**is formed from**√ज्ञा** by adding **कः** to it by **'इगुपधज्ञाप्रोकिरः कः' पा०. ३.१.१३५। पितरं—हिमवन्तम्**Himavat. This is the secondary object **(गौण कर्म)** of **अयाचत** which governs two objects. **आसन्नसखीमुखेन—(आ +√ सद् + क्तः) आसन्नायाः सख्याः मुखेन (तत्पुरुष)** or **आसन्ना चासौ सखी आसन्नसखी;आसन्नसखी एव मुखं (उपायः) तेन (कर्मधारय)** through a



confidant friend. **आसन्नसखी** lit, means a friend sitting near, but the sense is **'**a reliable friend, or a friend who was in her confidence.**' मुखं** means **साधनं; उपायः** *Cf*. **'मुखं निःसरणे वक्त्रे प्रारम्भोपायेोरपि' इति विश्वः । फलोद‌यान्तायफलस्य उदयः (प्राप्तिः) अन्ताः यस्य, तस्मै** *i.e.* which will last till its fruit is achieved. **तपः समाधये—तपसः समाधिः तपः समाधिः,** **तस्मै तपोनियमार्थम्** to perform austere penance. Or, **तपसि समाधिः तपः समाधिःः, तस्मै** for contemplation. In former case **समाधि** means **नियम** (a rigid rufe of conduct) and in the latter **ध्यान** (contemplation). **'समाधिर्ध्याननीवाक नियमेषु समर्थने' इति विश्वः** । The Dative is used for a noun expressive of the purpose for which any thing is done **(तादर्थ्ये चतुर्थी वाच्या)** or, it is used for the object governed by an infinitive not actually used **(तपः समाधिं कर्त्तुम्)** as in case of **तपसे** in stanza **3** above. **अरण्यनिवासं—अरण्ये निवासं** residence in forest. This is the Principal object **(प्रधान कर्म)** of **अयाचत। अयाचत—**begged. It is Imperfect **(लङ्)** of **√याच्** to beg, which governs double accusatives according to the following Karika—**दुह् याच् पच् दण्ड् रुधि प्रच्छि चि‌ ब्रू शासु जि मन्थ् मुषाम्। कर्मयुक् स्यादकथितं तथा स्यान्नी हृ कृष् वहाम्॥'**

Aorist **(लुङ)** of **√भू '**to be**'** **जटाभिः—**by means of matted hair. The difference between ordinary hair and matted hair **(जटा)** is that the former are oiled, combed and decorated in other ways to enhance the beauty of the face, but no such care is taken in the case of the latter, which are allowed to grow in a natural way. **अपि—**also. The poet means to say that Parvati's face being handsome looked as much pretty with matted hair



as with ordinary haireven ugly things can not mar the beauty of a really beautiful thing. This very idea is supported by the next two lines of the stanza. **पङ्कजं—(पङ्क+√जन्+डः) पड्के पङ्कात् वा जायत इति** a lotus. **षट्पदश्रेणिभिः—पट् पदानि येषां ते षट्पदाः (भ्रमराः) तेषां श्रेणिभिः (पङ्क्तिभिः)** swarms of bees.

The compound is **बहुव्रीहि** according to **'तेन सहेति तुल्ययोगे' पा० २. २. २८*******i.e*. the particle **सह** may be compounded with a noun in the Instrumental Case in a Bahuvrihi when there is equal participation in some action; in this case **सह** optionally becomes **स।**

Before taking to the life of ascetism Parvati used to paint her lower lip with lac—dye, but, now she could not attend to such decorations. **अधरात्—**from the lower lip. **स्तनाङ्गरागारुणितात्। अङ्गरागः—विलेपनम्** scented cosmetic; application of unguents to the, body (especially after bath) **अरुणितात्—रक्तीकृतात्** reddened. **अरुण+इतच् ( 'तदस्य संजातं तारकादिभ्य इतच्' पा० ५. २. ३६) स्तनयोः अङ्गरागेणा अरुणितात्** reddened by the unguent of her breasts.

The hands were no longer employed for the two acts mentioned above. **कुशाङ्कुरादानपरिक्षताङ्गुलिः—कुशस्य अङ्कुराणां आदानेन परिक्षता अङ्गुलयो यस्य सः** the fingers of which were pricked while plucking the tender blades of kusha grass. **अक्षसूत्रप्रणयी—(प्रणयः+इनिः) अक्षाणां सूत्रस्य (रुद्राक्षमालायाः) प्रणयो (प्रेमवान्)** the friend of the rosary of Aksha beads, *i.e*., the hand was employed in counting the beads. **कृतः—**was made. The poet means to say that on assuming the role of ascetics, Parvati substituted pluckingthe



kusha grass and counting of beads for painting of the lower lip and playing with the ball.

The verse indicates a remarkable change in the life of Parvati. For this *Cf.*

**विलोलदृष्टं (कर्मधारयः)** unsteady glances. Here **दृष्टं (√दृशः+क्तः)** is a noun and not a Past Part. **द्वयं—द्वौ अवयवा यस्य तत् द्वयं (द्वि+अयच्)** the two things; having two parts; a pair, **अयच्** is added by **'द्वित्रिभ्यां तयस्य अयज्वा' पा० ५.२.४३ ।** The alternative form is **द्वितयं।** Similarly we have **त्रितयं** or **त्रयं** (having three parts) from **त्रि। तन्वीषु—कृशासु** slender. **तन्वी** is fem. **from तनु। हरिणाङ्गनासु—हरिणानां अङ्गनाः, तासु (मृगीषु)** female deer. **द्वये—**with the two. It is Locative Singular. **निक्षेपः—न्यासः** a deposit. **अर्पितं—दत्तं** was given; was kept. The poet imagines that Parvati who was leading the life of asceticism could not use graceful movements and unsteady glances, hence she had deposited them with creepers and female deer respectively, who used them freely.

**तन्द्रिता अतन्द्रिता अनलसा** without being slack.

The suffix **कन्** is added by **'ह्रस्वे' पा० ५.३.८६ । घटस्तनप्रस्रवणैः—घटौ एव स्तनौ, तयोः प्रस्रवणैः प्रसृतैः ययोभिः** with outpourings from breast-like jars. **प्रस्रवण—(प्र+स्रु+ल्युः) प्रस्रवन्ती कर्त्तरि ल्युः—यु** of **ल्यु** is changed to **अन।** For a similar idea see **'यो हेमकुम्भस्तननिःसृतानां स्कन्दस्य मातुः पयसां रसज्ञः' रघु० २.३६. व्यवर्धयत्—(वि+√वध्+लङ्) अपोषवत्** reared up. **गुहः** Name of a son of Shiva and Parvati, (popularly regarded as god of war,



because he leads the hosts of Shiva against the demon hosts). He is also known as Kumara, Skanda or Karttikeya. The name Guha may be derived as **गूहति देवसेनां इति** or ‘**स्कन्दत्वात्स्कन्दतां प्राप्तो गुहावासाद्‌गुहोऽभवत्’***i.e,* he is called Guha because he was reared in a cave. **प्रथमाप्तजन्मनाम्—प्रथमं आप्तं (प्राप्तं) जन्म यैस्ते तेषां** who were born before;being first-born. Parvati being still unmarried Guha was not born as yet and all her affection for her children was devoted towards the small trees she reared up. **पुत्रवात्सल्यं वत्सलस्य भाषः वात्सल्यं (वत्सल+ष्यञ्)** affection. **पुत्रस्य वात्सल्यं पुत्रवात्सल्यं** motherly affection; affection for one's child. The compound may also be expounded as **पुत्रोचितं वात्सल्यं पुत्रवात्सल्यम् (मध्यमपदलोपी तत्पुरुषः)। न अपाकरिष्यति—न दूरीकरिष्यति** will not set aside. The idea is that even after the birth of Guha, Parvati will continue to love them.

The fawns were so much tamed that they would not mind the presence of Parvati's friends. **अभिमीत—(√माङ्+लङ्)** Measured. Imperfect 3rd person Sing. of **√मा** 'to measure.' **माति (लट्) ममौ (लिट्) मास्यति (लृट्) अमासीत् (लुङ्)।** Some commentators, thinking it improper for Parvati to compare her own eyes with those of the fawns, construe the third and the fourth lines as—**कुतूहलात् तदीयैः नयनैः पुरः सखीनां लोचने अभिमीत** *i. e.*, out of curiosity she measured the eyes of her friends before her **(पुरः)** with theirs. But this does not seem to be the idea of the author, who is expected to describe the eyes of Parvati and not those of her friends, and, secondly in that case we would expect **सखीनां लोचनानि** and not **सखीनां लोचने ।**

These four adjectives describe the daily routine of Parvati's life. **दिदृक्षवः—(√दृश्+सन्+उ) द्रष्टुं इच्छवो दिदृक्षवः,** or **द्रष्टुमिच्छन्ति दिदृक्षन्ति, ते दिदृक्षवः** desirous of seeing (her).

The expression **काञ्चनपद्मनिर्मितं** does not only mean that her body was of fair complexion, but also that it possessed the hardness and power to resist destructive forces of gold and the softness and beauty of lotus. The poet gives reason for calling the body as such **प्रकृत्या—स्वभावेन** by nature. **ससारं—सारेण सह इति ससारम् (कठिनं बलयुक्तं वा)** hard; full of substance. 19.

** NOTES:—शुचौ—ग्रीष्मे** during the hat season. It is also used for one month only, *viz*., **आषाढ** or **ज्येष्ठ।** For the various meanings of **शुचि** * Cf.* **'शुचिग्रीष्माप्निश्रृङ्गारेष्वाषाढे शुद्धमन्त्रिणि, ज्येष्ठे च पुंसि धवले शुद्धेऽनुपहते त्रिषु।' इति मेदिनी ज्वलतां—(√ज्वल×शत्तृ) दीप्तिमतां** burning, blazing. **चतुर्णां—**of four (fires). While practising the **पञ्चाग्नितप,** four ffires are placed on all the four sides, and the Sun serves the purpose of the fifth fire. **हविर्भुजां—हविः भुञ्जते इति 'हविभुजः, तेषां** which consume the oblations *i. e.,* fires. Its another synonym is **हुतभुक्। मध्यगता—मध्यं गता (मध्ये स्थिता)** sitting in the midst. **शुचिस्मिता—शुचि (शुद्धं) स्मितं (हसितं) यस्याः सा** of bright smile; of sweet smile. Mark, here **शुचि** means **'**bright,**'** while in the first line it means **'**the hot season.**'स्मित** Smile. The **√स्मि '**to smile**'** means **'**to wonder**'** when preceded by **वि,** e. g. **विस्मित।** The use of this Adjective shows that Parvati did not mind the hardship of penance enance in the least and maintained the same happy mood as, before. **सुमध्यमा—सु (शाभनः) मध्यमः** **(कटिः) यस्याः सा** of beautiful waist; slender-waisted; a graceful woman. **नेत्रप्रतिघातिनीम्** **प्रतिघातिनी—(प्रति+√हन्+णिनिः+ङीप्) प्रति हन्तुं शीलमस्या इति प्रतिघातिनी** Dazzling; repulsing. **घातिनी** is formed by adding **णिनि** to **√हन्, ह** of which is changed. to **घ** and **न** to **त। नेत्रयोः प्रतिघातिनी,** **तां** dazzling the eyes. **प्रभां—तेजः** lustre (of the Sun). **विजित्य—**having conquered. The idea is that Parvati became accustomed to fix her eyes on the Sun. **अनन्यदृष्टिः—न अन्यस्मिन् दृष्टिः यस्याः सा** not looking at anything else. **सवितारं—सुवति इति सविता, तं** the Sun, lit.; who impels creatures to action



or who is the producer of things. **ऐक्षत—(ईक्ष+लङ्)** gazed at. The penance referred to in this verse is known as **पञ्चाग्निसाधन,** which is a very severe type of asceticism, and means self-nortification by means of five fires. It is also mentioned in Raghu XIII. 41. **'हविर्भुजां एधवतां चतुर्णां मध्ये ललाटन्तप सप्तसप्तिः।'**

The beautiful face of Parvati being reddened by the heat of the sun looked like a red lotus. **श्यामिकया—कालिम्ना** by darkness Instru. of **श्यामिका। अपाङ्गयेः—नेत्रप्रान्तयोः** of the outer corners of the eyes. **दीर्घयोः** because long corners of eyes are one of the marks of beauty. **शनैः** **शनैः—**by and by. A sudden darkness would have marred the beauty of the face. **पदं** **कृतम्—***i.e.,* made appearance. The word **केवलं** indicates that no other part of the face, except the long corners of the eyes, was darkened by the heat of the Sun.

** NOTES :—नभश्चरेण—नभसि (आकाशे) चरति इति नभश्चरः, तेन** which wanders or moves in the sky *i. e.,* the sun. **इन्धनसंभृतेन। संभृत—(सम्+√भृञ्+क्तः) प्रदीप्त** kindled or lighted. Lit. fed or maintained. **इन्धनेन संभृतः, तेन** kindled by fuel, *i. e.,* ordinary fire. **विविधेन—नाना प्रकारेण** Various, *i. e.*, the five fires referred to in the 20th shloka above. Some books read **द्विविधेन** in place of **विविधेन** which means 'twofold', *i. e,* one in the sky and the other on earth which is maintained with fuel. This seems to be a better reading, because, though five in number they are of two kinds only. **वह्निना—अग्नि।** It is used in the sense of things 'possessing heat.'



**निकामतप्ता—निकामं (अत्यर्थं) तप्ता, निकामतप्ता** extremely heated. **तपात्यये-तपस्य** **(ग्रीष्मर्तोः) अत्ययः (नाशः), तस्मिन्** At the end of the summer. **तपः** the summer. *Cf. * **'निदाघ** **उष्णोपगम उष्ण ऊष्मागमस्तपः' इत्यमरः। अत्ययः—(अति+√इण्+अच्)** disappearance. **नवैः—नूतनैः** fresh *i. e*. the first waters of rainy season. **उक्षिता—(√उक्ष्+क्तः+आ) सिक्ता** drenched. **भुवा सह—**with the earth.

Just as vapour comes out of the earth when drenched with the fresh showers of the rainy season, so did it arise from the body of Parvati which had been heated by the five fires. This shows that her body was heated very much, so much so that it turned water into vapour. 23.

** NOTES:—प्रथमोदबिन्दवः—प्रथमे (नवाः) उदकस्य (जलस्य) बिन्दवः (कणाः) प्रथमोबिन्दवः** drops of first water. **उदक** is optionally changed to **उद** when followed by **मन्थ, ओदन,** **सक्तु, बिन्दु** etc. *C.f.* **'मन्थौदनसक्तुबिन्दुवज्रभारहारवीवधगाहेषु च' पा० ६.३. ६० । पक्ष्मसु—नेत्रलोमसु** at the eyelashes. **पक्ष्मन्** is declined as **पक्ष्म, पक्ष्मणी, पक्ष्माणि** etc. **स्थिताः—**rested. This shows that her eyelashes were dense, which is a sign of beauty, and the adverb **क्षणं** indicates that they were also smooth. **ताडिताधराः—ताडितः अधरो यैस्ते** which struck against the flower lip. **पयोधरोत्सेधनिपातचूर्णिताः। उत्सेधः—(उत्—√सिधू** to go+**घञ्) उन्नतिः** height, elevation; bigness; protrusion. **पयोधरयोः (स्तनयोः) उत्सेधे (उन्नतप्रदेशे) निपातेन चूर्णिताः** broken on account of their falling on the elevation of her breasts. This indicates that her breasts were quite elevated and hard. **वलीषु—उदरस्थितासु रेखासु** at the folds or wrinkles. **स्खलिताः—निरुध्य पतिताः** stumbling through. **नाभिं—**navel. **चिरेण—विलम्बेन** after a long delay. It is an indeclinable word and not the Instrumental Sing. The drops reached her navel after a long delay, because they had to meet with so many obstructions in the way. **प्रपेदिरे—(प्र+पद्** to go**+लिट्) प्राप्ताः** reached. Conjugate as—**पद्यते (लट्) अपद्यत (लङ्) पत्स्यते (लृट्)** **अपादि (लुङ्)** etc. In this shloka the poet has described the natural path of the drops of rainy showers that fell on Parvati when she sat in the open. By the way it has given him an occasion to suggest the excellence of the various limbs of Parvati.

 This verse is a good example of **परिकर अलङ्कार,** 'in



which many significant epithets or adjectives are employed one after the other to give force to a statement, *Cf. * **'उक्तैः विशेषणैः साभिप्रायैः परिकरो मतः। साहित्यदर्पणम्।**

It is Accusative plural and adj. of **रात्रीः। सहस्यरात्रीः—सहस्यस्य (पौषमासस्य) रात्रीः** the nights of Pausha. Here it stands for cold season**. 'पौषे तिष्यसहस्यौ द्वौ' इत्यमरः। उदवासतत्परा—उदके वासः, तत्र तत्परः (स परो यस्याः सा तत्परा)** given to standing in water; eagerly engaged in standing in water. **उदक** is replaced by **उद** before **पेषं, वास** etc. **'पेषंवासवाहनाधिषु च' पा० ६.३.५७ ।** Similarly is formed **उदधिः** (ocean). Standing in water forms an important part of penance in cold season. **पुरः—** in her front **वियुक्ते—(वि+√युज्+क्तः) विरहिते** separated, **परस्पराक्रन्दिनि। परस्परं** is a Reciprocal Pronoun formed by the rule **'कर्मव्यतिहारे सर्वनाम्नो द्वे वाच्ये'** *ⅰ.e.*, the pronouns **अन्य, पर**, **इतर** and **उत्तर** are doubled when reciprocity of action is expressed, and **स्** replaces the case of the first part of **अन्य** and **पर** and does not disappear in a compound.These are generally, used in the singular and also adverbially. **परस्परम्** **आक्रन्दतीति परस्पराक्रन्दि, तस्मिन् (आ+√क्रन्द्+णिनिः)** crying for each other. **चक्रवाकयोः—चक्रवाकी च चक्रवाकश्च चक्रवाकौ, तयोः** of Chakarvakas. **चक्रवाकयोः** means the couple of Chakravakas *i. e.* male and female both.

**+ङीप्) दयावती** possessed of mercy. The **म** of the termination **मतुप्** is changed to **व** when affixed to words ending in **म्** or **अ,** short or long, or having either for their penultimate. **निनाय—(√नी+लिट्) यापयामास** passed. Its object is **रात्रीः।**

 Having described how did Parvati practise penance in the hot and the rainy seasons, in this and the following verse the poet describes the way in which Parvati practised penance in the cold season. 26.

** NOTES:—पद्म सुगन्धिना—शोभना गन्धो यस्मिंस्तत् सुगन्धि (सुरभि)** fragrant. गन्ध becomes **गन्धि** in a Bahuvrihi compound when preceded by **उतू, पूति** and **सु** **'गन्धस्येदुत्पूतिसुसुरभिभ्यः' पा० ५.४.१३५ । पद्मेन इव सुगन्धिना पद्मसुगन्धिना** which was as fragrant as the lotus. **प्रवेपमानाधरपत्रशोभिना। प्रवेपमानः—(प्र+√वेप्+शानच्) प्रकम्पमानः** trembling. **अधरपत्रं—अधरः एव पत्रं** leaf-like nether lip. **पत्र** means a petal of lotus. **प्रवेपमानेन अधरपत्रेण शोभते इति प्रवेपमानाधरपत्रशोभि (√सुभ् दीप्तो+णिनिः) तेन** which shone with the quivering leaf of the nether lip. The whole face being compared to a lotus, the lips may rightly be compared to its petals. **तुषारवृष्टिक्षतपद्मसंपदां—तुषारस्य (तुहिनस्य—हिमस्य) वृष्ट्या क्षताः (नाशिताः)**



**पद्मान्येव सम्पदोयासां ताः, तासां** the wealth of lotuses of which was destroyed by the showers of frost. The comp. is an adj. of **अपां—**waters. The word **आप्** is declined only in plural and in feminine gender. **आपः। अपः। अद्भिः।अद्भ्यः। अद्भ्यः। अपाम्। अप्सु।** * Cf.* **'आपः सुमनसोवर्षाः अप्सराः सिकताः समाः। एते स्त्रियां बहुत्वे स्युरेकत्वेप्युत्तरत्रयम्।' सरोजसन्धानम्। सरोजं=सरसि जातम् (√जन्+डः)**a lotus. **सरोजानां सन्धानं। (संघट्टनं) सरोजसन्धानं** continuation (of the line) of lotuses. The lotuses of the water being withered by frost, her lotus-like face being reflected in the water served as a substitute for them. Some books read **संतानं** for **संघानम्। इव** is used for **उत्प्रेक्षालंकार॥२७॥**

**द्रुमाणां पर्णान्येव (पत्राण्येव ) वृत्तिः यस्मिन् तस्य भावः स्वयंविशीर्णद्रुमपर्णवृत्तिता** subsistence on leaves of trees fallen of their own accord. To avoid injury to trees, an ascetic would not pluck their leaves. **परा—उत्तमा, चरमा** the highest, extreme **काष्ठा—सीमा** limit. **'काष्ठा उत्कर्षे स्थितौ दिशि' इत्मरः।** The expression means 'the extreme limit' or 'the sternest severity' *i. e.*, beyond which there is no other severity. **अपाकीर्णम्—(अप+आ+√ कॄ+क्तः) त्यक्तम्** abandoned. The ordinary meaning of **√कॄ** is 'to scatter'; **कीर्ण** is formed like **शीर्णं** above. **पुराविदः—(√विद्×क्विप्) पुरा (वृत्तम्) विदन्ति (जानन्ति) इति पुराविदः** who know history, *i. e.* historians. **पुराविद्** is declined like **भूभृत्** viz., **पुराविद्,** **पुराविदौ, पुराविदः etc. प्रियंवदां—(प्रिय+√विद्+खच्) प्रियं (मधुरं) वदतीति प्रियंवदा तां प्रियंवदाम्** talking sweet. **खच्** termination is affixed to **√वद्**a by **'प्रियवशे वदः खच्' पा० ३.२-३८ ।** and a nasal **(मुम्)** is inserted before the root by '**अरुर्द्विषदजन्तस्य मुम्' पा० ६.३०.६७ ।** Although bearing so much hardship, Parvati did not lose her habit of sweet-speaking. **अपर्णा—न पर्णानि यस्याः सा अपर्णा** Aparna *i. e.*, who had given up even eating of leaves of trees. Although not without significance it is a proper name of Parvati. **'अपर्णा पार्वती दुर्गा मृडानी चण्डिकाम्बिका' इत्यमरः।** *Cf.* **'चतुर्थे त्यक्तपर्णा च अपर्णाख्यामवाप सा' शिवपुराणम् ॥२८॥**

It is an adverb to **अधश्चकार—तिरश्चकार** made low *i. e.,* excelled or surpassed. Even with her delicate frame Parvati performed such penances as were very much superior to those practised by other ascetics possessed of hard bodies. 29.

 After the 29th shloka some books have the following verse, but Mallinatha regards it as an interpolated one and has not commented on it.

 'सुराः समुद्वीक्ष्य नगेन्द्रकन्यया कृतं तपः शंभुवशक्रियाक्षमम्। ययाचिरे तं प्रणिपत्य दुःखिताः पतिं चमूनां सुतमाजिहेतुम्॥'

 But the 27th shloka of the VI canto, which runs as following, and which is a speech of Shiva refers to this sort of request made by gods to Shiva.

'सोऽहं तृष्णातुरैर्वृष्टिं विद्युत्वानिवचातकैः।

** NOTES:—अथ—तदनन्तरम्,** after this, *i. e.,* when Parvati had been successful in performing such penance as was far superior to that of other ascetics. **अथ** is used to introduce a new topic. **'मङ्गलानन्तरारम्भप्रश्नकार्त्स्न्येष्वथो अथ' इत्यमरः। अजिनाषाढधरः। अजिनंकृष्णमृगचर्म** a black antelope's skin. **'अजिनं कृत्तिः चर्म' इत्यमरः। आषाढः—(अषाढः+अण्) पालाशदण्डः** a staff of Palasha tree. **'पालाशो दण्ड आषाढः' इत्यमरः।** It is so called because it is carried by an ascetic during certain religious observances in the month of **अषाढ।** The suffix **अण** is added by**'विशाखाषाढादण् मन्थदण्डयोः' पा० ५. १. १००.** **धरः—(√धृ+अच्)** wearing or putting on. **अजिनं च आषाढश्च अजिनाषाढौ, तयोर्धरः अजिनाषाढधरः** wearing a black antelope's skin and holding a staff of Palasha. This person who came to the hermitage of Parvati was none but Shiva himself. To avoid cognizance he had come disguised as a Brahmana ascetic belonging to Brahmacharyashrama. **अजिन** and **पलाशदण्ड** are prescribed for the use of Brahmana ascetics. *Cf.* **'हारिणमैणेयं वा कार्ष्णं वा ब्राह्मणस्य' आपस्तम्बः। 'ब्राह्मणो बैल्वपालाशौ' मनु०। प्रगल्भवाक्प्रगल्भा वाग् यस्य सः** speaking confidently or proudly. Here it is used in good sense, hence, eloquent in speech or who could speak well. **ब्रह्ममयेन—(ब्रह्म+मयट्) ब्रह्मण आगतम्** formed or consisting of or identified with



Brahma. Belonging to or fit for a Brahmana. Here **ब्रह्म** means the Veda or simply Brahma. **मयट्** is added by **'मयट् च' पा० ४.३.८२ ।** Generally **मयट्** is added in the sense of ‘consisting of' but, here, it means 'coming from.' **तेजसा—कान्त्या** by the lustre **ब्रह्ममयेन तेजसा—ब्रह्मवर्चसेन** divine glory or splendour; pre eminence in holiness or sacred knowledge; superhuman power. The power and glory of Brahma; the glory supposed to surround a Brahmana. **ज्वलन् इव-दीप्यमान इव** as if burning with. **जटिलः—(जटा+इलच) जटाः सन्ति अस्य इति जटिलः**putting on matted hair. This is also a mark of a Brahmacharin, *Cf.* **'मुण्डो वा जटिलो वा स्यादथ वा स्याच्छिखाधरः' मनु०। शरीरबद्धः—शरीरेण बद्धः शरीरबद्धः,** or, **शरीरं बद्धं यस्य स शरीरबद्धः(मूर्तिमान्)** in bodily form. **बद्ध** may be used either as first or the second member of a Bahuvrihi compound. **'वाहिताग्न्यादिषु' पा० २.३.३७ ।** The other form shall be **बद्धशरीरः। प्रथमाश्रमः—प्रथमश्चासौ** **आश्रमः प्रथमाश्रमः (ब्रह्मचर्याश्रमः)** the first stage of life. The four stages of life according to scriptures are **ब्रह्मचर्य, गृहस्थ, वानप्रस्थ** and **संन्यास। यथा—इव** like **तपोवनम्—तपसः वनम्** the penance-forest. **विवेश—(√विश्+लिट् )** entered.

 For the contents of verse, *Cf*. 'तपोविपाककाले तां जिज्ञासुर्भगवान् शिवः। ब्रह्मचर्यव्रतधरो विवेश तपसोऽवलम्। अजिनाषाढधारी च प्रगल्भवचनो मुने। ज्वलन्निव जटाधारी ब्रह्मज्ञा ब्रह्मतेजसा'॥शिवपुराणम्॥३०॥

** NOTES:—आतिथेयी—**

**(अतिथि+एय (ढञ)+ई अतिथिषु साध्वी इति (अतिथिसत्कारचतुरा)** attentive to guests, hospitable. The suffix **ढञ्** is added by **सतिस्वपतेर्ढञ्' पा० ४.४.१०४ ।** and then **ङीप्** is added to make it feminine by **टिड्ढाणञ्द्वयसच्' पा० ४.१.१५ ।** The masc. form is **आतिथेयः। बहुमानपूर्वया—बहुः मानः (सत्कारः) पूर्वो यस्याः सा, तया** **बहुमानपूर्वया** which was preceded or accompanied by great reverence. **सपर्ययापूजया** worship, homage. **पूजा नमस्या अपचितिः सपर्या अर्चा अर्हणासमाः' इत्यमरः। प्रत्युदियाय—(प्रति+√उत्+इ+लिट् ) प्रत्युज्जगाम** went forth to receive (him). **√इ** to go, is conjugated as**—एति (लट्), एष्यति (ऌट्), इयाय (ऌट्) अगात् (लुङ)** etc. **साम्ये—**

**(सम+ष्यञ् समस्य भावः साम्यं, तस्मिन् (समतायाम्** towards equality. **निविष्टचेतसां—(नि+√विश्+क्तः) निविष्टं चेतो येषां ते, तेषां** whose mind is intent upon or turned to (equality). The expression'**साम्येऽपि निविष्टचेतसां'** can be construed in two ways, viz, **साम्ये निविष्टचेतसां अपि** *i. e*. even in case of those whose minds are set on equality—who look at all people with the same mind without feeling affection for one and apathy for another, or who are free from likes **(राग)** and dislikes **(द्वेष);** secondly **साम्येऽपि निविष्टचेतसां क्रियाः**......*i. e*. even when there is equality, the acts of those who are firm-minded...... In the former case **निविष्टचेतसां** is to be taken with **साम्ये** while in the latter it has nothing to do with **साम्ये,** but is connected with the following words. Then the position off **अपि** is also responsible for change of meaning. In



the former it is read with **निविष्टचेतसां** and in the latter with **साम्ये। वपुर्विशेषेषु—वपुष्षु****(शरीरेषु (विशेषा इति वपुर्विशेषाः,तेषु—असामान्यशरीरेषु** towards great personages. Here **वपु** 'a body', means one possessed of a body **वपुष्मान्)** *i. e*, a person.' Decline **वपुष्** as**—वपुः, वपुषी वपूंषि** etc. **अति गौरवाः—(गुरु+अण्) गुरोः भावः गौरवं (आदरः) अति गौरवं यासु ताः** full of extreme reverence. **क्रियाः**—acts; behaviour. The sense is that even those persons who are free from likes and dislikes show greater respect towards great personages. For a similar idea *Cf.* **'आकृतिविशेषेष्वादरः पदं करोति' मालविकाग्निमित्रम्।** 31.

It is an indeclinable used in various senses. Here it has been used in the sense of 'apparently, *i. e.*, although not really fatigued he showed that he took rest.

** NOTES:—अपि—कच्चित्** It is used here in the sense of interrogation. For its various senses *Cf.* **'गर्हासमुच्चयप्रश्नशङ्कासंभावनासु अपि'इत्यमरः। क्रियार्थं—क्रियायै इदं क्रियार्थं (होमादिकर्मकरणार्थम्)** for performing holy rites. In **क्रियार्थं** the compound is **नित्यसमास,** which is defined as **'अविग्रहो नित्यसमासः अस्वपद‌विग्रहो वा'** *i. e*., Nityasamasa is that which either cannot be expounded or cannot be expounded by using the words actually compounded. Here **क्रियार्थं** is expounded by using **क्रिया** and **इद** and not **क्रिया** and **अर्थ** which (latter) are actually compounded. The compound with **अर्थ** is a Nityasamasa and takes the gender and number of the noun it qualifies. **समित्कुशम्—समिधश्च कुशाश्च समित्कुशम्** Sacrificial sticks and Kusha grass. It is a Dwandwa compound and the singular is used by the rule **'जातिरप्राणिनाम्' पा० २.४.६ ।** *ⅰ. e.*, of words expressing things and not animals when the species is prominently referred to the compound is in



singular. **सुलभम्—(सु+√लभ्+खल्)** easy to obtain. The suffix **खल्** is added by'**ईषद्दुःसुषु कृच्छ्राकृच्छार्थेषु खल्' पा० ३.३.१२६ ।** *i. e* **खल्** is added to any root with **ईषत्, दुर्** or **सु** prefixed to it when the idea of ease or difficulty is present, e. g., **सुकरः,** **दुष्करः।** **स्नानविधिक्षमाणि—स्नानस्य विधये क्षमाणि (योग्यानि) स्नानविधिक्षमाणि** suitable for bathing. **स्वशक्त्या—स्वसामर्थ्यानुसारेण** according to your might.**खलु**—verily. **आद्यम्—प्रथमं** the chief. **धर्मसाधनम्—धर्मस्य साधनम्** means of performing the religious duties. **'शरीरमाद्यं खलु धर्मसाधनम्'** is a well-known proverbial saying and it means that body is the chief means of performing the religious duties, hence one should take greatest possible care of it.

** CHANGE OF VOICE:—**अपि क्रियार्थं समित्कुशेन सुलभेन (भूयते)? अपि जलैः ते स्नानविधिक्षमैः (भूयते)? अपि (त्वया) स्वशक्त्या तपसि प्रवृत्यते? खलु शरीरेण आद्येन धर्मसाधनेन (भूयते)॥३३॥

** ENGLISH TRANSLATION:—**'Are sacrificial sticks and Kusha grass easily available for holy rites? Is the water suitable for thy bathing? And, dost thou practise austerities in accordance with thy strength? For, the body is the chief means of performing religious duties.' 33.

**वीरुधाम्—लतानाम्** of creepers. The word **वीरुध्(वि+√रुह्+क्विप्)** is formed by changing the **ह्** of **√रुह** to **ध्** and lengthening **वि** irregularly. It is feminine and is declined as **वीरुत्,** **वीरुधौ, वीरुधः। वीरुधं, वीरुधौ, वीरुधः।** etc. For meaning *Cf.* **'लता प्रतानिनी वीरुद्' इत्यमरः।** **प्रवालं—नूतनपल्लवं** fresh or young leaves. Singular is used for the class. **'प्रवालो विद्रुमे** **वीणादण्डेऽभिनवपल्लवे' इत्यमरः। अनुवन्धि—(अनुबन्ध+इनिः) अविच्छिन्नं** continuous *i. e.*, coming out without a break. **'सम्बन्धे संततासक्तावनुबन्धः प्रकीर्तितः' इति भोजः।** Being an adjective of **प्रवालं** it is neuter gender and will be declined as **अनुबन्धि, अनुबन्धिनी अनुबन्धीनि** etc. The suffix **इनिः** is added by **'अत** **इनिठनौ' पा० ५. २. ११५ ।** After it **अस्ति** is understood. **चिरोज्झितालक्तकपाटलेन। अलक्तक—लाक्षारसः** red lac; lac dye. **चिराद् उज्झितः अलक्तको येन (बहुव्रीहिः) तथाभूतमपि पाटलम्** **(रक्तं), तेन** red though long bereft of lac dye. Adjective of **दन्तवाससा—दन्तानां वासः, तेन (अधरेण)** covering for the teeth *i. e*. lip. In **दन्तवाससा** the Instrumental is against the rul '**तुल्यार्थैरतुलोपमाभ्यां तृतीयान्यतरस्याम् पा०' २.३.७५ ।** which means that in the case of words denoting equality or likeness, such as **तुल्य सदृश** etc., the person or thing with whom or which any object is compared is put in the Genitive or Instrumental case, except in the case of **तुला** and **उपमा** (with which only the Genitive case is used). But Mallinatha defends this by saying that here the word **तुला** is **सादृश्य** (noun) **वाची** and not **सादृश्य** (adjective) **वाची** The rule prohibits the use of the Instrumental only when the word **तुला** is **सदृशवाची,** hence it could be used here. *Cf.* **'अत्र तुलाशब्दस्य......**



**ग्रहणादिति,'** the last three lines of Mallinatha's commentary. Another annotator of the rule also has expressed the same view—'**अतुलोपमाभ्याम्' इति तुला शब्दयोगे तृतीयानिषेधस्तु सदृशार्थकतुलाशब्दयोगे एव, इह तुलाशब्दः सादृश्यवाचीति न प्रर्वतत" इति।** Bhoja also takes the same view. *Cf.* **'सदृशपदार्थवाची सादृश्यमात्रवाची चेति द्वौ तुलाशब्दौ। सादृश्यमात्रवाचकतुलाशब्द‌योगे तु तृतीयाऽपीष्यत एव।'** Some commentators defend this by supplying **सह** after **दन्तवाससा। तुला—साम्यम्** equality, similarity. **आरोहति—प्राप्नोति** becomes; rises up to.

 As Parvati was very fond of small plants, which she loved like her sons, the enquiry into their wellbeing is quite appropriate. 34.

** NOTES:—महीधरः—मह्याः (भूमेः) धरः महीधरः** mountain. **धरः** **(धरतीति)** is formed from**√धृ** 'to support' by adding **कः**by **'इगुपधज्ञाप्रीकिरः' पा० ३.१.१३५ ।** *i. e.*, the roots having **इ, ई, उ, ऊ, ऋ, ॠ, लृ,** or **ॡ** for their penultimate and **ज्ञा, प्री** and **कॄ** take **क** in active voice. **विकीर्ण सप्तर्षिबलिप्रहासिभिः विकीर्णः—(वि√कॄ+क्तः) पर्यस्तः** scattered. See notes on **विशीर्ण** in the Verse 28 above. **सप्तर्षयः—सप्त च ते ऋषयश्च सप्तर्षयः** the seven Rishis. The compound is Karmadharaya, by **'दिक्संख्ये संज्ञायाम्' पा० २.१.६१ ।**meaning that names of quarters and numerals form a Karmadharaya compound with any declinable word, but only when the whole compound is an appellation **(संज्ञा),** Here it is the proper name of a constellation of seven stars (Ursa Major), named after seven sages. Their names Their names are—**1. मरीचि 2. अङ्गिरस् 3. अत्रि 4. पुलस्त्य
5. पुलह** **6.क्रतु** and **7. वशिष्ठ।**They reside in heaven and are often described as taking bath and offering flowers to the gods in the holy waters of the heavenly Ganges. *Cf*. **'अत्राभिषेकाय तपोधनानां सप्तर्षिहस्तोद्धृतहेमपद्माम्। प्रवर्तया-**



**मास किनानुसूया त्रिस्रातसं त्रयम्बकमौलिमालाम्।' रघुवंशम् १३.५१ ।बलिः—पुष्पोपहारः** an offering (of flowers **'करोपहारयोः पुंसि बलिः' इत्यमरः। प्रहासिभिः (प्र+√हस्+णिनिः) प्रहसन्तीति** *i.e.,* shining; resplendent. The flowers of offerings on account of their white colour are poetically regarded as the smiles of the waters of the Ganges. Some books read **प्रभासिभिः** and some others **प्रवाहिभिः** in place of **प्रहासिभिः।** The former will mean 'resplendent' and the latter 'carrying.' **विकीर्ण... प्रहासिभिः—विकीर्णैः सप्तर्षीणां** **बलिभिः प्रहसन्तीति विकीर्णसप्तर्षिबलिप्रहासीनि, तैः** which are resplendent (lit. laughing) with the offerings of flowers scattered by the seven sages. **दिवः—स्वर्गात्** from the heaven. Ablative is used in the sense of **अपादान** (separation). The waters of the holy Ganges are described in mythological books as falling from the heaven. **च्युतैः** **(√च्यु +क्तः) पतितैः** dropped. The two adjectives**—विकीर्णसप्तर्षिबलिप्रहासिभिः** and **दिवश्च्युतैः** are meant to indicate the holy character of the waters of the Ganges. This makes the contrast more effective **गाङ्गैः**—**(गङ्गा+अण) गङ्गायाः इमानि गाङ्गानि‚ तैः** of the Ganges. **तथा—तेन प्रकारेण** in that way; so much. **पावितः—(√पू** to purify**+क्तः)** Passive Past Participle **पवित्रीकृतः** sanctified. **अनाविलैः—न आविलैःअनाविलैः** not dirty; pure. Adjective of **त्वदीयैः चरितैः.** It implies that Parvati's conduct is purer and more sanctifying than the waters of the Ganges. The suggested figure of speech is **व्यतिरेक,** in which the standard of comparison is excelled by the thing compared. **त्वदीयैः**—**(युष्मद्+छः—ईय्) तव इमानि त्वदीयानि, तैः** by your own. The suffix **छः** is added to **युष्मद्** by **'वृद्धाच्छः'**



**पा० ४.२.११४ ।** and **युष्म** of **युष्मद्** is changed to **त्वं** by **'प्रत्ययात्तरप‌दयोश्च' पा० ७.२.६८ । चरितैः**—acts. **सान्वयः—अन्वयेन (कुटुम्बेन) सह इति सान्वयः** with his family. This verse contains a glowing tribute from Shiva for the righteous life of Parvati 37.

'a word' and 'a footstep', so the expression means 'which is formed by uttering seven words' or 'by walking over seven steps together' *i. e.*, friendship. The word has lost the literal sense and is used for friendship. It is irregularly formed to indicate this meaning by **'साप्तपदीनं सख्यम्' पा० ५.२.२२ । 'सख्यं साप्तपदीनं स्यात्' इत्यमरः।** *Cf*. **'संबन्धमाभाषणपूर्वमाहुः' रघु० २.५८ ।** and **'सतां सप्तपदा मैत्री, सत्सतां त्रिपदा स्मृता। सत्सतामपि ये सन्तस्तेषां मैत्री पदे पदे।**

 Shiva means to say as Parvati and he had uttered a few words to each other they were friends and not strangers to each other, and so he was entitled to make further enquiries about her. 39.

** NOTES:—तपोधने—तप एव धनं यस्याः सा तपोधना, सम्बोधने तपोधने,** whose treasure consists of penance. **अत्र—तपःसम्बन्धे** * i. e.*, with regard to your penance. **द्विजातिभावात्—(√जन्+क्तिन्=जातिः) द्वे जाती(जन्मनी) यस्य स द्विजातिः, तस्य भावः द्विजातिभावः, तस्मात्** on account of my being a Brahmana. **द्विजाति** means those who have two births viz., one from the mother and the other from the preceptor in the form of initiation. Hence it indicates the first three castes. *Cf.* **'मातुर्यदग्रे जायन्ते द्वितीयं मौञ्जिबन्धनात्।** **ब्राह्मणक्षत्रियविशस्तस्मादेते द्विजाः स्मृताः।' मनु० २.१६९।** But, here it means the Brahmana class alone. Ablative is used in the sense of cause. Shiva means to say that Brahmanas are inquisitive by their nature and that he was not an exception to this. **उपपन्नचापलः। उपपन्नं—(उप+√पद्+क्तः) संभाव्यं; प्राप्तम्** is produced or aroused. **चापलं—(चपल+अण्) चपलस्य भावः चापलम् (धृष्टता)** agitation, want of patience. **उपपन्नं** **चापलं यस्य स उपपन्नचापलः** *ⅰ. e.*, who has become curious. **अयं जनः—***i. e.*, I myself. **बहुक्षमां—बहुः क्षमा यस्यां सा बहुक्षमा, ताम्** or **बहु क्षाम्यतीति बहुक्षमा ताम्** One possessed of great forbearance; who forgives much; who is capable of bearing great hardships. It gives the reason why Shiva makes bold to make enquiry. **प्रष्टुमनाः—(√प्रच्छ+तुमुन्+मनाः) प्रष्टुं मनो यस्य स प्रष्टुमनाः** desirous of asking something. The nasal of the infinitive is dropped before **काम** and **मनस्** by **'तुं**



**काममनसोरपि’। रहस्यं—(रहस्+यत्) रहसि भवं रहस्यं (गोप्यं)** a secret. **प्रतिवक्तुं—(प्रति+√ वच्+तुमुन्)** to tell me. Some books read **प्रतिबोधयिष्यसि** (thou wiltkindly let me know) instead of **प्रतिवक्तुमर्हसि॥४०॥**

The suffix is added by **'अचो यत्' पा० ३. १.६७ ।** Parvati did not need hanker after any kind of wealth for her father's residence was the home of every sort of wealth. **वयः—**age. **नवं—नूतनं** fresh, *i. e.* young age. **अतः परम्—**besides this the things enumerated in the first three lines of the verse. **तपः फलं—तपसः** **फल** the fruit of penance.

 Shiva means to say that Parvati being already in possession of all those things, namely noble birth, excessive beauty, happiness of wealth and young age, for the acquisition of which people generally resort to practise penance, he failed to understand the cause of her penance and so asked the question. 41.

 **NOTES:—सुभ्रु—शोभने भ्रुवौ यस्याः सा सुभ्रू, तस्याः सम्बोधने** O thou of beautiful eye-brows. According to the author of Siddhantakaunaudi the Vocative singular of **सुभ्रू** should be **सुभ्रुः** and not **सुभ्र** as given here, because the long **ऊ** is shortened in Voc. sing. of only those words which are termed as **नदीसंज्ञक** (*i. e.*, the words of feminine gender ending in long **इ**or **ऊ)** by **'अम्बार्थनद्योर्ह्रस्वः' पा० ७.३.१०७ ।** *i. e*., the words meaning 'mother' and **नदीसंज्ञक** are shortened in the Voc. sing., and as the word **सुभ्र** is not termed as such because of the rule **'नेयङुवङ्स्थानावस्त्री' पा० १.४.४ ।** which means that the word of which **ई** or **ऊ** are replaced by **इयङ्** or **उवङ्,** with the exception of **स्त्री** are not termed as **नदी,** its **ऊ** should not have been shortened. But Mallinatha defends it by saying that according to the Bhashyakara (Patanjali) the shortening of the final vowel may he allowed in rare cases, for in his commentary on **'अप्राणिजातेश्चारज्ज्वादीनामुपसंख्यानम्'** he has given the instance **अलाबू, कर्कन्धू।** thereby indicating that sometimes **ऊकारान्त** words may take **ऊङ्**and be **नदीसंज्ञक** so that they can shorten their vowel in the Voc. sing. Vamana also supports this view by saying **'ऊकारान्तादप्यूङ्प्रवृत्तेः.'** Thus **ऊङ्** will be added to **सुभ्रू** and then its **ऊ** not being replaced by **उवङ्** it will be termed as **नदी,** which means it will be shortened in Voc. sing. Other poets also have used it in short **उ**, for instance *Cf.* **'सुभ्रु त्वं कुपितेत्य** **पास्तमशनं०'** quoted by Mallinatha. **इयं—**this, *i. e*., yours.



**अलभ्यशोकाभिभवा—(√लभ्+यत्) न लभ्यौ शोकश्च अभिभवश्च (तिरस्कारश्च) यया सा अलभ्यशोकाभिभवा** which is incapable of grief and humiliation. Or, **न लभ्यः शोकेन अभिभवो यया सा** which is incapable of the humiliation of grief. It is a supposition that beautiful persons cannot be subject to misery. **विमानना—(√मान्+युच्) अपमानः** insult; disrespectful treatment. In **कुतः (किम्+तसिल्) किम्** is changed to **कु** by **'कु तिहोः पा० ७.२.१४ । पराभिमर्शः—(√मृश्** to touch**+घञ्) परेण अभिमर्शः पराभिमर्शः** being touched or outraged by others. **पन्नगरत्नसूचये। पन्नगः—(पन्न+√गम्+डः) पन्नं गच्छतीति पन्नगः (सर्पः)** creeping low, *i. e*, a serpent. **रत्नस्य सुचिः रत्नसूचिः** (the sharp point of the gem); **पन्नगस्य** **रत्नसूचिः पन्नगरत्नसूचिः, तस्यै पन्नगरत्नसूचये ( सर्पमणिशलाकामादातुं )** the sharp point of the serpent's gem, *i. e.*, in order to catch it by its end. The Dative in **सूचये** is used because of **'क्रियार्थोपपदस्य कर्मणि स्थानिनः' पा० २.३.१४ ।** *i. e.*, the object governed by an infinitive mood not actually used but implied, is put in the Dative. Thus **सूचये** means **सूचिं ग्रहीतुम्। करं—हस्तं** an arm **प्रसारयेत्—(प्र+√सृ+णिच्+लिङ्)** may extend or stretch out. As it is not possible to catch hold of the gem of a serpent's hood, so it was impossible for any one to threaten the person of Parvati. 43.

** CHANGE OF VOICE:—**(हे) सुभ्रु, अनया आकृत्या अलभ्यशोकाभिभवया (भूयते), पितुः गृहे विमाननया कुतः (भूयते), तव पराभिमर्शेण न भूयते, केन पन्नगरत्नसूचये करः प्रसार्य्येत?॥४३॥

** ENGLISH TRANSLATION:—**O one of beautiful eye-brows, this (thy) form is incapable of the humiliation of grief; and whence can there be any disrespectful treatment at the father's house? Nor can there be any insult from others; (for) who can stretch his arm for (snatching away) the pointed end of a serpent's gem? 43.

** NOTES:—यौवने—(युवन्+अण्) यूनो भावः यौवनम्, तस्मिन्** in young age. **अपास्य—(अप+√अस्** to throw **+ल्यप्) त्यक्त्वा** having cast. **वार्द्धकशोभि। वार्द्धकम्—(वृद्ध+वुञ्—अक्) वृद्धस्य भावः वार्द्धकम्** old age. The suffix **वुञ्—**which is replaced by **अक** is added by **'द्वन्द्वमनोज्ञादिभ्यश्च' पा० ५.१.१३३ । वार्द्धके शोभते इति वार्द्धकशोमि (√शुभ्** to shine **+णिनिः)** which looks good in old age; suitable in old age. Adj. of **वल्कलम्—**a bark garment, which is generally put on by ascetics. **स्फुटचन्द्रतारका—स्फुटाः (प्रकाशमानाः) चन्द्रः तारकाश्च यस्यां सा स्फुटचन्द्रतारका** in which the moon and the stars are shining. **विभावरी—(वि+√भा** to shine **+वनिप्+ङीप्) विभाति इति विभावरी, रात्रिः** night. **'विभावरीतमस्विन्यौ रजनी नामिनी तमी' इत्यमरः।** The suffix **ङीप्** is added to make it fem. by **'वनो र च' पा० ४.१.७ ।** which is also responsible for changing the **न** of **वनिप्** into **र।** **प्रदोषे—रात्रिमुखे; रात्रेः पूर्वभागे** during the first part of night, (*i. e*., when the night is in its youth). **'प्रदोषोरजनीमुखम्' इत्यमरः। अरुणाय—**for the dawn, **अरुण** is described as the son of **कश्यप** and **विनता** and the elder brother of **गरुड।** He has no thighs and so is known as **अनृरु।** He is also personified as the charioteer of the sun. Note that **अरुण** also means 'red' hence



the red colour which pervades the sky before the sunrise. This gives it the title of ‘the harbinger’ of 'the dawn.' In **अरुणाय** the Dative is used because the sense of infinitive is understood **अरुणाय—अरुणं गन्तुं; अरुणोदयं कर्त्तुम्।** *Cf*. **'क्रियार्थोपपदस्य च०'** quoted in the notes on **पन्नगरत्नसूचये** in the 43rd verse above. **कल्पते—प्रभवति** to be able or fit for.

 Shiva means to say as the night in its youth can not think of the dawn, so Parvati also should not have thought of putting on bark garments in her youth. The connection between the moon and the stars and Aruna on one hand and the ornaments and bark garment on the other is made all the more effective when their respective lustre and colour are taken into consideration. Ornaments glitter like the moon and the stars, while bark is of the same colour as the dawn. 44.

** NOTES:—दिवं—स्वर्गं** heaven. **प्रार्थयसे—अभिलषसि** seek. **श्रमः—**effort; penance, **'अभ्यासे शस्त्रविद्यादौ वेदे तपसि च**



**श्रमः, इति भोजः। पितुः—जनकस्य** *ⅰ. e.*, of the Himalaya. **देवभूमयः—देवानां भूमयः देवभूमयः** the land of gods, *i. e*., where the gods live. So, when the regions of your father are the land of gods it is no use trying to seek heaven. **उपयन्तारं—(उप+√यम्+तृच्) वरं** husband. **√यम्** to restrain, when preceded by **उप** means 'to marry.'**समाधिना—तपसा** austerities. Instrumental is used with **अलम्,** when it means 'enough of' **अलं—न कर्त्तव्यमित्यर्थः** *i. e.*, do not practise it **न अन्विष्यति—न मृगयते** does not seek. **रत्नं** is the subject of **अन्विष्यति** and its object **ग्राहकं** (a customer) is understood. Similarly in the clause **तद् मृग्यते, तद्** (a jewel) is the object and the subject **ग्राहकैः** (by the customers) is understood. **मृग्यते—अन्विष्यते** is sought for. Passive voice present tense of **√मृग्** to seek. The expression **'न रत्नमन्विष्यति मृग्यते हि तत्'** is a general statement which means that it is not the business of jewels or other valuable things to find out customers for themselves, but they are sought for by customers. So Shiva means to say that Parvati being possessed of extreme beauty and other virtues she did not need practise any penance to procure a suitable husbaud. 45.

** CHANGE OF VOICE:—**यदि (त्वया) द्यौः प्रार्थ्यते तर्हि श्रमेण वृथा (भूयते), (यतः) तव पितुः प्रदेशैः देवभूमिभिः (भूयते); अथ उपयन्ता (प्रार्थ्यते तर्हि) समाधिना अलम्, रत्नेन (ग्रहीता) न अन्वेष्यते हि (ग्रहीता) तत् मृगयते॥४५॥

** ENGLISH TRANSLATION:—**If thou art seeking heaven the effort is in vain, (since) the regions of thy father are the land of gods. And if thou dost seek a husband, cease from this penance; (for) a jewel has not to seek, but it is sought after. 45.

** NOTES:—**On hearing the word husband, Parvati instead of replying to the question simply heaved a sigh, which led Shiva to conclude that she was practising penance in order to procure a suitable husband. But the conclusion was not without doubt, so he continues his enquiry. **सोष्मणा—ऊष्मणा सह वर्तत इति सोष्म, तेन सोष्मणा (उष्णेन)** warm. **ऊष्मन्** (heat) masc. gender is declined as**—ऊष्मा, ऊष्माणौ, ऊष्माणः। ऊष्माणं, ऊष्माणौ, ऊष्मणः। ऊष्मणा, ऊष्मभ्यां, ऊष्मभिः** etc. **निःश्वसितेन—(निस्+√श्वस्+क्तः) निःश्वासेन** sigh; breathing. **निःश्वसितं** also means 'breathing out'; and its opposite is **उच्छ्वसितं** **'**drawing in deep breath.**' निवेदितम्—सूचितम्** indicated. **गाहते—प्राप्नोति** plunges into. The root is **√गाह्**to dive into. **प्रार्थयितव्य—(प्र+अर्थ+णिच्+तव्य) प्रार्थयितुमर्हः** to be sought after; to be requested. **ते—तव** of thee. In the case of Potential passive participles the agent of the action is put in the genitive or in the Instrumental case. *Cf*. **'कृत्यानां कर्त्तरि वा' पा० २.३.७१ । प्रार्थितदुर्लभः—प्रार्थितश्चासौ दुर्लभश्च प्रार्थितदुर्लभः** unavailable when sought for. Shiva means—you need not seek the husband, the husband must seek you; and if you seek after him it should not be difficult to obtain him. 46.

** CHANGE OF VOICE:—**(यद्यपि) सोष्म निःश्वसितं निवेदितवत्, मे मनसा तु संशय एवगाह्यते, ते प्रार्थयितव्यं एव (अहं) न पश्यामि, प्रार्थितदुर्लभेन कथं भविष्यते॥४६॥

** NOTES:—ईप्सितः—(√आप्** to obtain **+सन्+क्तः) प्राप्तुं काङ्क्ष्यमाणः** Desired to be obtained. This is Past Passive Participle, used in the sense of the present tense, of the Desiderative of **√आप्। आ** of **√आप्** is changed to **ई** before **सन्** suffix by **'आप् ज्ञप्यृधामीत्' पा० ७.४.५५ ।**In **तव,** Genitive case is used because the past passive participle has been used in the sense of the present tense.

At times flowers are used particularly by women living in hermitages, as ornaments. Parvati also did so, but since her assuming the life of an ascetic she gave up the practice. **गते—**Loc. sing. of **गत** past part.

**लम्बिनीः, ताः** loose or untied and (or, therefore hanging. **लम्बिनीः (√लम्ब्+णिनिः+ङीप्)** is in Acc. plu. declined like **नदी।** Some books read **श्लथबन्धिनीः—श्लथः बन्धो यासां विद्यते ताः श्लथबन्धिन्यः, ताः** with their tie loosened. **कलमाग्रपिङ्गलाः—कलमानां (शालिविशेषाणां) अग्रवत् पिङ्गलाः** tawny like the tips of the blades of paddy. **कलम** is a kind of rice, known as paddy. Both these are Adjectives of **जटाः—**Matted hair. **उपेक्षते—अनादरेण सहते** tolerates; is indifferent towards. **√ईक्ष्** 'to see' when preceded by **उप** means 'to see indifferently.' Shiva means to say that the bridegroom who is sought after by her must be very hard-hearted who does not take pity on this condition of Parvati. 47.

**विभूषणं—(वि+भूष्—ल्युट्+अन) विभूषय त्यनेन इति विभूषणं** an ornament. **आस्पदं—स्थानं** a place. **दिवाकरेण आप्लुष्टानि विभूषणानां आस्पदानि यस्याः सा दिवाकराप्लुष्टविभूषणास्पदा, ताम्** the places of ornaments of whose (body) have been scorched by the sun. **दिवा—दिवसे** during the daytime.

The simile is very effective—just as the crescent of the moon is very thin and is dimmed by the light of the sun so did appear Parvati who was emaciated and sun-burnt during her observance of hard vows. **पश्यतः—अवलोकयतः** who sees you. Genitive sing. of **पश्यत्** pres. part of **√दृश्। सचेतसः—चेतसा सह वर्त्तते इति सचेताः, तस्य सचेतसः (सहृदयस्य)** possessing consciousness or heart; full of feeling. **दूयते—(√दूङ् परितापे+लट्)** suffers pain.

Adverb to **वेदितुं—ज्ञातुं** to know. Some commentators have interpreted the word **तपः** to mean body, which is a means of performing penance. They mean to say that Shiva had offered to make Parvati his own **अर्द्धांगिनी** *Cf.* **'तपः शब्दो लक्षणथा तपः साधनभूतस्य शरीरस्य बोधकः, 'शरीरमाद्यं खलु धर्मसाधनम्' इत्युक्तत्वात् ।'** But this seems to be far fetched. 50.

The **√धा** 'to put on' comes to mean 'to say' when preceded by the preposition **अभि।** Note that **धा** changes into **हि** by **'दधातेर्हि' पा० ७.४.४२ । मनोगतं—मनसि गतं मनोगतं (हृदयस्थं भावं वरं वा)** the desire or secret of her mind. **शंसितुं—(शंस्+तुमुन्) कथयितुं** to relate; to disclose. **शशाक—समर्था** **अभूत्** was able. It was evidently on account of modesty which is so natural for a high born maiden that Parvati could not frankly talk to the Brahmana. **अथो—अनन्तरं** Then. It is an indeclinable different from **अथ,** though means the same. **परिपार्श्ववर्तिनीं—(परिपार्श्व+√वृत्+णिनिः+ङीप्) परिपार्श्वे (समीपे) वर्त्तते इति परिपार्श्ववर्त्तिनीं, ताम्** who was by her side. **वयस्यां—(वयस+यत्+आ) वयसा (आयुषा) तुल्या (समा) वयस्या (सखी)** who is equal in age *i. e.*, a lady-friend.

Synonyms of **अम्भोज** may be had by adding **ज** to word meaning water. **उष्णवारणं—उष्णस्य वारणं उष्णवारणम् (क्षत्रम्)** warding off the sun; an umbrella. **तपःसाधनं—तपसः साधनं तपःसाधनं** a means of practising religious austerities. Just as people use a lotus leaf for warding off the sun so did Parvati employ her body to practise penance. 52.

Indra, Varuna, Yama and Kubera are the lords of east, west, south, and north respectively. The compound is an **उत्तरपद‌समास** by

When Shiva could not be allured by Cupid, it is quite appropriate to say that he could not be conquered by physical charme. This was the reason why Parvati wanted to win him over by the power of penance. **पिनाकपाणिम्—पिनाकः (धनुर्विशेषः) पाणौ यस्य स पिनाकपाणिः (शिवः) तं** who holds Pinaka in his hand, *i. e.*, Shiva, Pinaka is the proper name of Shiva's bow. **'पिनाकोऽस्त्री रुद्रचापे पांसुवर्षत्रिशूलयोः' इति मेदिनी।** The Locative of **पाणि** is made the second member, instead of the first, of the compound by **'प्रहरणार्थेभ्यः परे निष्ठासप्तम्यौ'** **आप्तुं—अधिगन्तुं** to obtain.

 In this and the following five verses the poet has described some of the ten states of Parvati to which she was subjected because of her attachment for Shiva. These states are known as **अनङ्गदशाः** *ⅰ.e.,* the various states of a person's mind and body when he is in love with somebody. They are—**'दृङ्मनःसङ्गसंकल्पा जागरः कृशताऽरतिः। ह्रीत्यागोन्मादमूर्च्छान्ता इत्यनङ्गदशाः दश॥'** In this



verse Parvati's सङ्कल्प *ⅰ.e*., determination to obtain Shiva has been suggested. 53.

This refers to the time when Cupid vainly tried to allure Shiva and was ultimately reduced to ashes by him. **विशीर्णमूर्त्तेः—(वि+√शृ+क्तः) विशीर्णा (नष्टा) मूर्त्तिः यस्य स विशीर्णमूर्त्तिः, तस्य विशीर्णमूर्त्तेः** whose body had been destroyed. For **विशीर्ण** see notes on this word in verse 28 above. **अपि—**still, *i.e.*, though Cupid had been physically destroyed, his arrow could still work. **पुष्पधन्वनः—(पुष्प+धनुष्+अनङ्) पुष्पाण्येव धनुर्यस्य स पुष्पधन्वा, तस्य पुष्पधन्वनः** * Cf.* the Flower-bowed; whose bow is made of flowers. It is a name of the god of love. The word **धनुष्** at the end of a Bahuvrihi compound becomes **धन्वन्** by the addition of **अनङ्** by **'धनुषश्च' पा० ५.४.१३२,** when the compound is a noun the change is optional, hence its another form is **पुष्पधनुः। शिलीमुखः—शिली (शल्यं) मुखे यस्य सः शिलीमुखः (बाणः)** an arrow. It also means 'a black bee'. **'अलिबाणौ शिलीमुखौ' इत्यमरः। असह्यहुङ्कारनिवर्तितः। असह्यं—(सह्+यत्) सोढुं योग्यं सह्यं न सह्यं असह्यं** which can not be borne. **हुङ्कारः—**



the sound hum **(हुं)** expressive of menace or contempt. According to some Humkara is the weapon of Shiva as Rudra. **असह्येन हुङ्कारेण निवर्तितः असह्यहुङ्कारनिवर्तितः** hurled back with the Humkara sound. **पुरारिं—पुराणां (दैत्यनगराणां) अरिं पुरारिम् (शिवं)** the enemy of the cities, *i.e.* Shiva. Shiva is known as **पुरारि** and **त्रिपुरारि** because he destroyed the three cities of gold, silver and iron, in the sky, the ethereal region and on earth by the demon Maya and presided over by himself, Vidyunmali and Tarakasura. **अप्राप्तमुखः—अप्राप्तं मुखं (बाणाग्रंफलकं) यस्य सः** whose point did not reach (Shiva), because it was returned on its way. **इमाम्—पार्वतीम्।** while Shiva remained invincible, Parvati fell a victim to the arrows of Cupid. **व्यायतपातम्—(वि+आ+√यम्+** **क्तः=व्यायतः। √पत्+घञ्=पातः) विशेषेण आयतः व्यायतः (अति तीव्रः दीर्घः) पातः (प्रहारः)** **यस्मिन् कर्मणि यथा भवति तथा व्यायतपातम्** with a cruel blow; so as to make a deep wound. An Adverb to **अक्षिणोत्—विव्याध** struck. Imperfect **(लङ्) ✓**of **क्षि हिंसायाम्।**

 In this verse the three states, *viz*., **दृक्सङ्ग** (attachment through eyes), **मनःसङ्ग** (attachment through mind) and **कृशता** (leanness) of Parvati have been suggested by the poet. 54.

** CHANGE OF VOICE:—**पुरा विशीर्णमूर्त्तेः अपि पुष्पधन्वनः शिलीमुखेन असह्यहुङ्कारनिवर्तितेन पुरारिं अप्राप्तमुखेन इयं हृदि व्यायतपातं अक्षीयत॥५४॥

** HINDI TRANSLATION:—**पहिले समय में नष्ट शरीर वाले भी पुष्प के धनुष वाले (कामदेव) के बाण ने, जो कि (शिव की) न सहने योग्य हुङ्कार से लौटा दिया गया था और महादेव तक

** ENGLISH TRANSLATION:—**Formerly, although his body had been destroyed, the arrow of the Flower-bowed (*i.e*., Cupid) which was hurled back with the Hunkara sound, difficult to be borne (and) whose point failed to reach the enemy of the cities (*i.e*., Shiva), struck her in the heart with a cruel blow. 54.

काचन्दनधूसरालका बाला तुषारसंघातशिलातलेषु अपि जातु निर्वृतिं न लभते स्म॥५५॥

** NOTES:—तदा प्रभृति—तत आरभ्य** since then. The indeclinable **तदा** is formed by the addition of **दा** to **तत्** when the Pronoun indicates time and is in the Locative, **तस्मिन्** **काले तदा—**by **'सर्वैकान्यकिंयत्तदः काले दा' पा० ५.३.५१ ।** Now it having the meaning of the Locative, it should not have been used with **प्रभृति,—उत् (उत्कटः) मदनः (कामः) यस्याः सा उन्मदना** which governs the Ablative case, and hence the usual form should have been **ततः प्रभृति,** But, as **प्रभृति** may also be used with adverbs of time, so the expression is not wrong. Or, according to Mallinatha the suffix **दा** may be taken to give the meaning of the Ablative. **उन्मदना** whose passion had been greatly excited. **ललाटिकाचन्दनधूसरालका। ललाटिका—(ललाट+कन्) ललाटस्य अलङ्कारो ललाटिका (तिलकः)** an ornamental mark on the forehead. This mark was of sandal-paste and was applied to alleviate the heat caused by her excessive passion. The suffix **कन्** is added by **'कर्णललाटात्कन् अलङ्कारे' पा० ४.३.६५ । धूसर**—white-yellowish. **अलकाः—चूर्णकुन्तलाः** curling tresses; a curl; lock (of hair). **ललाटिकायाश्चन्दनेन (अथवा ललाटिका** **रूपेण चन्दनेन) धूसरा अलका यस्याः सा** whose curling tresses were made white by the sandal mark on her forehead. **तुषारसंघातशिलातलेषु—तुषाराणां (हिमस्य) संघाताः (समूहाः) एव शिलाः तुषारसंघातशिलाः, तासां तलेषु तुषारसंघातशिलातलेषु** (Sitting or lying) on the surfaces of slabs made of heaped snow. Parvati used to recline on snow-slabs to alleviate the heat of her love-torment. **न जातु—कदाचित्**



**अपि न** never; not at all. **निर्वृत्तिम्—सुखम्** pleasure; happiness. **'निर्वृतिः सुखदुःखयोः‚' इत्यमरः। स्म** is added to present tense to give it the sense of the past.

 This verse suggests Parvati's **अरति** (indifference towards worldly pleasures) or **संज्वर** (fever caused by passion). 55.

** CHANGE OF VOICE:—**तदा प्रभृति पितुः गृहे उन्मदनया ललाटिकाचन्दनधूसरालकया बालया तुषारसंघातशिलातलेष्वपि जातु निर्वृतिः न लभ्यते स्म॥५५॥

** ENGLISH TRANSLATION:—** Since then the maiden, whose passion had been greatly excited, (and) whose curling tresses were whitened by the sandal applied as a mark on the forehead, never felt at ease even when reclining on the surfaces of snow-slabs while in her father's house. 55.

** NOTES:—पिनाकिनः—(पिनाक+इनिः) पिनाकः अस्यास्तीति पिनाकिन्, तस्य पिनाकिनः** of the wielder of the Pinaka. See notes on **पिनाकपाणि** in verse 53. **पिनाकिनः चरिते** the exploits of the Pinaka-holder (*i. e*., Shiva) such as the destruction of the three cities of demons etc. **उपात्तवर्णे। उपात्तः—(उप+आ+√दा+क्तः=उपात्तः) गृहीतः, आरब्धः** begun. Past part. of **√ दा** with **आ** 'to take'. **वर्णः—गीतिक्रमः** letters; the arrangement of words in a song. **'शुक्लादौ ब्राह्मणादौ च शोभायामक्षरे तथा। गीतिक्रमे स्तुतौ वेषे वर्णशब्दः प्रयुज्यते।' इति हलायुधः। उपात्तः वर्णः यस्मिन् स उपात्तवर्णः, तस्मिन्** begun to be sung in due order. After this **सति** is understood. **सबाष्पकण्ठस्खलितैः—बाष्पेण सह वर्त्तमानः सबाष्पः (गद्गदः) सबाष्पे कण्ठे स्खलितैः**



**(अस्पष्टोच्चारितैः) सबाष्पकण्ठस्खलितैः** faltering (*i.e.*, inarticulate) in the throat choking with tears. Evidently Parvati was moved while singing the heroic feats of Shiva. **पदैः—**by her words. **वनान्तसंगीतसखीः—वनान्ते (वनप्रदेशे) संगति संगीतेन वा सख्यः वनान्तसंगीतसख्यः, ताः वनान्तसंगीतसखीः** (Acc. plural) Companions in the songs sung in the forest plots. **संगीत** is Past part. from **√गै** to sing **गै** is changed to **गी** by **'घुमास्थागापाजहातिसां हलि' पा० ६४.६६ । किन्नरराजकन्यकाः—किन्नराणां राजा किन्नरराजः, किन्नरराजस्य कन्यकाः किन्नरराजकन्यकाः, ताः** (Aee-plural) the daughters of the Kinnara king. **किन्नर**s in later mythology are reckoned among the Gandharvas or celestial choristers and celebrated as musicians. In **कन्यकाः (कन्या+कन्)** the **कन्** suffix is in **स्वार्थे** (*i.e.*, its presence does not cause any change in the meaning of the word), so **कन्याः एव कन्यकाः।** Parvati, being herself a princess could make friends only with princesses. **अनेकशः—एकं एकं इति एकशः (एक+शस्); न एकशः अनेकशः (बहुशः)** many a time; in numbers. **शस्**is added to numerals when repetition is made by **'संख्यैकवचनाच्च वीप्सायाम्' पा० ५.४.४३. । अरोदयत्—(√रुद्+णिच्+लङ्)** made them weep. Causal Imperfect of **√रुद्।**

 In this verse there is a reference to **मूर्छावस्था** (the state of being unconscious) or, according to others **प्रलापावस्था** (*i.e*., singing in praise of one's beloved). 56.

** NOTES:—त्रिभागशेषासु—शिष्यते इति शेषः (√शिष्+घञ्)** what is left. The comp. **त्रिभागशेषासु** may be expounded and interpreted in two different ways. **(i) त्रिभ्यो भागेभ्यः** **शेषासु त्रिभागशेषासु(उत्तरपदे द्विगुः)** what was left of nights after their three parts had passed, *i. e*. during the fourth part of the night. In this case the night is divided into four parts or quarters. **(ii) तृतीयो भागः त्रिभागः, त्रिभागः शेषो यासां ताः त्रिभागाः तासु** in the nights of which only the third part was left. Here a night is divided into three parts or watches, (*Cf.* The word **त्रियामा त्रयो यामाः यस्याः सा**—a night), and the word **त्रि** is taken in the sense of the ordinal **तृतीय,** just as **शत** and **सहस्र** are ordinals in the words **शतांशः (=शततमांशः)** and **सहस्त्रांशः (=सहस्रतमांशः)।** Parvati could not get sound sleep during the whole of night and she was generally awakened by her thoughts about Shiva during the last part of the night. **निमील्य—(नि+√मील्** to close **+ल्यप्)** having shut. **क्षणं नेत्रे निमील्य—***i. e.*, having slept for a little while. When preceded by **उत्; √मील** means 'to open', *e. g.*, **उन्मीलन। सहसा—अकस्मात्** all of a sudden. **नीलकण्ठ—नीलः कण्ठो यस्य स नीलकण्ठः, तस्य संबोधने** O thou of azure neck; blue-necked. Shiva is called Nilakantha because his neck had become black by swallowing the poison produced at the churning of the ocean. **'क्व व्रजसि'—'**where art thou going?**'** such were the cries uttered by Parvati in the subconscious state of her



mind. **अलक्ष्यवाक्—अविद्यमानं लक्ष्यं यस्याः सा अलक्ष्या** (Adj.of **वाक्**) **अलक्ष्या वाग्। यस्याः सा अलक्ष्यवाक्** (Adj. of Parvati) whose speech was uttered without a particular aim or without there being any person present to whom the words could be addressed, *i. e*. whose cries were incoherent.** असत्यकण्ठार्पितबाहुबन्धना—न सत्यः असत्यः (अविद्यमानः); असत्ये कण्ठे अर्पितं (दत्तं) बाह्वोः बन्धनं यया सा,** having her arms thrown tight round an imaginary neck. Although there was no person at the time near about Parvati, yet she used to address words as if to some person present there and to throw her arms for embracing the person imagined to be present. **व्यबुध्यत—(वि+√बुध** to get up **+लङ्)** woke up.

 This verse is quoted in the Sahityadarpana as an instance of **प्रलाप (अलक्ष्यवाक् प्रलापः स्याच्चेतसो भ्रमणाद् भृशम्)।** According to Mallinatha it describes **जागर** (absence of sleep) and **उन्माद** (madness, in which incoherent words are uttered). 57.

** ENGLISH TRANSLATION:—**Moreover, at night, when its third (or fourth) part only remained, she, having



closed her eyes for a moment, all of a sudden woke up with cries without a listener such as 'O thou of blue neck, where dost thou go?' (and) having her arms thrown tight round an imaginary neck. 57.

** NOTES:—यदा—**when. Some books read **सदा** for **यदा। बुधैः—(√बुध्+कः) पण्डितैः** by the wise. **सर्वगतः—सर्वं गतः (प्राप्तः) सर्वगतः (सर्वान्तर्यामी)** all-pervading; omnipresent. The compound is **द्वितीयातत्पुरुष** by **'द्वितीया श्रितातीतपतितगतात्यस्तप्राप्तापन्नैः' पा० २.१.२४ । उच्यसे—कथ्यसे** is said or known. Passive present second pers. sing. of **√वच्** 'to speak.' **भावस्थं—(√स्था+कः) भावे (अनुरागे) तिष्ठितीति भावस्थः, तम् (त्वदनुरागिणम्)** being in love (with you); who is love-smitten; enamoured. **क** is added by **'सुपि स्थः' पा० ३.२.४ ।** The compound is an instance of **उपपदसमास** *i. e.*, in which the second member of a Tatpurusha Comp. is a root noun derived from a root which takes a particular Krit affix (here **कः)** by virtue of the presence of the first member. **इमं जनम्**—*i. e.*, Parvati. **मुग्धया—(√मुह्** to be foolish; to faint+ **क्तः। ह्** is changed to **घ्** and then to**ग्‚** and **त** to **ध**) by the foolish; innocent. Parvati has been rightly terined so, because she being love-smitten did not realize that it was of little avail to talk to a picture. In the books on rhetoric **मुग्धा** is a variety of **नायिका। स्वहस्तोल्लिखितः उल्लिखितः—(उत्+√लिख्+क्तः) चित्रितः** painted or drawn. **स्वेन हस्तेन उल्लिखितः स्वहस्तोल्लिखितः** drawn with her own hand. **चन्द्रशेखरः—चन्द्रः शेखरो यस्य** or **चन्द्रः शेखरे यस्य सः** moon-crested *i. e*.. Shiva. It is well-known that Shiva bears the crescent moon on his forehead. **रहसि—एकान्ते** in private. **उपालभ्यत—(उप+√लभ्+य+लङ्) अधिक्षिप्यते स्म** was upbraided; scolded.
**√लभ्**when preceded by **उप+आ** means 'to reproach; to censure.'

 "Drawing the beloved's picture is one of the four



ways by which lovers in separation beguile longing." The other three ways are **स्वप्नदर्शन, सादृश्यदर्शन and तदङ्गस्पृष्टस्पर्श।** *Cf* **"वियोगावस्थासु प्रियजनसदृशानुभवनं, ततश्चित्रं कर्म स्वपनसमये दर्शनमपि। तदङ्गस्पृष्टानामुपगतवतां स्पर्शनमपि, प्रतीकारः कामव्यथितमनसां कोऽपि कथितः।'** Of the ten states of lovers caused by love-affliction this verse refers to **ह्रोत्यागः** (abandonment of modesty). 58.

** NOTES:—सख्या—**by our friend Parvati. **कृतजन्मसुकृतं जन्म येषां ते, तेषु** which were given birth to; which were planted (by her). **तपःसाक्षिषु—तपः साक्षिषु** been the witness of her penance. For the which have word **साक्षिन्**



see notes on **तपःसाक्ष्ये** in verse 25 above. The trees have been described as witnesses of Parvati's penance because they were planted just on her arrival in the forest and because they remained by her side day and night during the practice of penance. **शशिमौलिसंश्रयः। शशिमौलि—शशः अस्यास्तीति शशो (शश+इनिः) चन्द्रः; शशि मौलौ (मस्तके) यस्य** or **शशी मौलिः (शेखरः) यस्य स शशिमौलिः (शिवः)** the moon-crested, *i. e.*, Shiva. The word **मौलि** means 'head' as well as 'a crest', hence the compound may be expounded in both the ways. **संश्रयः—(सं+√श्रि+अच्) संश्रीयते इति संश्रयः (अवलम्बः)** basis; support. **शशि मौलिः संश्रयो यस्य स शशिमौलिसंश्रयः** which has as its basis the moon-crested God. **मनोरथः—अभिलाषः** desire; craving of her heart *i. e*. the longing to win Shiva. **प्ररोहाभिमुखः। प्ररोहः—(प्र+√रुह्+घञ्) प्ररोहतीति प्ररोहः (अङ्कुरः)** sprout **'प्ररोहस्त्वङकुरः' इति वैजयन्तीकोशः। प्ररोहस्य अभिमुखः प्ररोहाभिमुखः** towards sprouting; about to sprout. **न दृश्यते—***i. e*. does not seem to be showing signs of sprouting; she has not even a distant hope of the fulfilment of her object. The contrast between the plants and the desire of Parvati is really poetic. 60.

** NOTES:—प्रार्थितदुर्लभः (प्र+√अर्थ्+क्त। दुर्+√लभ+खल्) प्रार्थितश्चासौ दुर्लभश्च इति प्रार्थितदुर्लभः** who is difficult to be obtained though sought after. This is a reply to **'भविष्यति प्रार्थितदुर्लभः कथम्?'** in verse 46 above. **सः—शिवः। तपःकृशां—तपसा कृशा तपःकृशा, ताम्** emaciated by austerities. **कृश—(√कृश+क्तः)** Past Part. of **√कृश्** It is formed irregularly by dropping **क्तः।** **अस्रोत्तरम्—अस्रं(अश्रु) उत्तरं (प्रधानं) यस्मिन् कर्मणि तद् अस्रोत्तरम्** or**अस्रैःउत्तरं यथा स्यात् तथा अस्रोत्तरम्** with tears. **ईक्षिताम्—दृष्टाम्** seen. **तदवग्रहक्षताम् अवग्रहः—(अव+ग्रह+अप्) वर्षप्रतिबन्धः** drought. **'वृष्टिर्वर्षं तद्विघातेऽवग्रहावग्रहौ समौ' इत्यमरः।** The **अप्** suffix is optionally added by** 'अवे ग्रहो वर्षप्रतिबन्धे' पा० ३. ३. ५१.** The other form is **अवग्राहः** which is formed by adding **घञ् तस्य (इन्द्रस्य) अवग्रहेण क्षतां (पीडितां) तदवग्रहक्षताम्** distressed by his holding of the rain. As **अवग्रह** means 'absence of rain' there is no use saying **तद् अवग्रह,** so Mallinatha takes **तद्** separately as the object of **न वेद्मि.** But this seems to be far-fetched. **तद्** is a part of the compound and it refera to **वृषेन् सीतां—लाङ्गलरेखां; कष्टां भुवम्** a furrow or line of a plough-share, hence ploughed land. **'सीता लाङ्गलरेखा स्याद् व्योमगङ्गा च जानकी। वृषा**—**वर्षति इति वृषा** the showerer; Indra, the god of rain. **'वासवो वृत्रहा वृषा' इत्यमरः।** **अभ्युपपत्स्यते—अनुग्रहीष्यति** will favour. **अभि+उप्+√पद्** means 'to favour'; to confer a benefit or kindness. The whole sentence from **प्रार्थितदुर्लभः** to**अभ्युपपत्स्यते** is the object.

 In the verse Shiva has been compared to Indra and Parvati to the earth. Just as the earth is distressed by



the stoppage of the rain so was Parvati suffering from the indifference of Shiva.

** CHANGE OF VOICE:—**प्रार्थितदुर्लभेन तेन तपःकृशा सखीभिः अस्रात्तरं ईक्षिता इयं सखी तदवग्रहक्षता सीता वृष्णा इव कदा अभ्युपपत्स्यते (इति) (मया) न वेद्यते॥६१॥

** NOTES:—अद्रेः—पर्वतस्य** of the mountain, *i.e*, of the Himalaya. **'अद्रिगोत्रगिरिग्रावाचलशैलशिलोच्चयाः'इत्यमरः। तनया—पुत्री** the daughter, *i.e.*, Parvati. **मुकुलीकृताङ्गुलौ। मुकुलीकृताः—(मुकुल+च्विः+कृताः) अमुकुलाः मुकुलीःकृताः इति मुकुलीकृताः (संपुटीकृताः)** joined or brougbt together like a bud; formed in the shape of a bud. **मुकल—**bud. **च्वि** suffix is added to nouns or indeclinable to express that a person or thing, not being like what is denoted by the base to which it is added, becomes or is made like it. Here the fingers, which were not joined in the form of a bud, were joined in that manner. **'(अभूततद्भावे) कृभ्वस्तियेागे संपद्यकत्तरि च्विः' पा० ५.४.५०.**Before **च्वि** the ending **अ**or **आ** is changed to **इ,** but not that of indeclinables, **इ** or **उ** is lengthened and **कृ**



changed to **री।** Then the termination **(च्वि)** is dropped and the verbal or other forms of **कृ, भू** and **अस्** roots of, are added to the base regarded as a preposition. **मुकुलीकृताङ्गुलौ**—**मुकुलीकृताः
अङ्गुलयो यस्य सः, तस्मिन्** of which the fingers were joined like a bud **अग्रहस्ते—अग्रश्चासौ हस्तश्च इति अग्रहस्तः, तस्मिन्** in her forehand. The compound is Karmadharaya. But in a Karmadharaya compound both the members are identical with each other; for instance in **श्वेतकमल, श्वेतत्व** (whiteness) and **कमल** (a lotus) are identical, while in **अग्रहस्त, अग्र** is a part of **हस्त** and they are not identical with each other. They may, however, be regarded as such metaphorically, through their relation of **अवयव** and **अवयविन्** *Cf.* **'हस्ताग्र अग्रहस्तयाः गुणगुणिनोर्भेदाभेदात्' वामनः।** or **हस्तस्य अग्रे इति अग्रहस्ते.** The compound may be regarded a member of the group of **राजदन्तादि** and thereby **हस्त** be made the second member of the compound instead of the first. **स्फटिकाक्षमालिकाम्—स्फटिकानां स्फटिकनिर्मिता वा अक्षमालिका स्फटिकाक्षमालिका, ताम्** a rosary made of crystal beads or, a crystal rosary. Here **अक्षमालिका** means simply 'a rosary.' **समर्पयन्ती—(सम्+√अप्+णिच्+शतृ+ङीप्) आमुञ्चती** putting; holding. **चिरव्यवस्थापितवाक्—चिरेण व्यवस्थापिता वाक् यया सा चिरव्यवस्थापितवाक्** having put in order (in her mind) the speech for a long time, *i.e.*, having pondered for long time as to what to say and what not. **कथञ्चित्—**with great difficulty. Because she was moved very much, or she was feeling shy of speaking in such a matter. **मिताक्षरम्—(√मा+क्तः=मितम्) मितानि अक्षराणि यस्मिन्-**



**कर्मणि यथा स्यात्तथा मित्ताक्षरम्** in limited words.**अभाषत**—spoke. Imperfect third pers. sing. of **√भाष्,** 63.

According to Mallinatha **यथा** is used in the sense of 'truth; correct thing.' It may also be taken with the following words *viz*., **त्वया यथा श्रुतं अयं जनः** etc., as you have heard this person is anxious to attain the highest post. Or, **तथा** may be provided after **यथा;**then it will be construed as **यथा श्रुतं तत्तथा** it is so as as you have heard. **उच्चैः पदलङ्घनोत्सुकः—उच्चैः पदस्य (स्थानस्य) लङ्घने (प्राप्तौ) उत्सुकः** anxious to attain the lofty post.

** NOTES:—वर्णी—**Brahmacharin. See notes on **वर्णिनं** in verse 52. **आह—उवाच** said. It being Present tense, third person, sing., its use in the sense of the Past tense is open to question. But according to some commenators **आह** may be used with **अथ** on the authority of **'तदादौ च'। भोजसूत्रम्। आह** is the alternative substitute for**√ब्रू** 'to speak in all the numbers of the third person and sing and dual of the second person. **'ब्रुवः पञ्चानामादित आहो ब्रूवः' पा० ३.४.४८.** Thus **√ब्रू** is conjugated in the present tense as—**ब्रवीति—आह, ब्रूतः—आहतुः, ब्रूवन्ति—आहुः। ब्रवीषि—आत्थ, ब्रूथः—आहथुः, ब्रूथ। ब्रवीमि. ब्रूवः, ब्रूमः। महेश्वरः—(महा+ईश्वरः) महांश्चासौ ईश्वरः महेश्वरः (महादेवः)** Shiva. The word **महत्** is changed to **महा** when it forms the first member of a Karmadharaya or a Bahuvrihi compound, or when the termination **जातीय** follows. **'आन्महतः समानाधिकरणजातीययोः, पा० ६.३.४६. विदितः—ज्ञातः** is known. In **विदितः (√विद्+**



**क्तः) क्त** suffix is added by **'मतिबुद्धिपूजार्थेभ्यश्च' पा० ३.२.१८८.** in the sense of the present tense. The subject of **विदितः***viz*. **मन** is understood. The Brahmacharin means to say that he knew Maheshwara as one who against the desire of Parvati burnt Kamadeva and did not agree to marry her. **एव—अपि । तदर्थिनाी—(तत्+अर्थ+ इनिः+ङीप्) अर्थः अस्याः अस्तीति अर्थिनी, तस्य अर्थिनीतदर्थिनी (तदभिलाषिणी)** longing for him; seeking him.**अमङ्गलाभ्यासरतिं—न मङ्गलं अमङ्गलं, तस्य (अशुभस्य) अभ्यासे (निरन्तरसेवने) रतिः यस्य सः अमङ्गलाभ्यासरतिः, तम्** who is fond of using inauspicious, things (such as funeral pyre, ashes, skull-bone, etc.) *Cf*. **'आलेपो भसितं विभूषितमहिर्वासः पितॄणां वने, वेतालाः परिचारकाः प्रतिदिनं वृत्तिश्च भिक्षामयी । इत्थं यस्य शुभेतराणि चरितान्याख्यान्ति सर्वेजनास्तस्मिन्मौग्ध्यवशान्मतिस्तत्र रुचिं बध्नाति किं ब्रूमहे।' पार्वतीपरिणय ४.१२. अनुवृत्तिं—अनुसरणं;** **अनुमोदनम्** to follow; to give my approval. **न** **उत्सहे**—I dare not.**√सह्** 'to bear' means 'to dare' with the preposition **उत्.** The ascetic says when Shiva had insulted Parvati once and he had inborn fondness for inauspicious things he was not ready to approve of the idea of Parvati to marry him. 65.

** CHANGE OF VOICE:—**अथ, वर्णिना (ऊचे)—(अहं) महेश्वरं विदितवान्, त्वया पुनरेव तदर्थिन्या वृत्यते, च तं अमङ्गलाभ्यासरतिं विचिन्त्य (मया) तव अनुवृत्तिं कर्त्तुं न उत्सह्यते॥६५॥

** HINDI TRANSLATION:—**तब ब्रह्मचारी बोला—महादेव को मैं जानता हूँ; तू फिर भी उसी के लिये इच्छा वाली है; (मैं) तो उसको अशुभ वस्तुओं से प्रेम करने वाला जान कर तुम्हारा

**यावदावश्यकं तावत्** adequately; fully. It may also mean 'in the first place.'

The ascetic means to say that leaving other things aside even the articles of dresses of Parvati and Shiva differ very much from each other, and when there is so much incongruity about the outer things how far it was proper for Parvati to have a yearning for Shiva. 67.

It is an Adj. of **पा‌दयोः**and so the sense is that the feet which are accustomed to tread in courtyards or rooms where flowers are scattered in abundance. **अलक्तकाङ्ककानि—अलक्तकः (लाक्षारसः) अङ्कः (चिह्नं) येषु तानि** having marks of red dye.

Shiva is said to live in the cemetery grounds (*Cf*. **'वासः पितृृणां वने'** and so if Parvati was wedded to him she too would have to tread there, which would be in great contrast with his walking in the flowercovered, apartments of her palace. 68.

It is an Adj. of **चिताभस्मरजः।** The **न** of **त्रिनेत्र** is not changed to **ण** because it is included in the group known as **क्षुभ्नादि—'क्षुभ्नादिषु च' पा० ८.४०३९।** Mallinatha has construed it in a different way, *viz*., **त्रिनेत्रवक्षःतव अपि सुलभं अतः परं अयुक्तरूपं किम्?** What can be more unsuitable than that the (embrace of the) bosom of the three-eyed God be easily obtainable for you. In this case **त्रिनेत्रवक्षः** is separated from **सुलभं** while in the former the whole **त्रिनेत्रवक्षःसुलभं** is one compound. **चिताभस्मरजः—चितायाः भस्म एव रजः** the ashes of the funeral pyres (which are applied to his body by Shiva). *Cf*. **'आलेपो भसितं'** quoted in notes on verse 65. **हरिचन्दनास्पदे—हरेः विष्णोरिन्द्रस्य वा चन्दनं हरिचन्दनं, तस्य आस्पदंतस्मिन्**

According to Mallinatha the latter half of the verse is to be construed as—**यत् हरिचन्दनास्पदे अस्मिन् स्तनद्वये चिताभस्मरजः पदं करिष्यति** * i.e,* because the powder of the ashes of funeral pyres will make its abode in the pair of your breasts which have hitherto been a place for sandal-wood paste.

Here **सा** is not followed by, **या,** which should have been according to the general rule **'यत्तदोर्नित्यसम्बन्धः',** because 'when the sense can be easily known the relative pronoun may be left understood. *Cf*. **'प्रकान्तप्रसिद्धानुभूतार्थविषयस्तच्छब्दो यदुपादानं नोपेक्षते।' कान्तिमती—(कान्ति+मतुप्+ङीप्) कान्तिः (द्युतिः) अस्याः अस्तीति कान्तिमती** bright; possessed of lustre.

A handsome woman is often called as such, because she is regarded agreeable to the eyes like the moon-light. *Cf*. **'त्वं कौमुदी नयनयोः अमृतं त्वमङ्गे' उत्तररामचरितम् ३.२९.** It is an Adj. of **त्वं** as well as of **कला। द्वयं—**two things. **शोचनीयताम्** **(√शुच+अनीय+ता) शोकविषयताम्** deplcrableness. **गतम—प्राप्तम्** have become.

 In the Kavya Prakas this verse has been quoted as an instance of the fault **अक्रमत्व** *i.e*, the absence ofthe syntactical order of words, because the particle **च**has been placed after **लोकस्य** instead of **त्वं,** which is its



proper position, for it is the word **त्वं** and not **लोक** that is meant to be conjoined with **कला।**

** NOTES:—एनं—एतं ब्रह्मचारिणं** to this Brahmacharin. **एनं** is the optional form of **इदम्** and **एतत्** in the Accusative sing. to be used when there is **अन्वादेश** *i.e*, their proper forms have already been used in a previous clause. **'द्वितीयाटौस्वेनः' पा० २.४.३४ । नूनं—निश्चयेन** certainly. **परमार्थतः—परमश्चासौ अर्थश्च परमार्थः (सत्यं), तस्मात्** **परमार्थतः(परमार्थ+तसिल्)** in reality; truly; correctly. **परमार्थ** means the highest sense or truth. **तसिल्** is added in the sense of the Ablative by **'पञ्चम्यास्तसिल्' पा० ५.३.७ । न वेत्सि—न जानासि** thou knowest not. This is a refutation of the ascetic's assertion **'विदितो महेश्वरः'** in verse 65.

Now Parvati supports this charge by means of a general statement which means that the dull-minded find fault. with the life of the great, which has something unusual about it and the purpose of which can not be easily understood. **मन्दाः—मूढाः** idiots; dull-witted. **'मूढाल्पापटुनिर्भाग्या मन्दाः' इत्यमरः। अलोकसामान्यम्—न लोकानां लोकषु वा सामान्यं (साधारणं) इति अलोकसामान्यम्** or, **न विद्यते लोके सामान्यं यस्य तत्** which is not in common with that of other people, *i.e*. which has something extraordinary about it. **अचिन्त्यहेतुकम्—(न+√चिन्त्+यत्=अचिन्त्यं) चिन्तयितुं येाग्यं चिन्त्यं; न चिन्त्यं अचिन्त्यं (विचारयितुमशक्यम्)** which can not be grasped. **अचिन्त्यः हेतुः (कारणं) यस्य तत् अचिन्त्यहेतुकम्।** the motive of which can not be understood. Parvati means to say that it was not easy for the Brahmacharin to know as to why Shiva lived in nudity and did other similar things. **कप्** is added to **हेतु** because it is at the end of a Bahuvrihi compound, by **'शेषाद् विभाषा' पा० ५.४.१५४ । महात्मनाम्—महान् आत्मा येषां ते महात्मानः, तेषाम्** of the magnanimous; of the great-minded. **चरितं—चरित्रं** the life. **द्विषन्ति—द्वेषेण** **पश्यन्ति** hate; look at it with jealousy.

Or, according to Mallinatha **त्रयाणां लोकानां नाथः** **त्रिलोकनाथः,** but this is not without doubt. See notes on **त्रिलोकसौन्दर्यम्** in verse 41. **भीमरूपः—बिभेति अस्मादिति भीमम्, भीमं रूपं यस्य सः भीमरूपः** who is of terrible form. **शिवः—**the auspicious one; benign. **उदीर्यते—(उद्+√ईर्+य+ते) कथ्यते** is said. **√ईर्** to shake or to go, when preceded by **उत्**means 'to say'. **पिनाकिनः—शिवस्य** of the Pinaka-holder.

 Parvati says that no one can form an accurate idea of Shiva, who is possessed of contradictory qualities, such as, being poor he is the source of all wealth, though living in the cemetery-ground he is the lord of all the three worlds and though of terrible form he is auspicious. When it is so the remarks about Shiva by the



ascetic do not hold good. This verse is a reply to verses 66, 67 and 68. 77.

** CHANGE OF VOICE:—**तेन अकिंचनेन सता संपदां प्रभवेण (भूयते), पितृसद्मगोचरेण (सता) त्रिलोकनाथेन (भूयते), तं भीमरूपं (सन्तं) (जनाः) शिव इति उदीरयन्ति; पिनाकिनः याथार्थ्यविद्भिः न भूयते ॥७७॥

** ENGLISH TRANSLATION:—**Though poor, he is the source of wealth; living in the cemetery ground, he is the lord of the three worlds; being of terrible form, he is called auspicious. There is none who knows the reality about the Pinaka-holder (*i.e*., Shiva). 77.

'**जगत्सिसृक्षासमयेषु वेधसां प्रणामलोलानि शिरांसि पादयोः। जगद्विंरामेषु** **कपालशेषतां गतानि तिष्ठन्ति जटासु धूर्जटेः।'** According to another legend 'Shiva once got very angry with Brahman on hearing the latter's proud declaration that he (Shiva) had sprung from his forehead, etc., and created in anger the fierce Kalabhairava, who severed one of the heads of Brahman with his nails. Shiva, therefore, wore, as Kalabhairava, the skull of Brahman's head. **इन्दुशेखरं—इन्दुः शेखरो (शेखरे वा) यस्य तत्** having moon on its crest. **विभूषणोद्भासि**etc. are Adjectives of **वपुः** and so in neuter gender nom. singular.

 Parvati means to say that Shiva's form is a puzzle for the people, which they can never solve. Therefore to say that his form is such and such is not right. This is a reply to verses 66, 67‚ 71. and 78.

** CHANGE OF VOICE:—**विश्वमूर्त्तेःवपुः (जनाः) न अवधारयन्ति, (तेन) विभूषणोद्भासिना वा पिनद्धभोगिना, गजाजिनालम्बिना वा दुकूलधारिणा, कपालिना वा अथवा इन्दुशेखरेण भूयते॥७८॥

Or, **चितायाः भस्मनो रजः (चूर्णं) चिताभस्मरजः** the particles of the ashes of the funeral pyre (with which Shiva besmears his body). **तदङ्गसंसर्गं—तस्य (शिवस्य) अङ्गस्य (देहस्य) संसर्गं (संपर्कं) तदङ्गसंसर्गं** contact with his body. **अवाप्य—प्राप्य** having obtained. **ध्रुवं—निश्चयेन** indeed; surely. **शुद्धये—पवित्रताकरणाय** for purification; sanctifying. Dative is used by the rule **'क्लृपि संपद्यमाने च'** which means 'a noun expressive of the purpose for which anything is done, or the result to which anything leads is put in the Dative case.' **नृत्याभिनयक्रियाच्युतम्। अभिनयः—हृद्गतभावाभिव्यञ्जकशरीरचेष्टाः** movements of the body indicative of internal feelings; gesticulations. **नृत्ये(ताण्डवे) अभिनयः एव क्रिया नृत्याभिनयक्रिया, तया च्युतम् नृत्याभिनयक्रियाच्युतम्।** dropped down by the movements of the body while dancing. Adj. of **तत्** understood. Shiva's dance is known as **ताण्डव,** which is a very vehement dance. **अम्बरौकसाम्—अम्बरं (व्योम) ओकः (गृहं) येषां ते अम्बरौकसः तेषां** whose abode is in the heaven, i. e, gods (then to say nothing of human beings). **ओकः—गृहं 'ओकः सद्मनि चाश्रये' इत्यमरः। मौलिभिः—शिरोभिः**on heads or foreheads. **विलिप्यते—**is rubbed; is applied.

 Parvati says that Shiva's body is so much sanctifying that even the ashes of the funeral pyre are made purifying and fit for the use of gods by its contact. This is a reply to **'पदं चिताभस्मरजः करिष्यति'** in verse 62.79

** CHANGE OF VOICE:—**चिताभस्मरजसा अपि तदङ्गसंसर्गं

 **NOTES:—प्रभिन्नदिग्वारणवाहनः। प्रभिन्नः—(प्र‌+भिद्+क्तः) मदयुक्तः** shedding ichor **(मद)।** Literally it means whose temples are split open (for shedding ichor). **'प्रभिन्नो गर्जितोमत्तः** **इत्यमरः। दिग्वारणः—दिशः (प्राचीदिशः) वारणः (हस्ती) दिग्वारणः** the elephant of the eastern quarter (which belongs to Indra and is named **ऐरावत).** He is one of those elephants which, according to mythology, stand in the four or eight quarters of the sky and support the earth. **वारणः—**an elephant. **'मतङ्गजो गजो नागः कुञ्जरो वारणः करी'** **इत्यमरः। वाहनं—(वह्+ल्युट्—अन) यानम्** a conveyance. **प्रभिन्नः दिग्वारणः वाहनं यस्य सः प्रभिन्नदिग्वारणवाहनः** having for hus vehicle the rutting elephant of the (eastern) quarter. Or, according to some interpretors**—प्रभिन्नाः (पराभूताः) दिग्वारणाः (स्वातिरिक्तः दिग्गजाः) येन सः प्रभिन्नदिग्वारणः; तादृशं वाहनं यस्य सः प्रभिन्नदिग्वारण वाहनः** who has for his vehicle the elephant of the (eastern) quarter, who has routed other elephants of the quarters. **वृषा—वर्षतीति वृषा इन्द्रः** Indra.'**वासवो वृत्रहा वृषा' इत्यमरः।** See notes on it in verse 61. **उपगम्य—(उप+√गम्+ल्यप्) समीपं आगत्य** coming near; approaching. **असम्पदः—नास्ति संपद् यस्य सः असम्पत्, तस्य** of him who possesses no wealth. **वृषेण—वृषभेण** on a bull. **'उक्षाभद्रो बलीवर्द ऋषभो वृषभो वृषः' इत्यमरः। तस्य—शिवस्य** of



him (Shiva). **मौलिना—शिरसा** by his head. **विनिद्रमन्दाररजोरुणाङ्गुली। विनिद्रः—विगता****निद्रा यस्य स विनिद्रः (विकसित)** a full-blown flower. **मन्दारः—देववृक्षः** one of the five trees of paradise. Here, the flowers of that tree, so **मन्दारस्य इमे मन्दाराः (मन्दार+अण्)। अण्** is dropped and hence no change in the word. **प्रभिन्नानां मन्दाराणां रजोभिः (परागैः) अरुणाः (रक्ताः) अङ्गुलयो ययोस्तौ प्रभिन्नमन्दाररजोरुणाङ्गुली** whose toes are made red with the pollendust of the full-blown flowers of the heavenly trees. Adj. of **पादौ।** The colour of the toes of Shiva's feet is changed by the colour of Mandar flowers borne on the head by Indra.

 This verse is a suitable reply to **‘इयं च तेऽन्या पुरतो विडम्बना'** verse No. 70. and contains a contrast between **वृष** (a bull) and **दिग्वारण** (an elephant of the quarters). Parvati says it is immaterial if Shiva has a bull for his vehicle when Indra whose vehicle is **ऐरावत** coming to him bows his head before him. It shows the real greatness of Shiva. 80.

** NOTES:—च्युतात्मना—च्युतः (पतितः) आत्मा (अन्तःकरणं) यस्य सः च्युतात्मा, तेन** one possessing a depraved



soul. Parvati calls the ascetic so because he talked so much ill of Shiva. **विवक्षता—(√वच्+सन्+शतृ) वक्तुं इच्छति विवक्षति, विवक्षति इति विवक्षन् (वक्तुंइच्छन्), तेन विवक्षता** by one who wants to speak. Instrumental sing. of **विवक्षन्** Present part. of the Desiderative of **√वच्,** The suffix **सन्** is added to express desire. **अपि—**though you wanted to point out Shiva's faults you have unconsciously said one good point about him. **ईशं प्रति—महेशं प्रति** with regard to the Lord. Accusative is used because of **प्रति।** **'अभितः परितः समया निकषा हा प्रतियोगेऽति।' साधु—सम्यक्** a good point. viz **अलक्ष्यजन्मता** in verse 72. **आत्मभुवः—(आत्मन्+√भू+क्विप्) आत्मना (स्वयमेव) भवतीति आत्मभूः (ब्रह्मा), तेन आत्मभूवः** of the self-existent *i.e*. of Brahman. **'ब्रह्मा आत्मभूः सुरज्येष्ठः परमेष्ठी पितामहः' इत्यमरः। कारणं—**the cause of uirth; the creator. *Cf* **'यो वै ब्रह्माणं विदधाति** **पूर्वम्'** said of the Lord of universe. **आमनन्ति—प्रतिपादयन्ति** describe; celebrate; consider. **√म्ना** to praise; to learn, is changed to **मन** in the **सार्वधातुक लकारऽ** by **'पाघ्राध्मास्थाम्नादाणदृश्यर्त्तिसर्त्तिशदसदां पिबजिघ्रधमतिष्ठमनयच्छपश्यच्छवौशीयसीदाः'। पा० ८.३.७८ ।** which replaces**√पा** etc. by **पिब** etc, respectively. **लक्ष्यप्रभवः—प्रभवति अस्मात्** **इति प्रभवः (उत्पत्तिस्थानम्); लक्ष्यः (ज्ञेयः) प्रभवः यस्य सः लक्ष्यप्रभुवः** whose origin is known or visible.

 The ascetic had said **अलक्ष्यजन्मता** about Shiva in bad sense, but Parvati has wisely interpreted it in a good sense and has thus given a suitable reply to him. 81.

** NOTES:—विवादेन—(वि+√वद्+घञ्) वाक्कलहेन** quarrels or dispute. Instrumental is used because of **अलं** which is used in the sense of 'enough' See notes on **अलं** **समाधिना** in verse 45. **यथा—**as; of whatever sort. **तथा विधः—तथा विधा (प्रकारः) यस्य स** **तथाविधः** so; of that sort. **अशेषं—नशेषः यस्मिन् कर्माणि तद् अशेषम्‚** fully; without any reservation, **अत्र—**in Shiva. **भावैकरसं—भावः (प्रेम; शृङ्गारः) एकः (अनन्यः) रसः (आनन्दो) यस्य** **तत्** predominated solely by the sentiment of love; entirely swayed by the feeling of love. Or. **भावे (भक्तौ) एकः रसः (आनन्दो) यस्य तत् भावैकरसं** which finds delight only in devotion for Shiva. **भावः—**love, See notes on **भावस्थं** in verse 58. **स्थितम्—निश्चलं** is fixed or set (on him). **कामवृत्तिः—कामं (यथेच्छं) वृत्तिः (वर्त्तनं) यस्य सः** who acts as he likes, or‚**कामः (इच्छा) वृत्तिः यस्य सः** who follows his will. **वचनीयम्—(√वच्+अनीयर्) निन्द‌ां; लोकापवादं** ill-talk, bad report, **न ईक्षते—न विचारयति** does not take into consideration, does not care for. **'न कामवृत्तिर्वचनीयमीक्षते'** is a general statement meaning that a person who follows his own will does not care for other's adverse criticism. This defends Parvati's conduct in not caring for the opinion of the ascetic because she had set her heart on Shiva. 82.

** NOTES:—आलि—सखि** O friend. **'आलिः सखी वयस्या च' इत्यमरः। स्फुरितोत्तराधरः—**It may be expounded in a number of ways:, *viz., * **(i) उत्तरश्च (उत्तरोष्ठश्च) अधरश्च (अधरोष्ठश्च) उत्तराधरं; स्फुरितं (किंचिच्चलितं) उत्तराधरं यस्य सः स्फुरितोत्तराधरः** whose upper and lower lips are quivering (as in the act of speaking). **(ii) स्फुरितं (कम्पनं) उत्तरं (अधिकं) यस्मिन् सः स्फुरितोत्तरः; स्फुरितोत्तरःअधरः यस्य सः स्फुरितोत्तराधरः** whose lower lip is quivering very much. In this case **उत्तर** has been interpreted as meaning 'excessiveness' In the compound **स्फुरितं उत्तरं यस्मिन् सः स्फुरितोत्तरः (बहुव्रीहि)** the word **उत्तर** which, being an Adj., would have been the first member, has been made the second hy **'वाहिताग्न्यादिषु च' पा० २.२.३७.** And if this be not possible it may be expounded as **(iii) स्फुरितेन उत्तरः (युक्तः) स्फुरितोत्तरः, स्फुरितोत्तरः अधरः यस्य सः** whose lower lip was quivering. In this case the word **उत्तर** gives the sense of mixed with. **विवक्षुः—(वच्+सन्+उः) वक्तुं इच्छुः विवक्षुः** desirous of speaking. Noun from the Desiderative of **√वच्,** See notes on **विवक्षन्** in verse 81. **बटुः—**a boy; Brahmacharin. **निवार्यताम्—(नि+√वृ+य+लोट्) निषिध्यताम्** should be checked or warded off. Passive Imperative third pers. singular. **महतः—**about the great. Accusative plu. of **महत् अपभाषते—निन्दां करोति** abuses; talks ill. **पापभाक् (पाप+√भज्+णिव्) पापं भजते (सेवते) इति पापभाक्** a sinner. For the sense Cf., **'गुरोर्यत्र परीवादो निन्दा वापि प्रवर्तते। कर्णौ तत्र पिधातव्यौ गन्तव्यं वा ततोऽन्यतः॥' मनुस्मृति।** The fact that



Parvati was not prepared to listen to the ill-talk about Shiva, shows that she was sincerely devoted to him 83.

 **NOTES:—वीक्ष्य—(वि+ईक्ष्+ल्यप्) दृष्ट्वा** having seen. **वेपथुमती। वेपथुः—(√वेप्** to tremble+**अथुच्) कम्पनं** trembling. It is a noun formed by adding **अथुच्** by '**टि्वतोऽथुच्' पा० ३.३.८९. वेपथुः (कम्पं) अस्याःअस्तीति वेपथुमती (वेपथु+मतुप्+ङीप्) कम्पयुक्ता** trembling. **वेपथु** is one of the **सात्त्विकभावऽ** *i.e.,* the various states of body caused by some natural emotion. They are eight in number, namely—**'स्तम्भः स्वेदोऽथ रोमाच्चः स्वरभङ्गोऽथ वेपथुः। वैवण्यमश्रुप्रलयावित्यष्टौ सात्त्विकाः गुणाः।'** Here **वेपथु** was caused by the sudden sight of Shiva and particularly by his touch. **सरसाङ्गयष्टिः—अङ्गंयष्टिरिव इति अङ्गयष्टिः (शरीरं)** a slender form; a fairy-figure. **रसेन सह वर्त्तमाना सरसा (सस्वेदा); सरसा** **अङ्गयष्टिः यस्याः सा सरसाङ्गयष्टिः** whose slender form was perspiring. **सरसा—**wet, hence perspiring. This perspiration also was caused by the touch of Shiva. **निक्षेपणाय—(नि+√क्षिप्+ल्युट्—अन=निक्षेपणं) भूमौ विन्यासाय** to step forth; to walk away. The Dative is used because **निक्षेप** expresses the purpose for which the foot was raised. *Cf*. '**तादर्थ्ये चतुर्थी वाच्या'। उद्धृतं उत्थापितम्** raised. **उद्वहन्ती—(उद्+√बह्+शतृ+ङीप्)** having; lit. carrying on. **शैलाधिराजतनया—शिलानां समूहः शैलः (पर्वतः) (शिला+अण्)** a mountain. **शैलानांअधिराजस्य तनया शैलाधिराजतनया** the daughter of the lord of mountains, *i.e.*, Parvati. **मार्गाचलव्यतिकराकुलिता। अचलः—**

Adj. of **सिन्धुः—नदी** a river. '**देशे नदविशेषेऽब्धौ सिन्धुर्ना सरिति स्त्रियाम्' इत्यमरः। ययौ—(√या+लिट्) जगाम** went. **तस्थौ—(√स्था+लिट्) स्थिता** stayed.

 Parvati who was ready to start, seeing Shiva in her front could not make her mind to go or to stay—she wanted to go because she had started and she wanted to stay because she liked to be with Shiva. This state of Parvati is well compared with a river which is impeded on its way by a hill.

 The metre of this and the following shloka is **वसन्ततिलका** which is defined as**—“उक्ता वसन्ततिलकातभजा जगौ गः।”** 85.

**अद्य प्रभृति—**from today. Though **अद्य** has the sense of the Locative case it has been used with **प्रभृति** and so it gives the sense of the Ablative. See also notes on **तदा प्रभृति** in verse 55. **क्रीतः—**purchased. **दासः—दासते आत्मानं ददाति इति दासः—**a slave. **चन्द्रमौलौ—**Locative of **चन्द्रमौलि** moon-crested God.

This action of Parvati is supported by a general statement—**क्लेशः फलेन हि पुनर्नवतां विधत्ते। क्लेशः—क्लमः** fatigue; pain. **फलेन—**by the attainment of fruit. **पुनः—**again. **नवतां—नूतनताम्** freshness. **विधत्ते—करोति** does. **√धा**to put on, means 'to do' with **वि.** Note that **√धा** is **उभयपदी,** so**दधाति** and **धत्ते (लट्)।** It means that a person forgets all about his fatigue and becomes refreshed by the attainment of the fruit of his exertion. 86.

 **Q. I.** Translate into English or Hindi —

प्रयुक्तसत्कार विशेषमात्मना न मां परं संप्रतिपत्तुमर्हसि ।  
यतः सतां संनतगात्रि संगतं मनीषिभिः साप्तपदीनमुच्यते॥

** A—HINDI TRANSLATION:—**(तुमने) अपने आप जिसका विशेष आदर किया है ऐसे मुझको कोई दूसरा (अजनवी) मानना उचित नहीं है; क्योंकि हे सुन्दरि बुद्धिमान लोग सज्जनों की मित्रता को सात शब्दों के बोलने (या) पैरों के चलने से होने वाली कहते हैं।

** ENGLISH TRANSLATION:—** lt does not behove thee to regard me as a stranger, to whom special hospitality has been accorded by thee; for, O, one of stooping body the friendship of good people is declared by the wise to be formed after seven words have been exchanged between them (or) after seven steps have been walked together.

** Q. II.** Write a grammatical note on **साप्तपदीनम्**

** A—सप्तानां पदानाम् समाहारः सप्तपदम् (द्विगु समासः) सप्तपदेन (सप्तभिः पदैः वा) अवाप्यते इति साप्तपदीनम्।** The word **पद** has two meanings *viz*., 'a word' and a footstep, so the expression means 'which is formed by uttering seven words' or 'by walking over seven steps together' *i.e.*, friendship. The word has lost literal sense and is used for friendship. It is regularly formed to indicate this meaning by the Sutra **" साप्तपदीनं सख्यम् "।**



** Q. III.** Explain any two of the following with reference to the context in Hindi and English or Sanskrit:—

 **(a)** क ईप्सितार्थस्थिरनिश्चयं मनः पयश्च निम्नाभिमुखं प्रतीपयेत्।

 **(b)** न धर्म वृद्धेषु वयः समीक्ष्यते।

 **Ans. (a)** जब पार्वती जी ने शंकर जी को पाने के वास्ते कठोर तप करने का विचार कर लिया और अपनी माता के बहुत समझाने पर भी न माना उस समय कवि अपना यह वक्तव्य प्रकट करता है—चाही हुई वस्तु के लिये दृढ़ निश्चय वाले मन को और नीचे की ओर जाते हुये जल कोकौन पलट सकता है। भाव यह है कि जिस प्रकार जल जो नीचे की ओर बह रहा है नहीं रोका जा सकता उसी प्रकार यदि किसी व्यक्ति ने किसी वस्तु के पाने का दृढ़ संकल्प कर लिया है तो उसके मन को भी कोई नहीं रोक सकता। इसमें अर्थान्तरन्यास अलंकार है। When Parvati made up her mind to perform penance to get Shiva for her husband, her mother tried her best to dissuade her from her determination, but was not successful. In that connection the poet makes his remark—who can turn back a mind of firm determination for (the achievement of) a desired object, or water flowing towards a low ground? The sense is that as water flowing to a lower level cannot be checked similarly a mind of firm determination cannot be dissuaded from determination.

 यदा पार्वती शिवं पतिं वरयितुं तपः कर्तुम् च मनसिनिश्चितवती तदा तस्याः माता ताम् तस्मात् महतः मुनिव्रतात् निवारयितुं प्रयत्नं कृतवती किन्तु तस्याः श्रमः व्यर्थः अभूत्। अस्मिन्नेव प्रसङ्गे कविः अर्थान्तरन्यासेन कथयति—यथा अधः गच्छन्तं जलं



रोद्धुं कोऽपि न समर्थो भवति तथैव कृतदृढनिश्चयं मनोऽपि स्वविचारात् निवारयितुं न कोऽपि समर्थः।

** (b)** न धर्म वृद्धेषु वयः समाक्ष्यत।

 पार्वती ने जङ्गल में जाकर इतनी कठिन तपस्या की कि उसको देखने के वास्ते बड़े बड़े मुनि आने लगे इसी संबंध में कवि कहता है यद्यपि पार्वती की अवस्था कम थी तो भी उसको देखने के वास्ते बड़े बड़े मुनि लोग जो आये इसका कारण यह है कि धर्म में बढ़े हुये व्यक्तियों की आयु नहीं देखी जाती। उनके गुण का आदर होता है। When Parvati went to forest she performed such a severe penance that many sages came to see her and in that connection the poet says that it was not strange for age is not teken into consideration in case of those who are advanced in virtue. Age does not count with them who are advanced in virtue.

 यदा पार्वती काननं जगाम तदा सा तत्र ईदृशं तपः चकार यत् मुनयश्च तां द्रष्टुमगच्छन्। अस्मिन् विषये आश्चर्यः न कार्यः यतः धर्मप्रधानेषु पुरुषेषु वयः न समीक्ष्यते। यथाह "गुणाः पूजास्थानं गुणिषु न च लिङ्ग न च वयः"

** Ans. II (a)** सबसे पहले यह तुम्हारी और दूसरी हँसी होगी कि श्रेष्ठ हाथी पर चढ़ने योग्य विवाहित तुमको (शिवजी के) बुड्ढे बैल पर बैठे देखकर बड़े आदमी मुस्कराने लगेंगे। Then, first of all, there will be another humiliation for thee, when great men will have smiling countenances seeing thee, fit to be borne by a lordly elephant, riding an old bull, after marriage.

** (b)** जो अत्यधिक मूल्यवाली सेज पर करवट लेने से गिरे हुए अपने बालों के फूलों से भी कष्ट पाती थी, बह अब अपनी लता के समान भुजा की तकिया लगाकर नंगी भूमि पर ही सोती और बैठती थी।She who would feel pain even by the flowers dropped down from her hair by the rollings on her costly bedslept and sat on the bare earth using her creeper like arm as a pillow.

** Ans. III. (a)** जब ब्रह्मचारी का रूप धारण कर शङ्करजी ने पार्वती को बहुतेरा समझाया और अपना (शङ्करजी का) दोष भी उनको बताया और यह भी कहा कि ऐसे पति की इच्छा न करो। तब पार्वती जी ने कहा कि अब रहने दो, वाद-विवाद मत करो।मैं उनके गुण व अवगुण की परवाह नहीं करती; क्योंकि इच्छा के अनुसार कार्य करनेवाला व्यक्ति बदनामी की परवाह नहीं करता।

** (b)** ब्रह्मचारी वेषधारी शिव ने पार्वती से तपस्या करने का कारण पूछा। और अनेकों तर्कनाएँ करते हुए कहा कि यदि हे



पार्वती तुम पति पाने की इच्छा से तपस्या कर रही हो तो व्यर्थ है क्योंकि रत्नों की खोज लोग स्वयम् करते हैं और रत्न किसी की खोज नहीं करता। अर्थात् हे पार्वती तुम तो स्त्री हो तुम्हें पाने के वास्ते तो लोग स्वयम् प्रयत्न करेंगे। तुम पति खोजने के वास्ते नाहक तपस्या कर रही हो।

 **(c)** जब पार्वती ने तपस्या करने का पूर्ण निश्चय कर लिया उस समय उनकी माता ने उनके निश्चय से उनको हटाना चाहा और उसी संबंध में समझाती हुई उन्होंने कहा कि तुम्हारे कोमल शरीर तथा कठिन तपस्या में बड़ा अन्तर है। कमल का फूल भौंरा का ही बोझ संभाल सकता है पक्षियों का नहीं अर्थात् तुम तपस्या के कठिन दुःख को नहीं सहन कर सकती।

** III. (a)** जब पार्वती की तपस्या से प्रसन्न होकर शिवजी ने उनको साक्षात दर्शन दिया और कहा कि हे पार्वती आज से मैं तुम्हारा दास हो गया हूँ उस समय पार्वती बड़ी प्रसन्न हुईंऔर उनका सारा कष्ट दूर हो गया। क्योंकि फल मिल जाने पर (मनेारथ सफल हो जाने पर) सब कष्ट भूल जाता है। उसी बात को कवि ने यहाँ बतलाया है।

 **(b)** पार्वती जी की तपस्या से प्रसन्न होकर शङ्कर जी ब्रह्मचारी का वेष धारण कर उनके पास गये थे और उनसे सत्कार पाकर पूछने लगे कि हे पार्वती सब कुशल तो है क्योंकि शरीर ही सब धर्मों का साधन है। यही बात कवि ने अर्थान्तरन्यास से कही



है। यदि शरीर कुशल रहेगा तो सभी धर्मकृत्य ठीक से हो सकेंगे।

 **II.** "O thou of stooping limbs, hence forth I am thy Slave, bought by thy austerities"—as the Moon-crested God said these words, she immediately forgot (all) her exhaustion caused by the austerities; for, fatigue gives fresh vigour again by the fruition (*i.e*. the achievement of the desired object).

 **III. (a)** जब ब्रह्मचारी का रूप धारण कर शंकरजी पार्वती से उनकी तपस्या का कारण पूछने लगे तो पार्वती ने उनको उत्तर दिया कि हे ब्रह्मचारी मैं बड़े भारी पद को पाने की (अर्थात् शङ्कर को पाने की) इच्छा से यह तप कर रही हूँ। क्योंकि मनुष्य की इच्छायें कहाँ नहीं जा सकतीं अर्थात् मनुष्य हर एक वस्तु की इच्छा कर सकता है। पार्वती के कहने का भाव यही है कि चूंकि



मनुष्य के इच्छाओं का अन्त नहीं है अतएव मैं भी शंकर जी को पति पाने की इच्छा से तपस्या कर रही हूँ।

 **(b)** जब ब्रह्मचारी शङ्करजी की निन्दा करने लगा तो उस समय पार्वती ने कहा कि तुम शङ्कर जी को ठीक से नहीं समझते हो जो ऐसा कहते हो। क्योंकि मन्द पुरुष महात्माओं के चरित्र की निंदा करते ही हैं।

 **(c)** पार्वती से तप करने का कारण पूछते हुए ब्रह्मचारी शङ्कर जी ने कहा हे पार्वती यह तो हो नहीं सकता कि किसी अपमान के कारण से तुम तपस्या कर रही हो कारण कि पिता के घर में अपमान कैसे हो सकता है। इसी बात को पुष्ट करते हुए कवि कहता है कि सर्प की मणि को कौन छू सकता है। भाव यह कि तुम्हारा अपमान करना सर्प की मणि को छूने के समान है।

 **II. (a)** By her face, which was as fragrant as the lotus (itself) and which shone, with the quivering left of the nether lip, she at night restored the (beauty of) lotuses to the waters (of the stream) the wealth of which was destroyed by the showers of snow.

 "O thou of stooping limbs, henceforth I thy slave, bought by thy austerities"—as the Mooncrested God said these words, she immediately forgot (all) her exhaustion caused by the austerities: for, fatigue gives fresh vigour again by the fruition (*i.e*. the achievement of the desired object).

 **III. (a)** जब शंकर जी ब्रह्मचारी का रूप धारण कर पार्वती के पास आये तब पार्वती ने उठकर उनका खूब सत्कार किया इसी विषय पर कवि कहता है कि विशेष व्यक्तियों में लोगों का कृत्य भी आदरपूर्ण होता है अर्थात् यद्यपि कोई बराबर वाला भी हो तो भी स्थिर चित्त लोग विशेष व्यक्तियों में विशेष प्रकार का व्यवहार करते हैं।

 **(b)** शङ्कर को अपना पति न बनाने के लिये मना करते हुये ब्रह्मचारी ने पार्वती से कहा तुम शिव के योग्य नहीं हो। उसी बात को कवि समझाता है कि यज्ञस्तम्भ के लिये जो वेद की प्रयुक्त क्रिया की जाती है वह क्रिया श्मशान के खम्भे के लिये नहीं की जा सकती। अर्थात् पार्वती के योग्य शिव नहीं हैं।

** (c)** जब ब्रह्मचारी ने शङ्कर जी की निन्दा करते हुये कहा था कि वह तो अमङ्गत वेषधारी है तबपार्वती ने कहा कि ठीक है शङ्कर जी चाहे सर्प पहने, चाहे आभूषणा पहने वे विश्वमूर्ति हैं और सर्वसमर्थ हैं अतः उनका शरीर किसी के समझ में नहीं आ सकता।

** ३—**जब शङ्कर जी ने अपना सच्चा रूप धारण करके पार्वती को पकड़ लिया उस समय उनका शरीर पुलकित हो गया और वे मारे आनन्द के न तो पीछे हट सकीं न आगे बढ़ सकीं उनकी दशा वैसी ही हो गई जैसे उस नदी की जो कि रास्ते में पहाड़ के आ जाने से न आगे बढ़ सकती है न पीछे हट सकती है। वहाँ से हटने की इच्छा रखते हुये भीपार्वती किंकर्तव्यविमूढ़ हो गईं।

** 4 (a)**जब उस ब्रह्मचारी ने अनेक प्रकार से शङ्कर जी की निन्दा किया और कहा कि वह तुम्हारे योग्य नहीं है तब पार्वती जी ने कहा कि वे बाहे जैसे हैं। तुम्हारा कहना ठीक ही क्यों न हो पर मेरा मन तो उन्हीं में लगा है क्योंकि मर्जी के मुताबिक काम करने वाला व्यक्ति बद‌नामी की परवाह नहीं करता। यह



बात सत्य है इसी बात को कवि ने अर्थान्तरन्यास द्वारा बतलाया है।

 

**(b)** जब ब्रह्मचारी ने शङ्कर जी के विषय में कहा कि उनके न तो घर है न धन है तो पार्वती जी ने उत्तर दिया कि वे धन न होते हुये सम्पत्ति के देने वाले हैं त्रिलोकनाथ होने पर भी श्मशान में रहते हैं। भयानक शरीर वाले होते हुए भी शिव हैं। पिनाकी (महादेव) जी की वास्तविकता जानने वाले लोग नहीं हैं।

 **5.** A Mahakavya should be divided into chapters, called **सर्ग**s or cantos. The hero should be either a divine personage or **क्षत्रिय** of noble descent and possessed of the qualities of a **धीरोदात्त नायक (महासत्वोऽतिगंभीरः क्षमावानविकत्थनः। स्थिरो निगूढाहंकारो धीरोदात्तो दृढव्रतः)** This when the work deals with the life of a single hero (as in **शिशुपालवध** or **नैषधीय चरित**)। If it describes the lives of several, they should all be **क्षत्रिय** princes sprung from the same race and pure origin. The principle sentiment **(रस)** may be either **शृङ्गार वीर** or **शान्त** others being introduced to support the predominant one.

 A Mahakavya should be divided into **सर्ग**s not less than eight which should be neither to long nor too short. The verses of each canto should be composed in the same metre, changing only at the end. Sometimes a canto may be written in different metres.

 It should be embellished with descriptions of twilight, the rise of the sun and the moon, the night, the evening, darkness, day, morning, noon and separation of lovers, sages, cities, marriage ceremonies, the



birth of a son etc. The **कुमारसंभव** is a Mahakavya. It is divided into cantos, its hero is a divine personage possessing the qualities of a **धीरोदात्त नायक।** Its predominant sentiment is **शृङ्गार** having **करुण** and **शान्त** as its accessories. Its plot is mythological and it contains the descriptions of cities, season, natural scenery. Thus it contains the features of a **महाकाव्य।**

 **2.** See verses 7 and 85।

** ३—(a)** जब पार्वती जी ने शिव जीके वास्ते तपस्या करना चाहा तो उनकी माता मेना ने उनको बहुत रोका पर पार्वतीन मानी इसी पर कवि कहता है कि चाहीहुई वस्तु के लिये दृढ निश्चय वाले मन को और नीचे की ओर जाते हुये जल को कौन पलट सकता है अर्थात् कोई नहीं। उसी प्रकार शङ्कर जीके वास्ते दृढचित्त वाली पार्वती कोउसकी मा न रोक सकी।

** (b)** तपस्या में लगी हुई वल्कलधारिणी पार्वती को देख कर ब्रह्मचारी ने पूछा कि क्या कारण है कि युवावस्था ही में तुमने अपने आभूषणों को उतार कर बुढ़ाई में शोभा देने वाले वल्कल कोधारण किया है। क्या चन्द्रमा से युक्त तथा ताराओं से व्याप्त रात्रि प्रारम्भ में ही प्रभात में परियात हो सकती है। आभूषणों की उपमा ताराओंसे दी है। वल्कलकी उपमा अरुण से दीहै। भाव यह है कि जब शाम शुरू होती हो और नक्षत्र खिले हाँ उस समय प्रभात का होना शोभा नहीं देता उसी प्रकार युवावस्था में वल्कल का धारण करना शोभा नहीं देता।

** (c)** जब पार्वती तपस्या करने को गईं और वल्कल धारण

कर लिया तबभी उनके मुख की शोभा वैसी ही बनी रही जैसे बालों से। कारण कि कमल की शोभा न केवल भौरों से ही होती है बल्कि शैवल (सेवार घास) के संसर्ग से भी होती है। भाव यह कि सुन्दर वस्तु सब काल में सुन्दर रहती है।

** (d)** जब ब्रह्मचारी ने पार्वती से कहा कि शङ्कर के मा बाप का पता नहीं तथा उनके विषय में अलक्ष्यजन्मता कहा तब पार्वती ने उत्तर दिया कि जो शङ्कर ब्रह्मा के भी जन्मदाता हैं उनके जन्म का पता भला कैसे हो सकता है। कोई उनके जन्म का पता कैसे जान सकता है।

 **4.** Kalidasa is one of the most brilliant jewels in the diadem of goddess Saraswati and he is unquestionably the best poet of Sanskrit literature. His style is simple, pure and chaste. It is brief as well as clear. The language blooms without interruption and long Compounds, involved construction and difficult puus are absentfrom it. It is easy but not without due ornamentation.

 यदा फलं पूर्वतपः समाधिना न तावता लभ्यममंस्तकाङ्क्षितम् तदानपेक्ष्य श्वशरीरमार्दवम् तपो महत्सा चरितुं प्रचक्रमे।

 He does not use redundant particles or useless words to complete the number of syllables prescribed. for a stanza.

 One distinctive feature of **कालिदास'**s poetry is his love of nature. His descriptive powers are remarkable and while describing nature he strikes us as a part and parcel of it. He ascribes human feelings and even actions to iuaminate objects of nature which makes the scene very effective.

 शिलाशयां तामनिकेतवासिनीं, निरन्तरास्वन्तरवातवृष्टिषु व्यलोकयन्तुन्मिषितैस्तडिन्मयैर्महातपः साक्ष्य इव स्थिताः क्षपाः।

 His poetry is also profusely interspersed with universal truths.

 **(1)** न कामवृत्तिर्वचनीयमीक्ष्यते

** (2)** न रत्नमन्विष्यति मृग्यते हि तत्



** (3)** क ईप्सितार्थस्थिरनिश्चयं मनः पयश्च निम्नाभिमुखं प्रतीपयेत्।

 There is more passion in the thoughts of **भवभूति** than in those of **कालिदास;** but less fancy. There are few of the elegant similitudes in which the latter is so rich and there is more that is commonplace and much whien is strained and obscure, **भवभूति** expatiates more largely in the description of human emotions and is perhaps entitled to even a higher place than his rival as a poet.

 For the execution of **उत्तरचरित** especially the 3rd and 6th Acts **भवभूति** is greatly indebted to **कालिदास भवभूति** followed thoughts, ideas and images from **कालिदास।** **कालिदास** is suggestive while **भवभूति** is descriptive; **कालिदास** strikes the keynote and leaves the rest to be supplied by the imaginative power of the reader. But **भवभूति** delights in giving a detailed description and leaves no room for the play of the imaginative power of the reader. **कालिदास** often compares one concrete thing with another concrete thing; **भवभूति** on the other hand often indulges in comparing concrete objects with abstract ideas with the result that his similes are stiff and do not appeal directly to the hearts of the readers. But in the description of the Sublime grandeur of nature and of the heroes of a battlefield and in analysing human emotions he is superior to **कालिदास।**
