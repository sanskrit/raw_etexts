**PREFACE.  
![](../books_images/U-IMG-172121436514.png)**

 The plot of this work is the well-known story of Dhruva so beautifully narrated in the thrilling chapters of Bhagavata.It is briefly summarised below.

 King Uttanapada had two wives, Suneeti and Suruchi. He married the latter with the consent of the senior queen, under the fascinating spell of her personal charms. He was attached to both, but his attachment to the younger amounted to an absolute devotion. He indulged in the wildest dreams of domestic happiness when entering on this second wedding.

 From his knowledge of the senior lady's virtues and devotion, and from his idea of the junior queen's loves and charms, he allowed himself to indulge in dreams of unprecedented bliss.

 Suneeti had given willing consent,nay,had even shown alacrity—when the king had proposed to take a second partner; for,her sublime ideal of duty enjoined her not to thwart her husband in his wishes,however unwelcome they might be to her own.

 Thus Suruchi became installed in her new home under circumstances that enabled her to acquire and exercise unlimited domination.She brought with her a toilette servant,Manthara by name,to act for her in any capacity according to emergencies,a spy,a tale-bearer,a fellow-conspirator and what not.This Manthara at first tried to sow dissensions between the two ladies by exasperating the feelings of Suneeti and rousing her jealousy at her super-



cession by a rival.But the wicked arts of Manthara failedaltogether of effect.She next addressed herself to herown true mistress.

 The king's prime minister was Sumati by name,a large-hearted man and the elder brother of Suneeti the senior queen. To enjoy the honeymoon of the new wedding and possibly to snatch a few days' rest and holiday,the king resolved to make his Prime-Minister a temporary regent.The minister protested in vain against the king's decision as capable of misconstruction and as quite uncalled for under the circumstances.Thus it transpired that the king retired from office and the minister was installed in royalty.

 While thus in the enjoyment of domestic bliss, t so chanced that both Suruchi and Suneeti besought the king to visit their chambers one night.The king found himself in a dilemma. Suruchi's epistle of love was couched in flowing language of impassioned amour,and the senior queen wrote only a few lines of sober and simple request.king resolved to grant the senior's request and did so.

 The The next day Suruchi and Manthara discussed the situation.Fired by jealousy,disappointed at the turn that affairs were supposed to be taking,infuriated by the king's neglect,and dreading the ascendency which the senior queen was supposed to be regaining,Suruchi appealed to Manthara for advice,and this was proffered to her in the shape of the most bitter incitement towards hostility.Stress was laid on the king's abdication of the throne; calumny was freely availed of;an utterly false representation was made of the king's words and demeanour at the time that Suruchi's love letter was delivered to him — in short,Manthara worked on the feelings of Suruchi so dexterously that between the two



it was soon resolved that the senior queen should be expelled from the palace into the forest forthwith.

 Shortly after,Suruchi interviewed the king.It was a stormy acrimonious meeting.On an innocent man who was simply an imbecile under the spell of Suruchi's charms,the wickedestweapons of malice and jealousy were employed with the most deadly effect.The result was that Suneeti the senior queen was exiled into the forest to return to the palace no more.

 Time passed and the glamour of love faded a bit.The king felt the want of male issue as all Hindu fathers keenly do. Priests advised penance in a forest,and he left accordingly to worship Hari.After an arduous course of penances,Hari appeared before him and presented unto him in gratification of the king's desire, a single mango fruit with the injunction that it should be eaten entire by his queen.

 The king returned to his capital with the fruit and resumed the royal duties.He sent the fruit to Suruchi,with instructions to eat it entire.But the lady was too proud to do so.She would not eat the nut.She had little faith in the efficacy of supernatural boons and the heretical reflections of the woman in waiting,Manthara,were not calculated to improve her faith.The result was that she ate only the soft parts of the fruit and cast away the hard nut.The minister Sumati seized the rejected nut and gave it to his sister Suneeti in the forest,without however apprising her of its efficacy.As time wore on, both conceived.The event was fraught with the keenest pang to Suneeti.She could not make out how it was.A visit by her husband was imperatively needed to silence the scandal.Suruchi's party already began to set the tongue of scandal in motion.The prudent Sumati averted the calamity and



it was arranged that the king should halt in Suneeti's forest-residence for a night in the course of a hunting expedition.

 In due time, the two ladies gave birth to a son each.Dhruva was born of Suneeti and Uttama of Suruchi.The former was a magnificent boy,and the latter was only a bag of boneless flesh,because of the serious distaste evinced by his mother in partaking of the supernatural fruit.

 The birth of Dhruva,the resplendent child,created quite a flutter in the wicked counsels of Suruchi and Manthara.A diabolical plot was soon hatched to murder him with poison.Manthara repaired to the forest with poisoned viands and beguiled the child therewith,offering also many a handsome toy with them.The guileless Suneeti was deceived and Manthara departed in the belief that the boy's destruction would soon be an accomplished fact.She little knew that whereas man proposes, it is god that disposes. Scarcely had she left the premises, when a pack of fierce hounds attacked her and bit off her leg.She dropped the rest of the viands she had,and the poor dogs that devoured it died forthwith. The news was reported to Suneeti, at once, and the boy was saved just on the point of eating the poisoned gifts of the assassin.

 Two more years went by, and Dhruva grew up a fine boy, and at five he looked exquisitely charming. One day he besought his mother to let him go to his royal father. Suneeti consented and sent the boy with a nurse to the palace. The king and Suruchi were in the court,and the boy and the nurse were admitted to the Royal presence. With innate dignity and majesty, the boy approached the throne to claim a seat on the lap of the king. His step-mother Suruchi fiercely interrupted and forbade him. She said he was unworthy to mount on the royal lap; for, he was not born of divine grace. She fiercely exhorted the



child to seek Narayana's grace, before he could audaciously mount the royal throne. Her words darted like shafts into his heart and were firmly imbedded there.The king kept silent.The boy writhed in agony, especially because the words cast a reflection on his mother's godly virtues. He darted from the place and sped into the forest to meet Narayana the God and secure his grace.

 Sore were his trials in the dense darkness of the jungle, but he was sincerely in quest of God; and his wild appeals invoking the Almighty were not in vain. The sage Narada turned up on the scene with the divine lute. The boy fell at his feet and implored the sage to initiate him into the truths Divine. He would accept no suggestions to retrace his way homeward,and was firm in his resolution to tread the path of Heaven. Narada yielded and conferred on him the occult teachings of spiritual emancipation.

 A transformation occurred at once. The boy turned his face to Heaven. His thoughts were upward bent. He recollected the sins and sufferings undergone by him in the course of births innumerable, and entered on a course of penances, rigid and austere, in order to get a personal vision of the Almighty. We leave him to his Tapas for thepresent.

 No sooner were the steps of Dhruva out of sight, than the king felt an inexpressible pang shoot through his heart. His queen Suruchi also felt a dread of hypnotic mesmerism such as frogs are said to feel before the blazing eyes of a cobra on the eve of becoming its prey. She felt the eyes of Dhruva still upon her, and the torture following in the wake of an outraged conscience tortured her all the night through.

 The king consulted the minister the next day and was getting nearly heart-broken. He was disgusted with



both his wives; for he was still prejudiced against the senior wife. But the truth was soon to be unmasked before his eyes. In an outburst of conscience,Suruchi rushed to the king and made a clean breast of her sins to him. The wicked Manthara who had lingered so long from the bite of dogs, sent up to the king a dying declaration of her wicked acts and a vivid delineation of Suneeti's chastity and good-ness.The king's eyes were opened. He felt as at no time he had felt before, the appalling cruelty of his conduct in exiling a chaste queen and a matchless son.The gods themselves declared by an unseen voice in the heavens, that he had good reason to be thoroughly ashamed of himself. On hearing the words, the Kshatriya's wrath was roused for a moment. He rose in anger,but the brain could support the strain no longer.

 For months the king was thrown into a bed of serious illness. It was a nervous prostration brought on by the rush of blood into the brain. In his delirium, he raved about Suneeti and Dhruva. Suruchi became alarmed and sent for Suneeti to return to the Palace, having delayed for three months the despatch of the royal order cancelling her exile. Suneeti returned home and took up her position by the bed of the invalid. Her presence and voice at once effected a mesmeric change towards convalescence. When the king recovered consciousness,a touching scene followed, in which the king poured out a heartrending longing to- wards the absent son. Suneeti pacified her excited lord, and wound up by showing her remarkably high soul in begging the king to let bygones be bygones and pardon the junior queen Suruchi for ever as if nothing had occurred.

 It was In the jungles Dhruva continued his penance. so terribly fierce as to cause the Earth and Heavens to quake. The Devas became alarmed and wished to see



it stopped. Emissaries came from the skies and tried persuasion in vain. Dhruva was determined to push on with Tapas till he got emancipation from mortal bondage. Matali and Nandi, the messengers of Indra and Rudra,approached him, and he prayed Rudra to obtain for him an interview with Vayu. Vayu appeared and gave Dhruva, as Armed a boon, an enduring faith in and devotion to Hari. with such a faith he prayed to God to bestow on him the grace of a personal vision. Young Krishna responded to the call. Dhruva was enveloped in an ecstatic rapture of devotion and poured forth prayers of a surcharged heart. The Lord was pleased and proposed to confer any boon Dhruva might wish. Stunned by the excitement of the situation, Dhruva felt his tongue paralysed and left God to give what he chose. The Lord willed that Dhruva should be a throned monarch of the skies and reign fixedly as the Pole-Star.

 The penance of Dhruva thus came to an end. Engaged in the per- with other boys in the hermitage of a great sage formance of holy rites and worship, he was discovered by his uncle Sumati the minister. A telling appeal by Sumati with special emphasis laid on the maternal griefs of Suneeti took effect. The boy at last consented to return home. Sumati, Dhruva and Narada, returned to the palace, and the sage Narada restored to the king, his pride and joy. Affectionate greetings and a universal rejoicing conclude the Drama.

 I have endeavoured in this work to lay stress on some of the cardinal tenets of the Vedantic theology as expounded man, the by Sri Madhwacharya. The duality of God and reality of differences,the supremacy of godhead, the law of sins and punishment, all this I have tried to illustrate here and there.



An implicit observance of all the Sanskrit rules regulating Dramatic compositions has not been attempted. None of the Dramatis Personaespeak in Prakrit. The reason for not introducing Prakrit is chiefly this–that the Prakrit is not studied now even by men of scholarly attainments. A Sanskrit rendering has invariably to be appended to it, and therefore the prakrit portions are mostly surplusage.

 Ancient Dramas do not seem to have adopted the English plan of distinct scenes to develop and set forth the plot of each act. In Sakuntala, for instance, each act is one continuous scene, in which actors come and go no doubt, but the stage is not wholly cleared of actors to give place to a wholly different scene of action and a different set of players. In this work, the English method of sharply-defined scenes is introduced as subdivisions in every act.

 Without attempting anya flights of rhetoric or imagination, I have endeavoured to rewrite an old pathetic story with as few embellishments as the exigencies of the stage seemed to necessitate. It is an humble contribution to literature, made in the hope and belief that any contribution however poor may be welcome at this critical juncture of its history—the Renaissance of Indian learning.

**DHRUVA'S PENANCE.**

**ACT 1.**

 May that Krishna, the adored deity of Bhâratee's Lord,—whose foot-lotus is the dwelling of Fortune—who is adorned with the valued gems of attributes culled from the Ocean of Sri Madhwa's Scriptures—who has been adored by prominent poets like Bhavabhuti and others of manifold orders in diverse tongues and forms—and who elevated Dhruva humiliated by the king, to his own true position, greatly pleased by his devotion, protect us and grant to us an inspired knowledge of the nine poetic emotions.

  Oh Krishna, the abode of grace, the hero of the teachings of Poorna-Pragna, do thou protect me Padmanabha born in Soudha family—one who reposes trust ardently in the pair of thy lotus-feet forever— who is plunged in the sea of samsara and is afflicted.

 The Ocean of sciences being limitless,is incapable of being crossed by people of limited intellect; learned men naturally adorned with patience and forgiveness are full of condescension. Omniscience and infallibility are neither of them attributes of humanity; my prostration is rendered always to the learned, as that destroys sins:

 At the end of the benediction—the Manager—looking behind the scenes.

**Manager**:—Sir, is everything ready?  
**Actor**:—Sir,Ready under your orders.  
**Manager**:—The gathering is full, adorned with learned men of acknowledged worth. Let the Dramatis Personæ please the learned men with songs as sweet to hear as ambrosia is to taste with gesticulated action deep with import—with pleasure-giving Aestheties-with the soothing quintessence of imagi- nation and rhetoric. Let all of you do service with agreeable and tender speeches—so, with a variegated display of curtains and a pleasant assortment of scenes.

**Vidhushaka**:—I entertain some doubt regarding the taste in music, of the numerous men forming this assembly.

They having studied the English Language, and adopted foreign systems of thought, dislike the sacred shastras, proud of additions to their name: degree letters such as B. L. Alas! the sweet essence of music is arrow to their ears and molten lead; and dancing, especially of courtesans, is nauseating to them; these members of your assembly are verily men void of taste.

**Manager**:—Friend, do not censure intelligent persons.That music is indeed no music, which,being sung by unemotional persons having only a knowledge of music as a science, consists of a loud noise, a howl accompanied by a distorted countenance and shaken limbs (hands and feet); A repetition of mispronounced words jarring to the ear and conveying no sense, to the accompaniment of sa. ri. ga. -ma. is not at all music worthy of regard ; and this, these sensible people boldly denounce.

They would certainly appreciate highly the Music that is pregnant with meaning and is sung by a sweet voice.

**Actor**—With the aid of what work, are they to be entertained? These find fault even with authors like Magha and Bhavabhuti, that they are poets guilty of exaggeration.

**Manager**.—By one who, having had English Education knows the tastes of the assembly, a new drama (Trotaka) has been composed. It may be acceptable to the learned, full, as they are, of forgiveness. Moreover, even among those paying little regard, generally speaking, for duties laid down by antiquity, there is now clearly seen a new-born appreciation of narrations contained in writings such as Bhagavata. The present is a story (of Bhagavata) of one pre-eminent among the devotees of the lord. It sets forth how

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dhruva the royal sage, of meritorious character,abandoned the transitory course of life in the pleasure rooms of a great King, and, plunging deep into the waters of Yoga in an inaccessible forest, saw face to face the ornament of the Yadu race, saw the charming smiling face of Lakshmi's Lord who, adored by the hymns of the Devas, forms a Kalpa tree of the faithful—worshipped the august son of Nanda in person, danced before him, shed torrents of joyful tears and became blessed by the attainment of a position in the heavens. By acting incidents like these on the stage, entertain the gathering. Such is the wish of all.

**Actor**.— Sir, we will endeavour to the best of our capacity to please the assembly.  
**Manager**.—By that, good people will be satisfied, misled by partiality; like this King Uttanapada enchanted by his second (wife.)

**Scene I. In the Palace.**  
Then enter King and Suruchi.

**King**.— Dear, is the husband's house comfortable?  
**Suruchi**.— Here there is every means of happiness. But this town does not suit my health.  
**King**.— Being new, it seems so. This is your harem, this is its master. This is the bed room, this, the place of water sports—the flower-garden. Dear, if the servants, door-keepers, house-hold guards, messengers, and persons like the hairdresser, misbehave towards you in the least, tell me immediately and I will punish, the very moment.

 **कलादः**—देव, बहुशस्सन्नद्धानि। परन्त्वीषत्परिष्कृतिमपेक्षन्ते।

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
**Suruchi**.— Your Majesty, the goldsmith has not yet brought the jewels. I know not the cause of  
delay.  
**King**.— Look here, Sirrah, bring the goldsmith at once with the jewels.  
**Door-keeper.**— As your Majesty commands.

\[Exit Servant.

**King**.— Whatever is desired, my dear, I will give it to you that very moment, O you sportless one. Now I will fetch you even the tiger's milk from the mountain top.

\[Enter servant with the goldsmith.

**King**.—Sirrah goldsmith, where are the jewels ?  
**Goldsmith**.—Your Majesty, they are almost ready, but they require a little polish.



** सुरुचिः** — दर्शय तानि।  
**कलादः** —इयमुरस्सूत्रिका, प्रालम्बिका, ललाटिका, मेखला, इमे कर्णिके, इमावावाप-कौ, इदं केयूरं पादांगुदं।  
 **राजा**— त्वरया परिष्कृतानि भवन्तु।

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Suruchi**.— Shew them.  
**Goldsmith**.— Here is the necklace of pearls, the long gold necklace, the jewel of the forehead, here the belt, here are the earrings, these the bangles, this is the armlet, toe-ring.  
**King**.— Let them be done up soon.  
**Goldsmith**.— As your Majesty commands. \[Exeunt.

**Scene II. In the Ladies' chamber, Palace.**

Enter Suneeti and Manthara.

**Suneeti**.— Friend, what is the cause of this troubled countenance? I infer, it may be a longing for an absent husband or a disagreement with him.



 **मन्थरा** —बाढं, सम्यगूहितं तत्रभवत्या, द्वितीयस्तावन्मे खेदमुत्पादयति। प्रार्थनीयः स्यात्खलु प्रथमः।

 **मन्थरा** —नैतादृशो मे पतिः।

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Manthara**.—Yes, well inferred by your ladyship. It is the second that causes me trouble. The first is indeed to be wished for. Want of food and raiment I do not mind at all. A highly incommodious house is no matter of concern to me. The misconduct of an idle husband, his jarring words, and the affairs of a neglected household are so many permanent shafts imbedded in my heart.

**Suneeti**.— Anger is born out of anger; and love grows out of love. It is you that I consider to  
blame, as the cause of your husband's distemper.



**दशति रदनपङ्क्तीर्नित्यसंबद्धकुभ्रू

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

**Manthara**.— Not thus is my husband. He bites the rows of teeth with eyebrows ever knit ; and is by nature harsh in language, with arms intent on striking. Having no moisture within his heart, he distresses me much, me that am sorely troubled in mind and exhausted in body, by constant attention to house-hold work.

**Suneeti**.— What is the good of married life in the absence of (mutual) affection. In sweet music such as of veena, the melody consists in the concord of tune and time. In the lotus, its loveliness lies in the proper combinatian of fragrance with a roseate hue. In the King, (his) greatness is seen when grace is united with power. That house-hold is blessed where harmony prevails between the husband and the wife.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Therefore follow my advice. Let me see how a firm affection is not established between you both. At dawn, a holy singing, then, a course of toilette, decorations of the hair and the face, a pious service at the feet of Sri (Lakshmi) with an humble and pious meditation of Hari's feet, a conversation with touching tenderness, kindness towards attendants, an eagerness to do what is good, whichever virtuous woman should possess these qualities, succeeds in her (husband's) house.

**Manthara**.— (Dressing the hair) Madam, for a long time, I wished to ask you how it was that permission was given by your ladyship for the second marriage of the lord the king, yourself of such extraordinarily charming features, being alive.



**सासूया भवति प्रिया प्रियतमे कान्तान्यशङ्कास्पदे

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

A wife becomes jealous if the dearest one is at all suspected about a stranger-lady. Every woman exhibits reddened eyes ifher husband be devoted to a co-wife. Except you, I certainly know not of any virtuous woman in the world who would yield willing consent to her husband with alacrity for his marrying (again).

**Suneeti**.— Friend, your mother invariably feels immersed in joy, is it not, if the attainment of a desired object occurs to you. At the gratification of a friend, pleasure results to us owing to friendship. Is it then a wonder (for me) to be delighted at the joys of a beloved husband.



** मन्थरा**—

**मोदते हि जनो लोके स्वार्थबुध्यैव सर्वदा।

 **सुनीतिः** — हले, नसर्वोऽपिलोक एवमेव।

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Manthara**.— In the world, a person rejoices as a rule from a selfish consideration, as men rejoice at the luxuriance of a plantation in expectation of their own profit.

**Suneeti**.— Friend, the whole world is not like this. On a fine clear day, the lotus here below smiles at the sight of the sun. Likewise all creatures are comforted to see a delighted countenance. In the world, there are pious men rendering service to all out of pure disinterestedness, like the King Sibi, viewing the joys of everybody as their own. Similarly there are others sinful and despicable who grieve and pine away at the joys of a neighbour and are jaundiced in body owing to an envious disposition.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

**Manthara**.— Notwithstanding all this, O, you spotless one, that wife is rare who loves a co-wife. What woman will strive for her own ruin in order to secure happiness to a rival.

**Suneeti**.—This is not for the happiness of the co-wife ; but the woman who strives for the happiness of the husband always befriends, for the sake of the husband, one who is the object of his affections just as she does, his circle of relations.

**Manthara**.— Madam, no doubt your words are reasonable. But I know not that there ever was friendship anywhere like yours towards Suruchi.

**Suneeti**.— Our lord Hari residing in Vaikuntta glories with a couple of wives ; Kunti and Madri (wives) of Pandu vied with each other in courting death. This virtuous and beautiful lady, my Suruchi of spotless figure and heavenly light, possesses every good quality, and is fit to enjoy sovereignty as the pet of Fortune's dalliance.  
**Manthara**.— (Finishing the toilette,) May good always befall you, virtuous-hearted as you  
are. I go to attend on Surichi (so she starts.)  
**Suneeti**.— Friend, this letter has to be despatched to His Majesty.  
**Manthara**.— I will carry it without delay to His Majesty.

**Scene III. Durbar Hall.**

Enter King, Sumati (minister) and Vidhushaka.

**King**.— Sumati, we know well how appropriate is your name. Are the Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaisyas, and Sudras, happy in the fulfilment of the duties and conduct belonging to their  
caste and order.

**Sumati**.— Under your Majesty's sway, all the subjects pursue a straightforward course, are blessed with wealth of every kind, and are happy.  
**King**.—Friend, for a long time, by constant attention day after day, to the anxious duties of a sovereign, we feel exhausted ; we wish for some rest. Having an excellent and intelligent

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

minister like you what occasion is there for concern ? So thinking, we felt satisfied that there would be no harm in laying the burden of the kingdom upon you.  
**Vidhushaka**.— (To himself). The king forsakes the kingdom under the spell of a damsel's eye. Rest is however difficult for him to obtain (tossed) between two fine lasses.  
**Sumati**.— Let my lord think it over well. O king, youth shines in your person ; the lustre is indeed divine. There is not a streak of grey in the hair of the head nor such in the whiskers ; Alas ! would not people say that a brave warrior is sporting within the palace having abandoned his duty ? My heart is sick to think of it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your majesty, I am only a servant ; my lord's commands are to be obeyed.  
**Vidhushaka**.— The minister falters and hesitates to speak out clearly. A double sovereignty leads to the ruin of a country. Two doctors accomplish the patient's death. Two lawyers cause a client's ruin, and two wives, the destruction of a husband.  
**King**.— All the affairs of the world are governed by an alternate succession of pleasure and pain waking and sleeping. Sleep after fatigue is a feature common to all sentient creation. Hence we shall be doing nothing blameable at all by this. Be watchful and as our repre-

**Sumati**.—I feel honoured.\[Exit.  
**Vidhushaka**.— 0 ! king, you have lifted down the burden of the kingdom from your shoulders. Hereafter, I presume that your endeavour is, by spending time in the studies of Vedic philosophy to your heart's content and indulging in the reveries of a wholesale renunciation, to become a  ‘Rajarshi' and then a 'Bramharshi' like Viswamitra.

**King**.— Friend, who then is the Vasishta to confer on me the title of    'Bramharshi'.

**Vidhushaka**.—I am an eminent Brahmin. Like Vasishta I will give you the diploma.  
**King**.—Friend, I am not an old man yet, nor one whose limbs have shrunk, or whose mouth has lost the teeth, so as to be qualified for commencing an inquiry into Vedanta. Verily it is they that are qualified for it. (Vedanta).  
**Vidhushaka**.—Then what is the reason for abdicating office ; Oh ! the abandonment of the kingdom is probably for the purpose of accepting judicial duty as the arbiter of the criminal and civil litigation cropping out of the double marriage.

Having deposited all authority and dignity in the minister, you are freed from a host of troubles, from the torments (bitings) of pub-

lic affairs. But who is indeed the judge that wields the rod of authority inside your house, in respect to the quarrels of both your wives ?  
**King**.— What is the reason for quarrel ; my wives are the ornaments of the harem. Eyes and ears that exist in pairs don't quarrel with each other. It is a matter of world-wide renown that the Aswins don't quarrel, physicians though they are:  
**Vidhushaka**.— Friend, is Suruchi a beautiful woman ?  
**King**.— She is a combination of all that is lovely calculated to enchant the 3 worlds.  
**Vidhushaka**.— Have you heard that a beautiful wife is in truth a foe ? I read it "a junior wife that is beautiful is a formidable foe."

King, know that many are the men ruined by their junior wives —They have melted away (dissolved) like sugar by the tears shed by the first-wedded ones.  
**King**.— Friend, whence is this great knowledge of practical philosophy ! Madhavya, have you an acquaintance with palmistry.  
**Vidhushaka**— Rare indeed is any science unknown to me.  
**King**.—Then tell me if this horoscope (life) is blessed with sons or not. \[So shows his palm.  
**Vidhushaka**.— Bitter poison from the tooth of the hooded serpent, sharpness from the blade of the sword, hardheartedness from plague and

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

long-enduring revengefulness from the mind of the elephant—verily by combining these together the creator formed the heart of a stepmother a personification of wickedness ; therefore, eminent king, a son is not to be desired if you have any attachment to life.  
**King**.— You are altogether mistaken. I do not fear such a disaster in my house. My virtuous ladies entertain equal affection for me.  
**Vidhushaka**. — Excuse me, that I state the truth though it be unpleasant.

 Do not render homage to women ! do not O ! king of the globe ! The worship of women is tainted with the sins of kali and becomes the wicked alone, O king of the globe.

A single dame hung round the neck, will kill a man, O Lord of the globe.

द्यदि चरति दया ते भक्तिपूर्णे कलत्रे।**

Gently blows the wind, cool and moist, stirring up the flame of youth. The prince of bees sings within the Jasmine flowers in the hair of my head.

With a sportive display of heavy jewelry, the damsels charmingly clad, are singing away under the mango tree, a welcome song to Love (Cupid-mind-born). My lord, we are tied together in our subtle bodies by love, with of lotus-thread. The prowess of ropes Spring and Cupid combined, makes the bondage of lotus-thread strong as thunderbolt.

Come to our chambers ; your beloved lady waits, steeped in infatuation. Obstructed as you may be, still save me O ! king ; the full moon shines at night.

**Suneeti's Letter.**

Should there be any leisure snatched in the discharge of royal duties ; if any tenderness be spared for a wife filled with attachment,

then I, your fond wife approach you, my noble preceptor, friend, god, and saviour, with a respectful prayer for a visit (an interview).  
**Vidhushaka**.— Between these two respected ladies, how do you dispose of yourselves.  
**King**— Under these circumstances, if I be partial to the younger one I may incur censure 'that the man was beguiled by amorous language' ; I go to Suneeti's apartments.

\[Exeunt.

**(Act I.) Scene IV.**

In the flower garden, Enter Suruchi (on a bed of flowers) and Manthara.

**Manthara**.— Madam, is the breeze of the moist fan

 **सुरुचिः**— कथं स्यात्सुखस्वापः अत्यन्तदौर्भाग्यपीडिताया मे।

 **सुरुचिः** —कथमेतदूह्यते।

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

comfortable ? I presume that there was no sound sleep over-night. What is the cause  
of the indisposition.  
**Suruchi**.— How could there be sound sleep to me afflicted as I am by gross misfortune ?  
**Manthara**.— The evil be averted ! Your exalted grace posssesses such a blessed name that one has to wash one's mouth many times with water before pronouncing it. How can misfortune approach one who confers fortune on the world as if poverty should visit the goddess of wealth (Lakshmi).  
**Suruchi**— Woman, where is my royal husband ?  
**Manthara**.— How do I know. He must be by the side of Suneeti.  
**Suruchi**.— How is this inferred ?



** मन्थरा**—तन्मे रहस्यं न प्रकटीकरोमि।  
 **सुरुचिः**— अयि हण्डे नन्वददाः पत्रिकां मे आर्यपुत्रस्यैव हस्ते॥स्वीचकार किल तां सः।

 **सुरुचिः**—समापय वाक्यं किं ददर्शिथ तत्र भवति मदनभिमतं।  
 **मन्थरा** —

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Manthara**.—That is my secret ; I won't reveal it.  
**Suruchi**.— You wench, did you deliver the letter into the hands of my husband direct ? He received it, did he not ?  
**Manthara**.— No doubt, he received it but (stops short).  
**Suruchi**.— Finish the sentence ; what did you see in the honoured personage hostile to me ?  
**Manthara**.—Talebearing is highly detestable and truly do I avoid it always like poison : I do not wish to publish what in secret manifested itself many times between them : No doubt, my friendship induces me to expose their conduct. You are a guileless woman and their wile is so blameable.

**सापत्न्यं पतिभार्ययोस्तदथवा पत्न्योः क्वचिद्रोषतो  
मन्तव्यं न चिरंतनं हि सुरुचे मध्यस्थितैस्सेवकैः।**

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Suruchi**.— Woman, so far as I am concerned, there is no room for suspicion that it may be talebearing. From fear of tale-telling, if you keep silent, then what say you to this that you become a violator of trust.

After studying long your skill in acting as a spy I brought you as a dowry from my father's house to the husband's : You having acted as a spy for a long time, how came about this highly meritorious resolve ? Wench, by association with her, ingratitude has been learnt in truth :

**Manthara**.— May your grace not be offended !

Disagreement between a husband and a wife or again between rival co-wives arising sometimes from anger, should not be viewed as



**किं तन्मे यदि लेखनं तव पतिर्धिक्कृत्य तत्पत्रिकां  
स्वीचक्रे च मुहुस्तुतोष भरितः प्रीत्या चुचुंबाशु तां॥ ३७॥**

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

enduring, O ! Suruchi, by strangers and subordinates : what is it to me if your husband despised the letter, accepted her epistle and kissed it at once many a time out of love filled with joy :

**Suruchi**.— Woman, what is it to you, if drawing pay month after month, you be allowed to go about as you please, neglecting the service I wish you to perform. Clear out at once from my house. I did not know that you were of this stuff :

**Manthara**.— My words were prompted only by fear. Your rival is not an ordinary person ;  
**Suruchi**.— What harm could she do to you while I am here the beloved consort of the emperor.  
**Manthara**.— True, a consort ; as to 'beloved' ,there is however a doubt.



 **सुरुचिः** —कथमिदं ज्ञातं त्वया। उच्यतामविलंबं।  
 **मन्थरा** —

**लेखं दृष्ट्वा विकृतवदनतस्तैलपानादिवासौ

** सुरुचिः**—जहास किल। धिगस्वाश्चर्या।

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Suruchi**.— How was this ascertained by you ? Let it be mentioned without delay.  
**Manthara**.— On seeing the writing, his face became wry as if he had swallowed oil ; he squeezed and threw down this letter with great contempt. In ridicule he revealed the contents of the letter to her ; she laughed that the cunning words of an amorous lady (i.e. yourself) proved fruitless.  
**Suruchi**.— She laughed, did she ? fie upon her conduct !  
I will convert her tears of laughter and merriment into weeping. I will make her wash her hands with the tears of her eyes. She of low passions said, is it not ? of me that I was amorous. I will release the elated woman soon from every enjoyment

derivable from a husband :  
**Manthara**.— Madam, this vow is vain ; it may lead to disaster ; withdraw the resolve, being impossible of fulfilment.  
**Suruchi**.— Time will prove it ; what did my husband say under the circumstances ?  
**Manthara**.— Nothing ; The king praised the writing of the rival queen and used language quite revolting to you. That charming lady became giddy with arrogance and elated as the chief queen whose sentiments were appreciated by the beloved.  
**Suruchi**.— (manifests anguish and thinking).  
(In another part of the flower garden aman and woman disappeared among the creepers).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Manthara**.— Was it heard by your grace, the rustle of dress and leaves among the creeper branches of the blooming arbour ? Look, they are resting at the foot of the mango-tree in the ecstasy of private conversation though the sun is shining bright in the sky.  
**Suruchi**.— That Suneeti is indeed a courtesan; no virtuous woman will in broad day-light thus indulge in amorous sport.How is it that without being occupied in royal duties he has got the leisure to play with women ?  
**Manthara**.— It is surprising that it is not known to your grace. The kingdom was in fact entrusted with the minister, the brother of Suneeti, only yesterday, at her instigation ; I got this information from Madhavya with



पांतरेषु निशम्य वार्तां निवेदयामि (इति गत्वा कतिपयनिमिषानन्तरं न्यवर्तत।)

difficulty and by tact ; let your lady-ship remain here. I will bring news after hiding myself among the trees and listening. (so going, she returned a fer minutes later).  
**Suruchi**.—Friend, what was it seen or heard by you ?  
**Manthara**.— On a fresh bed strewn with flowers, abundantly served by all the attendants, lies the tender woman, bright with the lustre of youth, reclining on a fine pillow furnished by the soft thigh of her husband. The senior queen is a highly blessed lady shining and amorous ; there she is, immersed in a limitless ocean of joy, her heart's wishes fully gratified. They have bent their thoughts upon sports arranging a water excursion. They

propose visiting the banks of Yamuna for playing on sand, in the moonlight. Numerous balls have been secured for the bevy of damsels to play with. If without invitation you wish to see, you may go.  
**Suruchi**.— (Furious) you seem to direct that going uninvited when the young women may be playing at night, I am to wash their clothes as their washerwoman or cleanse the floor as their maid-servant. Wench, don't add insult to injury (pour brine into an ulcer). I do not understand what should be done now. I know your clear head in such matters. Say, — what had better be done.  
**Manthara**.— Iwill tell you if you stand surety for my life.  
**Suruchi**.— I do, what doubt is there ?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Manthara**.— I think you must carry out your resolve. The banishment of Suneeti should be accomplished if you possess the King's favour.  
**Suruchi**.— Let me see how this is difficult to attain.

Exeunt.

**Scene V. palace.**  
(Enter King and Suruchi.)

**King**.— Dear, I became sleepless last night, disturbed by a bad dream. I suddenly woke up and asked Suneeti who slept by my side. She pacified me saying that it meant nothing and lay down again. I ask you as you are so ready-witted.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Suruchi**. — (with jealousy) Is my intelligence clearer than even that of Suruchi ? Is my presence more agreeable to my royal husband than that of Suneeti ? Am I a lawfully wedded wife like Suneeti ! Better ask Suneeti again. There is indeed nothing beyond the reach of her intellect.  
**King**.—Dear, what is this volley of harsh utterances ? Has anything occurred of significance ?  
**Suruchi**.— Any incident of note that happened in secrecy must be entirely within the knowledge of you both. How do I know of the soft whispers poured into the ears of your highly beloved consort, behind the screen, in bed or in the flower garden ? Having all the five senses consumed by the heat of

separation and heaving deep sobs of grief, spent the night rolling about in bed from end to end.  
**King**.— I feel absolutely stunned!I feel no difference between you both. She is a womanpossessing every virtue, and you also — (is interrupted).  
**Suruchi**.— Cease, my lord, the eulogium of a rival wife in my presence :  
**King** — Dear, what is the cause of this language of jealousy ?  
**Suruchi**.— Is it proper, O king, to apply chunam (Calciate of lime) mercilessly to one eye while (applying) to the other an unguent soothing as butter ; what, alas, is the cause of this partiality ? what is the fault in me ? I do not perceive in your senior wife anything to win the distinction.

**King**.— Meeting, in the shape of two virtuous girls, a pair of parrots plumed in a variety of colours and singing away, I lodged them inside in a nest, in a vast and stately palace. Feeling anxious lest they should fly away from there, I then fixed them in my own mind where I am guarding them with constant attention just as men guard the pupil of the eye with their eyelids.

**Suruchi**.— I know the object of these diplomatic words. There no doubt was a time when out  
of infatuated sense I reposed trust in deceitful words. Alas!the pang !

**King**.— O! lovely lady, I deserve not this language pointed as a dart. I do not possess capacity  
to release myself from the bondage of your

**Suruchi**.— If this speech be true, how then is it that I am thus despised by you, and by her also, in this house.  
**King**.— In me there is not the slightest fault ; last night I forgot you, in the disturbance of mind caused by the fact that, though years have elapsed, I have not yet been blessed with a son.

The burdens of the land have been borne, and numbers of good men have had their grievances redressed by the great prowess of my arms. With sympathetic gratitude they invoke blessings on me. In this house of mine and yours, built of gold and gems, and

**Suruchi**.— By forgetting me, has the blessing of a son been attained ? My Lord, I have resolved to go to my father's house. Let permission be accorded. To dwell here is no longer becoming. I pray that no impediment be offered ; no il luck has so far attended our union. There is nothing inauspicious in my horoscope. Since my wedding, your prosperity has steadily increased. My father did not force me on you, my lord, his favourite daughter as I was. I will be a slave at your feet ; but an equal wife I will never serve even to save my life.

**King**.— You have not been placed at the service of Suneeti.  
**Suruchi**.— A pile of fire and a mass of ice may possibly be reconciled to one another. A good serpent and a rat may move about as friends. A person stricken with the darts of love may turn out a passionless ascetic. Even then we both cannot live together in your house.  
**King**— Say nothing about banishment: It is most awful :  
Her attachment is centred in me. She feels an extraordinary love : How is it possible for me to endure, with life, a separation from her.

**Suruchi**.— Then you both may live happily and for ever in the palace. This poor person of mine I will remove to my father's house, my lord.  
**King**.— I cannot endure your separation even for a moment.

What is the use of sovereignty or of an exalted position due to a combination of blessings ? What is the use of good looks, or alas, of youth itself with a halo of fresh lustre associated with a handsome form ? What is the good of tasteful dishes or of melting music exquisite with feeling, if,stricken with the dart of Cupid on your account, O slender lady, I feel roasted by sighs.

Lovely woman, without you, what shall I do in the apartments of the palace ? How can clouds govern the heavens in the absence of lightning.

**Suruchi**.— My exile or hers should be enjoined. Here-after a joint residence is utterly impossible !

**King**— Dearest lady, what will the world say of me if I abandon a virtuous senior queen ; Alas ! Everywhere on earth the king's duty is to punish the wicked ;- not to aim the shaft of edicts at the innocent.

**Suruchi**.— Then give me up. The domination of a rival wife, the disaffection of a husbaud, and his wily words wither me up every night when I lie in bed. The flowers of my head have faded. The gold bangles fall off loose. Abandon me one who being afflicted with grief has resolved to go.

**King**.— By means of affectionate and tender words and by sympathy, relieve an infatuated person whose heart is subdued by the nectar-flow of your lotus face. Say, what was done by her who is so foolish, to your dislike. I will impose any suitable punishment, madam, such as you may dictate.

**Suruchi**.— I have no power to recount her misdeeds. Let your majesty question the dressing-woman. She blusters with rage among the servants and rules the kitchens in person, in season and out. Me your lawful wife, she despises by words and gestures ; she struts about always heavy with jewelry with a swaggering display of the plaited braid. Your favourite of golden features is filled with conceit that her husband's will is at her command.

**Manthara**.— May victory befall your majesty.

**Manthara**.— Nothing.  
**Suruchi**.— (angrily) What is it ?  
**Manthara**.— (As if afraid) I do not wish to speak the truth in the presence of her offended ladyship. My lord, let the resignation of your slave be accepted.

The poor dressing-woman sorely troubled resigns her office under you. How is it possible to live here when such disagreement

What enchanting features, they, of slender Suruchi, reflecting a lustre that vanquishes the halo of heavenly nymphs ; what eyes languishing with love !!!  
**Manthara**.— Moreover, Suneeti appears to despise even your majesty. She boasts that all your fortune is due to her merits, and that she sleeps nowhere but on your soft lap (Interrupted).

**ACT II.  
Prelude.**

Enter Vidhushaka with Cheti (Manthara)

**Vidhushaka**.— Well, Manthara, is your mistress the junior queen Suruchi free from all cares, the senior having gone to the forest and her misfortune being thus banished from her. Moreover, being so lucky as to enjoy an undiminished flow of the royal favours is she not supremely blessed (happy ?)  
**Manthara**.— Her happiness turned out short-lived.  
**Vidhushaka**.— How is this ?  
**Manthara**.— Fancying the King to be a subservient horse enchained by her spell, she hastened

to seat herself audaciously on the shoulders of her master holding and controlling the reins. The horse proceeded a short distance, pacing as directed by her ; then it dealt kicks and fled fast away from all control jumping and biting to the woods.

**Vidhushaka**.— I do not understand the meaning of these words. Is not the King in the woman's apartments of the palace.

**Manthara**.— You had better search for your friend everywhere up to all the boundaries of the palace, the courtyard square, the temples, the storied porticos, arbours, harems and everywhere in corners ; similarly indoors outdoors, sidedoors, and inside too ; up on the loft, beneath the pavements and even in the rat holes ; you will not find the king.

**Manthara**.— A person abandons the house he dislikes, when it is visited by an owl. So does he, one infested with bugs. Why not then, a house infested by an accursed wife ?

**Manthara**.— This news was learnt by me from the mouth of Suruchi that His Majesty becoming somewhat indifferent to worldly pleasures and neglecting even her lady-ship a little went to the forest to worship Hari for the blessing of a son.

fumes are adorned in green garments consisting of fine new turf.  
The young deer with parts of young grass chewed, playing about with an ecstasy of bounds, offer to the king a hearty welcome, by means of side-glances with curved necks. The flowing river singing away by a gentle drop on the stones of the bed, softly invites the honoured king by the babblings of the current. Learning from Aruna's word, of the intended arrival of our lord, the sun has hurried himself (to appear at the scene) liberated from the bondage of the sea and the night.

Alas, having worshipped the great and faultless Hari of perfect attributes in a dense jungle for 2 years by means of incessant and severe austerities and then attaining a vision of Sreenath, the fountain of blessings, the infinite one of smiling face capable of conferring the moksha itself, I regret that I begged him, O ! Sumati, only for a son instead of final emancipation from mortal existence.  
**Sumati**.— After laying by, a store of piety and merit, through the instrumentality of an eminently righteous son, the qualification for moksha will follow.

**Suruchi**.— Will it bestow a son or a daughter or both ?  
**Manthara**.— It is said, only a son.  
**Suruchi.**— Then I don't wish to eat it. A mother longs indeed for a daughter, not a son. In her gossip, it is she (i. e. daughter,) that sympathises with her in petty misunderstandings with the husband or his people ; it is

**Suruchi**.— (tasting a little), Friend, being old. it appears somewhat sour ; mix sugar.  
**Manthara**.— The fruit of divine gift should not be eaten with disgust.  
**Suruchi**.— I am not very particular about lineage. Now that I have no issue at present, how am I any the worse for it.  
**Manthara**.— Here it is, mixed with sugar. Let it be eaten.

**Suruchi**.— Simpleton. Is the perpetuation of lineage the only object of marriage ? There is a flood of inexpressible sensations in youth when the features suddenly assume a glow ; the hair standing on end, delirious joy, thoughts of love, and an ever throbbing heart, besides a special skill of the shrewd eyes in a new language of signs : cupid is the creator of a new world for those who are subject to emotion.

In the forest.  
Enter Sumati and servant with a plate of flowers and fruits.

**Sumati**.— (To himself)

Sister Suneeti was born as a boon of God, in a mansion resembling the palace of Indra. She grew up fondled by the nurses' arms in precious cradles made of gold. But now, in the middle of a forest and in a worn-out shed of thatch, the poor woman suffers neglected by her husband as a great

recluse.

In aflower garden where abounded jasmine creepers of full blown buds, that tender girl, lovely to behold and clad in white was merry, in the white moon. But now, in a region of thorns, filled with bamboos, the young woman suffers, clad in bark, with faded lustre and limping gait. In an excellent pond of crystal water, and in the midst of lotus blossoms, she was a beautiful fish leaping and sporting away as a creeper of lightning, swimming up and about. But now she lies shrivelled up dry and parched up by thirst : she, the virtuous and

beautiful remains plunged in grief owing to her husband's separation.

He bound with chains the Kinnara nymph, that was soaring at large in the heavens, a lovely parrot devoted to music, and confined the pitiable creature trembling all over the body in a cage.

Now, the she-parrot cries out in despair and agony with her beak thrust under the wings; the poor creature implores the giver of all boons, the best beloved of all that is dear, for emancipation.

(Pacing forward and looking about,) servant, how is her majesty engaged ? Is it a suitable hour for visit ?

**Chamberlain**.—That charming lady devotedly attached to Lakshmi's Lord, spends the day in divine worship and service. Her eyes closed and thoughts centred on her husband's feet, she is looking forward to the path of emancipation. Considering that a heinous sin of her own rooted in some relentless Karma of old brought about a husband's separation, she blesses her co-wife that she may obtain in abundance every kind of fortune derivable from meritorious acts.

The lotus eyed lady of slender limbs, is devoid of blood in both the cheeks, and resembles a creeper stricken by a thunderbolt. Constancy of devotion to her husband is her only ornament ; she the fairest and sweet has her lustre concealed by a garment of

**Sumati**.— I have no mind to mislead you by untruth O, auspicious and righteous woman ! The  
monarch sleeps in dense darkness and never dreams of you.  
**Suneeti**.—To me a cottage would be a mansion, the beasts of the jungle would serve as crowding relations, the gruel of the grains even without salt would be a highly relished dish and the tree-bark would serve as a clothing of great value—a dress of silk, if only there was the husband's kind remembrance of me from a sense of my poor condition.  
**Sumati**.— Everything is governed by Hari's will. Let the time of redemption (grace) be awaited. Sister, I have brought some presents for your use; accept (them) with pleasure.

Here is the plantain fruit brought from the hills of which you are greatly fond : here is a cake cooked sweet by (our) mother as your favourite dish.  
**Suneeti**.― The Kunda flowers are beautiful when they are abundantly shared with a beloved husband in the Zest of love ; The braided hair is of enchanting beauty if there be a Lord to pull it (in sport). The plantain turns out the bitterest margosa, when the object of love is far away.  
The mother-in-law is gratified only when a tasteful dish is served to her son-in-law, is it not ?

**Suneeti**.— Why will not my royal husband come here in person to eat it ?

I am condemned unheard like a deer shot unseen by the hunter's arrows. I know not of any fault committed by me in my husband's house that led to his getting offended. Vain becomes this birth (of mine) if I be marched to old age a barren woman at

**Ganga**.— She is very weak : besides, this is her first delivery. I am greatly concerned about it  
as to how a safe delivery will happen (how the tro lires will part).  
**Manthara**.— The son that will be born will be of extraordinary lustre, being the result of a divine-gifted fruit.

black and the slender feminine hip looks big. Food is not retained in the stomach and she vomits often ; with the peculiar taste of pregnancy, she eats clods of earth with avidity. Where is the doubt in the matter ?  
**Suruchi**.— Mother, I no longer wish to live nor to enjoy sovereignty after now hearing of the senior wife's equal fortune as described : instead of beholding the prosperity of an enemy I am willing to suffer barrenness myself ; never can I bear equality with one who occupies the same position as myself, nor endure happiness in the lot of Suneeti.

(Hearing a deep sob.)

**Ganga**.— There are two questions to be asked in this matter.  
First, if it be true that the king never went

to her dwelling, then in the middle of a forest, and separated from her lord, how happened this?

Second. It is an assertion of the astrologers that without a boon, a son is not to be born to his majesty. If then the fruit brought was only one, what becomes of the prediction (of astrologers).

**Suruchi**.— (Looking at Manthara.) Let the two questions be answered.  
**Manthara**.— It is known to me that the king never went there up to now.  
**Suruchi**— How is it known?  
**Manthara**.— Recently I overheard a confidential talk between Suneeti and Sumati in her cottage, myself being concealed. Extremely affected, she besought Sumati that by hook,

or crook, by fair means or deception, her husband should be brought to her without delay. She said in fact:—

"My Lord has not come, and my condition is one unfit to be disclosed; people will speak of me as loose in conduct owing to loss of virtue. Intelligent Sumati, I shall feel grateful to you for a hundred births if you bring him to me for silencing the tongue of scandal.

**Ganga**.—This is news pregnant with meaning, and is enough to accomplish Suneeti's ruin. Daughter, strenuous effort should be made so that the king may not hereafter even think of that direction.

**Suruchi**.— Then, I shall inform the king at once. Who is there? (Enter servant.) Sirrah, go to the king's court and find out if it be opportune to visit the king.

**Servant**.— They say that he left only yesterday for the forest to hunt and that he has not returned yet.  
(The mother, daughter and Manthara stare at one another.)

times she even utters harsh language and praises you and your boy in the presence of the king.  
**Suneeti**.— I am obliged to her.  
**Manthara**.— But without any reason, your memory is unpleasant to the king.  
**Suneeti**.— This is a decree of fate. Is the sister's boy growing up well?  
**Manthara**.— Suruchi is unfortunate in that respect you are to be pitied for a husband's absence and she, on account of a son who is but a living corpse.

In the world, God gives to man a fine intellect only in exchange for the calamity of congenital blindness. To you, he has given a son with talents like those of the immortals

and to her, He has given a son whose body is a bag of boneless flesh.  
**Suneeti**.— I am pained to hear this. I thought that Suruchi was fortunate in every respect.  
**Manthara**.— Rare indeed is such partiality on the part of the Creator.  
**Suneeti**. —Even so, I do not perceive an equality between us.  
**Manthara**.— This indeed is the way of the world everywhere. To all men, what is not possessed by them or what is impossible to obtain is just what seems covetable. Suruchi deems the absence of a husband preferable to the misfortune of a worthless son. Possessed of a fine jewel of a son, you consider (however) the love of a husband preferable.

Queen, I wish to see Dhruva; where is the boy?  
**Suneeti**.— (Looking at the servant). Let the boy be brought.

Enter Dhruva and the nurse.

**Nurse**.— Blessed are you, O madam! see your excellent son of admirable intelligence. He wants 'uncle moon'to be brought to him as a toy to play with. Casting away the toys in anger, he longs to soar up into the sky. He says that his place is in the heavens and that he will play with the stars.

(Suneeti fondles the boy).

**Suneeti**.— Friend, why is his body covered with dust

**Nurse**.— Madam, I took the boy when he was crying to the bank of the lotus pond; there the white swan was sporting in clear water without any concern. It danced on the lotus, with musical peals of sound and kissed the lotus leaf. Listening with attention, he heard the swan's voice echoed in the caves of the forest and asked to my surprise who was making the sound of reply. Unable to answer, I said that there resided in the cave a strange boy Krishna by name. He then starts at once to go and play with him. He sets out pacing slowly into the forest with fearlessaudacity; when pursued, he runs laughing and trips when turning round to look behind

**Manthara**.— Queen, does the boy speak?  
**Suneeti**.— Darling, speak out; where had you been?  
**Boy**.— To play with the boy dwelling in the cave.  
**Suneeti**.— (to herself.)

Young Krishna, an ocean of grace divine, O Hari, protect my son constantly; do protect with tenderness, my son Dhruva a child that has no protector, forsaken by his own father one — that though born with

Fruits viz. wood apples, ebony rose apples, Amalakas![](../books_images/U-IMG-1721189312Screenshot2024-07-17093805.png)(Emblic myrobalan) Pomegranate, Mangoes and plantains; similarly, this painted peacock for the boy; this image of Vencatasa.

Mamma, why are your eyes suffused with tears?

Alas! your father's countenance is a refreshing disc of the moon. That pair of excellent eyes shining like lotus is lovely. His soft and smiling utterance, is a soothing attar of roses. His intellect, dignity and qualities produce an ecstasy of feeling, the hair standing on end.

**Boy.—**I wish to go for seeing him.  
**Suneeti.—**Let it be in proper time.

**Suneeti.**— Madam, what is the cause of suspicion?

**Nurse.**— Even the ants don't rush at the sweet sugar, though they go about close by. They are in-

**Servant.**— A disaster has happened; where is the boy! Is he safe? Alas that woman! how shall I relate it?

**Suneeti.**—What, sirrah, is this wild utterance?

**Servant.**— Manthara being a stranger-woman, (unseen before) the watch-dogs of the sheep-pen seeing her on the road, barked at her; she fled with speed afraid of being bitten; and they did bite off a piece of flesh with sharp-edged teeth.

If a visitor of my house, be bitten by dogs, the censure falls only on me. I don't know if my innocent and faithful toilette-servant is alive or not. It is you that have by carelessness killed my friend.

**Servant.**— There is still something to hear. Let your majesty listen.

**Suneeti.**—Say it quickly.

**Servant.**— Then it happened, that the woman dropped this cake on the floor. By devouring it, all the dogs quickly met with death.

**Nurse.**— Queen, my suspicion has been confirmed. This verily is the same as the one given to the boy.

**Suneeti.**— A serious danger has been averted from my darling child, by the grace of Lord Krishna who is a kinsman of all afflicted people and a sea of kindliness. I did not know that Manthara was a tigress with the face of a cow. Servant, let all the flowers, fruits and toys be thrown away quickly, every one of them.

**Boy.**— Mamma, why are these removed from here?

**Suneeti.**―They are saturated with poison, and unfit to be eaten and unfit also to be offered to the boy Krishna.

**Suruchi.**— Being dog-bitten, she became bedridden for two years.

**King.**— It is perceived beyond doubt that Suneeti is wicked: a woman that causes her innocent and helpless toilette-servant, to be bitten by dogs, taking undue advantage of an opportunity, must be a very hard-hearted person indeed. How is it that it was not heard of by me for two years.

**Suruchi.**— I did not mention this to my royal husband out of regard for the position of the senior queen, and being afraid of tale-telling.

**King.**— This causes uneasiness; why did she go there?

**Suruchi.**—I do not know, she should herself be questioned,

O prince, the body is not you but Dhruva is within. Jeeva (soul) is indeed an eternal self chained in this diminutive body of yours. Truly Narayana is the Lord shining as the original form of which everything else is a reflection.He alone is self-existent, the ruler of all the universe.

This is not an only body. There are several sheaths encasing you.From this bondage of sheaths, your emancipation will occur by the grace of Hari.

If you be one inherently fit to attain Heaven,

**Dhruva.—**(To himself)

I was born in this world O! Narahari, by the force of the king's penance in order to work out my Karma. In the womb of Suneeti replete with worms & faces, I suffered every kind of pain.

O Madhava, I had no wish to form the acquaintance of a father and mother; bound with ropes by time and the sins of Karma I have been led hither.

A nurse and a mother strangled me by an abundance of ill-timed sleep and food. I suffered immeasurable pain, by swallowing doses of oil, with abundant weepings. (cries).

So incalculable have been the births I have undergone.

The drops of tears I have shed, will if collected together, make up a sea. O, Madhava in the course of births beyond all calculation I have undergone sufferings of every kind of description. (At last) deeming the monarch's lap as heaven, I was distracted by the failure to attain it. O, Madhava let no desire be directed towards transient fruits that only rivet bondage.

**ACT IV. SCENE I.**

In palace. (Enter Sumati and the king).

**King—**O Sumati, is there on Earth, or elsewhere, a man so unfortunate as myself?

The senior wife is a lover of quarrels, and is enjoying herself without any concern, her thoughts bent on pleasure. The other is so mean as to be ever prepared with girded loins to wage war with a child. This son of mine born of Suruchi is virtually a corpse, and deserves not the name 'Uttama': above all, (my son)**the genius has gone to the jungle. Who is there so miserable in misfortune as myself?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Sumati.—**I am liable to be suspected of partiality as the brother of Suneeti. However to speak the truth is my duty.

Ever devoted to Hari and trustful in the lead of a husband's footstep, Suneeti is pining away emaciated by the fire of a lover's longing. The word of tale-bearers should not be listened to with trust. The propensity for mischief attributed to her is as false as the horn of a hare.

**King.—**What say you, Sumati, in the matter of Man- thara? Is she a good-natured woman who thus instigates the biting by dogs. No, my wives are neither of them deserving of praise. An exile into the forest or suicide is the only course to be thought of by me.

**Sumati.—**This Manthara is wicked by nature and resembles the Manthara of Kaikeyi. My lord, her story is false. This is what people say.

**King.—**There is not the slightest proof that it is false. Let it alone: their topic is unpleasant to me. My head reels: the floor too whirls likewise. Friend I am almost mad. There is indeed no consolation for me.

**Sumati.—**Your excellent boy will surely return, with the aid of Narayana's grace. Verily intelligence of that order must have originated only from the supreme grace of Vishnu.

**King.—**He who surpasses cupid forcibly steals my thoughts. No magnet possesses the attractive force of this boy. Without doubt Dhruva may be a product of divine grace. How can he be of such brightness otherwise.

**Sumati.—**Is this only a probability ? How is it forgotten by your majesty ? He is truly (a boy) born of the mango fruit obtained by the grace of Narayana.

**King.—**Not so; only a single fruit was brought and wholly eaten away by Suruchi. How then can Dhruva be the result of a boon?

**Sumati.—**My lord, he is really the result of a boon. I wonder how it is still unknown to your majesty. I pray your majesty will listen.

The proud queen Suruchi swallowed only the juice, casting away the seed. I gave that to Suneeti and hence Dhruva is a genius.

Gone is he my excellent boy into the dense jungle. What is the right course to be adopted by me? I will not live, no indeed, no indeed.

**King.** — OSumati, bring hither the soul stirring son, whose face is fresh as lotus, whose voice rings majestic as the swan's, whose eyes are broad and charming and who casts a spell on all that have common eyes to see.

In the whole world, where is the boy Ofriend, shining with an equal figure or where in the whole world is there a wretched king equal to me in being plunged in stupidity?

**Sumati.**— Every human endeavour shall be made to find Dhruva.

**King**.— What is the crime you committed.

**Suruchi.**— I am a sinner.  
Like a frog at the fire of a great cobra's eyes, have I been hypnotised by the look of Dhruva. My mind has been altogether paralysed by the brilliancy; I am lost, my mind converted into a fly that hovers round a lamp-light (and ultimately dies in the flame). No doubt I obstruted the boy and spoke to him like one possessed. When the boy's feet disappeared from view my limbs shook and I was seized with dread. I spent a

Manthara, being on the point of death, confesses her crimes through fear. Although Lord Vishnu may be a mine of forgiveness, he will surely send me to the pitch-dark hell. As I lived by tale-telling, my falsehoods have been beyond calculation. I hated the lady Suneeti as I, by nature, hated all good people.

O Bhima, Kunti's son, an avatar of strength, O Lord, the destroyer of Duryodhana, be pleased to destroy with the maceblows struck by your victorious arms, the host of foes consisting of lust, anger, conceit and the rest that are preying on the vitals of the heart and render strong my faith in Krishna.

I prostrate before you, august Madhwa, an avatar of spiritual lore, devoted to the service of Satyavati's son, and basking in the sunshine of knowledge emanating from the great preceptor on the Himalayan peak. The enduring faith in Hari, conferred on me by your incarnation as Hanuman and rendered

This poor individual, torn by the arrows of an enemy, approaches with awe, in quest of a ship, the great bliss-bodied Fish, that shone as a sun, destroyed the Asura, and was adored by the Solar king (Satyavrata). May the Fishgod swimming in the world-destroying waters of the deluge, protect me, a cripple whose thoughts are imprisoned in the meshes of the wicked fisherman Kali, in the flooding waves of birth.

Thy illusory tortoise-form was pleased to upheave Mandara, the mountain of Gold, when, being churned hard with an excess of sweating fatigue by the combined hosts of righteous Devas and jealous Daityas, and tossed by waves and winds, it was about to founder, like the mind of the wicked overpowered by the organs of sense. To that Tortoise bestowing bliss on the Devas, be this prostration of mine.

I bow here before this adored and universally adorable Boar-form God who feigned a slow and doubtful fight at first, and, being appealed to by the entreaty of Suras, killed the wicked and low son of Diti who was the arch-enemy of the most righteous of mankind and was elated by the pride of an immense prowess such as terrorised the vast hosts of Devas' leaders.

Playful mind, address yourself to Him who is the destroyer of death itself, the adored deity of the Daitya boy, who assumed the form of an excellent lion-faced man to kill the garrulous Hiranya Kasipu, who rescued the hero of boys from dangerous situations in which he was sought to be killed by elephants, by fire, by the swallowing of a virulent poison, by drowning, and by a fall from the summit of a mountain, and who cured him of the fever of all accumulated sins.

To thee, the boy of liliputian guise, who saved Indra and humiliated Bali (the Daitya), and who destroyeth sins (of worshippers) as fire consumes a forest of down, be this prostration.

To thee, the Bramhan avatar (1) that was an ornament of the Bhrigu race, (2) that destroyed an unrighteous clan of kings (3),

that was a ferocious cobra or spear in the heart of the wicked, and (4) that guarded the world with an axe, be this humble prostration.

Adore here that Hari (1) who is the father of Bramha (Sarasvati's Lord), (2) who saved the Devas by boons, from the sufferings caused by Rakshasas the enemies of all sages, (3) who guarded the sacrifice of Visvamitra and of the Rishis with his fleet arrows, who snapped the bow of Siva the offspring of Bramha, a deity adored by Asuras of intense unbridled passions (4) who was the hero of the prayers (a) of the lady consigned to the forest by Mathanga's curse and (b) of Sarabhanga the prince of ascetics and (c) of garuda (the God of birds).

I prostrate here before Damodara of a dark cloudy hue, the refuge of the suffering humanity, who, adorned in jewelry of gold, and clad in saphired robes, appeared and carried away the clothes of damsels,— who

O Buddha, who created delusion in the descendants of Diti by a system of Buddhistic philosophy that looked reasonable and consoling, do thou step in, and purify my mind by depriving it of impious Buddhistic theories. Vexed by the succession of births and deaths, I seek shelter of thee O Hari, known as Kalki, incarnated for the destruction of the wicked, riding on an excellent steed; forgive my sins, O Lord, and make me holy.

May He protect me, -- who saved the great elephant, huge as a hill, from the effects of

O Vyasa, liberal fountain of boons, make me ardent in the pursuit of a wealth which consists in relishing the honeyed essence of Vedanta as elucidated by the shastras of Vayu.

Make me eminent with the lore esteemed by the sage Jaya the follower of the footsteps of Sri Madhwa the master of the Vedas. By means of the shastras codifying the vedic teachings and of holy water flowing from Hari's feet, ordain me pure, standing as I do in supplication, with hands folded over the head.

On my head, place for ever the faultless 'lotus of foot' that sanctifies its worshippers more than anything else deemed holy.

O Thou Lakshmi's lord, source of the holiest stream, sovereign of all whose footstep is hallowed, May the lotus of foot now purify my mind. May this lotus of foot of inconceivable lustre, that metamorphosed a rock into a woman— which was pleased to roam about Brindavana, and which blessed cows and maids in the woods, be the fountain- head of a river consisting of my emancipation (salvation).

The same soft (lotus) flower of Vishnu which sat lightly on the shoulders of devoted Hanuman like a piece of cotton— the same

of Murari, which was impregnable as a thunder-bolt when it destroyed Sakata– and which rested like a nectar-pot on the palms of Garuda's hand.

Let Thy foot which blessed Bali who bore it on his head, rest and dance upon my head. May that foot-lotus which subdued the unbounded arrogance of Kalinga, dislodge the spirit of Kali rankling in my heart.

I bow before that tender foot which glanced bright on the kunkuma in the bosoms of Vraja's lovely maids when Thou wert an infant form, and which measured the three worlds in three paces in the subjugation of a Danava.

May that all-protecting lotus of foot, be glorious, which expands myriads of petals at the prayer-ful music of devotees, which is always full-blown (never being a bud ) because of a perpetual vedic sun-shine — which wafts a fragrance consisting of final felicity, — which is filled with the honey of Grace, and which is adored by Padma (the lotus deity) herself. May that tender and beautiful pair of feet, a spirit dense of bliss — that priceless and

My lord, be Thou pleased out of affection to bathe this heated head of mine, consumed by the fires of Junma, with ambrosial showers of Thy pre-eminent grace, flowing from Thy 'Foot lotus' fragrant with cool and agreeable perfume.

O joy, rare indeed is the sight of juvenile ascetics like these, shining like incandescent coals and abounding in spiritual force.  
(apart) Forester, stopping here, we will hear this talk. (They sit down among the trees)

**Krishnadasa—**Well, Soumya, hasten the collection of flowers. My basket is nearly full of Tulasi leaves.

**Soumya—**It is easier to gather Tulasi leaves than flowers, because Tulasi leaves remain crowding thick on the branches of the plant. Hence your basket is full and not ours of Kunda blossoms.

** सौम्यः —** सहैवास्माभिर्गन्तव्यमिति ते प्रतिज्ञा॥

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Meenanka—**I don't think that is the reason. Our friend has a special skill in gleaning Tulasi leaves.

**Soumya—**What is this special skill?

**Meenanka—**Observe how he plucks them. It looks as if Tulasi, with a motherly love for devotees, rushes forward with effort into the regions of our friend's fingers, rather than that he exerts himself to gather the leaves.

**Soumya.—** What is the cause of Tulasi's enthusiasm?

**Meenanka.**— Affection for devotees.

**Krishnadasa**.— Friends, I go in advance to the cottage with your leave.

**Soumya**.— Your promise was to accompany us.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Sumati**.— (apart) Well forester, who is the boy gathering Tulasi? There is something remarkable about his features, eyes, gait and speech.

**Forester.—** I do not know. As I saw from a great distance, I remember faintly that it was he that remained under the smoke of penance.

**Meenanka**. — (to Krishnadasa) Why such hurry though your austerities have been finished ?

**Forester**.— (apart) Sir, please listen.

**Krishnadasa**.— If finished, why am I walking on the Earth?

**Soumya**.— A reference to penance reminds me —how strong-minded our friend was who went through the severest austerities for a long time without food and drink!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Forester.**— (apart) Sir, this undoubtedly appears the sage.

**Sumati.**— Indeed, this creates hope.

**Meenanka.**— Even now he does not eat.

**Soumya.**— We will ask our friend himself. Friend, it is said that you eat nothing at all in the day or night. How came about this total absence of appetite (for eating) ?

**Krishnadasa.**— For a long time, the desire to eat and drink was unconquerable. It gave me constant and severe pain to control. Its pride and power abated after the vision of Vishnu, and the appetite vanished at the taste of the honeyed juice in the feet of Hari. (at the enjoyment of pleasures afforded by a contemplation of Hari).

**Meenanka**— We are still engaged in studying words and sentences in PramanaLakshana by repeated recitations, being dazzled by mere verbiage. We do not realize god even in imagination. But he has seen Lakshmi's Lord in person and adored His Lotus feet.

**Soumya**— In other births have the Shastras been studied by him.

**Meenanka**— (Continuing to gather flowers) Soumya, observe this royal sage how he often sheds drops of tears. He is afflicted a little by grief. What may be the cause ?

**Sumati**.— (To himself) The word 'Royal sage' is a second ground of hope.  
**Soumya**.— It is rumoured that his father is suffer-

**Krishnadasa**.— It is not now that my father is deranged in mind. His madness was quite evident when he married two wives.  
**Sumati**.— (To himself) From this it is established that this is the boy. I will listen to the cause of grief. He may be anxious to return home.  
**Soumya**.— (To Krishnadas) Then what is the cause of your uneasiness ?  
**Krishnadasa**.— Before I was born, my father saw Vishnu the giver of Heaven (Moksha) ; and he contented himself with praying for a son, just as I under similar circumstances got the position of Dhruva. My family appears suffering under a curse, by reason of which, neither by me nor by my father Uttana pada, was Heaven (Moksha) secured, not. withstanding a personal vision of Lakshmi's

Lord. This grief incessantly troubles me. We have gathered enough of flowers. Let us go.

**Sumati**.— (appears in a hurry) A moment here, will you stop, O, beautiful boy; my head whirls with the intoxication of excessive  
joy; wiping aside my tears when the hands get steady, O Dhruva, I shall hug you, my sister's son, to my bosom.(The boys look with surprise)

**Krishnadasa**.— (apart) Soumya, I understand that this is Sumati my maternal uncle. Hold the

**Sumati**.— Be you long-lived. (so embraces).

**Soumya—** Krishnadasa, we will go in advance and get ready the hospitalities due to a guest. Bring up the gentleman.

(Exeunt Soumya and Meenanka).

**Dhruva**.— Uncle, is everybody doing well in the city and the country?

**Sumati**— All are happy, except your parents.

**Dhruva**.— They are alive, I hope.

**Sumati**.— They live, but are plunged in an ocean of grief.

**Dhruva**.— The bondage of desire rules the mind, and leads it to destruction, by binding it to the objects of sense. Sorrow and joy are alike dispensed by Lakshmi's Lord. It is He that sends us everything.

**Sumati—**If you go with me, universal bliss will follow.

**Dhruva—** They say that my father is stricken with madness. What is the cause of it?

**Sumati**— Your separation is the cause.

**Dhruva**— My separation !! It is wonderful !! Does my father remember me?

**Sumati**— Not only does he remember, but thinks of

you incessantly, and keeps repeating your name. This fever of separation cannot endure any delay.

**Dhruva** — Let my father think that he never saw me.

**Sumati**.— Is this the reply also to the mother's grief ?

**Dhruva**.— If my father has relented, it follows that mamma is living with him, the king's favour resecured.

**Sumati**.— Yes.

**Dhruva**.—That virtuous lady knowing the philosophy of the scriptures, and devoting herself to the service of Him who rules the husband's heart, will be happy with the consolation that chastity itself is a son.

**Sumati.—**You do not realize what a mother's affection means.

The king who is bedridden, is always agitated on your account. She wants you not only because of her own affection but also for the welfare of her husband.

**Dhruva.—**Engaged in the service of her husband, in due course of time, she will forgetme.

**Sumati.—**That is absolutely impossible. If you donot start without delay, then she is sure to come here soon. In fact, she roams in theforest every night.

She sings your lovely life and ponders overyour lotus-face incessantly. The lovely woman is fading away, recalling your

**ACT V. SCENE III.**

*In the bazaar street; Enter 2 Merchants namedBhanumati, Prathoodara.*

**Bhanumati.—**Brother, how is trade in the market?

**Prathoodara.—** No debtor repays a debt withoutdifficulty. If a suit be filed in a court of

justice, one has to guard the doorway ofpleaders for a full year. Then the judgesrefuse to award the compound interest whichis our profit. So I have given up money-lending.

**Bhanumati.—**Trade in grain is equally bad. Theprice of grain has greatly fallen in the market. There is neither seller nor buyer.

**Prathoodara.—** Then what is being done now? Letbrother-in-law take me as a partner withequal share in something or other.

**Bhanumati.—**Recently I began a new trade ingold and rubies. They say that there willbe great profit in it.

**Prathoodara.—** So also, fear of king's punishment.It is only by theft of what is rubbed on thetouchstone, and by receipt of jewels producedby thieves, that profit has to be derived.

**Bhanumati.—**That is a trade-secret derived from tradition. What is the good of mentioning it? If you wish, be my partner in this business.

**Prathoodara.—** This is no trading but only cheating: but as it is enjoined by honoured custom, it must be followed. Be it so; I will contribute my share of capital.

**Bhanumati.—** O, joy ! I think that our contract is very auspicious. See, on the road, goes a certain rustic with a long beard. In his hand see a necklace with dazzling gems set therein. Call him here.

*(Prathoodara does as bidden). (Enters, forester, holding a necklace in hand).*

**Bhanumati.—**Friend, Is the necklace for sale ?

**Forester.—** I shall give it if a suitable price be got.

**Bhanumati.—** I will examine it; hand it up *(So takes it with both hands, and rubs it on the touchstone)*. Brother, the gold appears to be slightly impure. Observe on your touchstone.

**Prathoodara.—** (*doing so*). It seems so in my opinion too.

**Forester.—** At what value is this estimated?

**Bhanumati.—** If only there was not this dark line in the diamond, it would be simply invaluable. Sir, let this be in my box. After showing it to a few merchants, I will return it in the evening. Please call again. *(So saying he puts it in a box)*.

**Forester.—** I will bring it in the evening. Let the necklace be returned.

**Bhanumati.—** When given and into whose hand?

Then enters the town guard policeman.

**Forester.—** I shall go and inform the King.

**Policeman.—** Take this 100 Rs. If you reveal this, imprisonment will be the consequence to you. Such is the law in cities.

**Forester.**—Let something more be paid.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**King.—** I am greatly obliged by the gift of the sage, for, my son is virtually born again.

**Dhruva.—** *(Prostrating before Suruchi)*.

The lesson that you *(mother)* taught me by considering me unfit to set foot on this throne of the King without first worshipping the lotus-feet of Krishna venerated by Pranesa, has been a blessing attended with spiritual merit. I therefore first prostrate at your feet as those of my preceptor, a stepmother's though they:be.

**Suruchi.—** God be thanked that you, a mere child as you are, have returned safe after a journey

in the woods, to save me and confer joy on your mother and father, at last. Accursed me, that I spoke harsh words without sense. As you happened to be a boy of meritorious spirituality, a pious faith resulted, as if from my random words.

**Dhruva—***(Prostrating to father).*

My father, pardon the boy who being easily offended, abandoned you his own father, for a long time, in order to promote his own pleasure. The pang that resulted to you on my account cursed Dhruva *(me)* in such a way that moksha was not obtained *(by him)* in spite of the direct interview he had with Lakshmi's Lord.

**King—** Darling! having wished to ascend the region of my lap, just for a moment, and failed in

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the attempt, you have soared to the exalted height of Dhruva's planet, there to reign till the very end of a cycle of time *(Kalpa)*. Ojoy! blessed indeed am I, my good son, that I have beheld here your lovely face, with eyes suffused with tears of joy. That I, a father, have been excelled by my own son, is just as it should be.

**Dhruva.—** *(Prostrating before his mother Suneeti).* Mother, for a long time to come, I will not part from the nursing shelter of your hands. In the jungle, it was your ambrosial blessing that always shielded me *(from danger).*

Mother, living with me and the King, quite easy in mind, there will be no occasion at all hereafter for you to wash your hands with tears.

*(Suneeti embracing her darling over and over again*

*said nothing).*

*(To herself).*

At first a residence in the forest, away from the husband and neglected by him,— then, the birth of this boy preceded by an eating of the seed, (then) his journey to the forest and return,— recollecting all this, and now, being face to face with Dhruva my son of beautiful form, I feel engulfed in an ocean of ecstasy,— my bosom filled with mother's milk pouring it out, because of maternal tenderness.

**Narada.**—Dhruva, come *(here).*

I will at once seat you on the lap of the King, as on that account, you grieved in the forest, suffering from humiliation.
