PREFACE

  After a long intervalappears this second and altered version of my edition of *Śakuntalā*. It is unusual for a text-book with a fairly large demand to fail in supply for a long period. That is why this publication seems to call for a satisfactory explanation. I may, therefore, be permitted to state briefly the circumstances which have caused this inordinate delay in bringing out this edition.

  The first edition was exhausted on the eve of World War II. As I was casting about for preparation and publication of a second edition, in answer to demands from different educational centres of the country, there came the war and with it overwhelming changes. The small sub-divisional town of Feni in East Bengal, where I was in employment, changed overnight into one of the biggest airforce centres of the Allies in India with a number of aerodromes all around it. The College buildings, hostels, and even our residential quarters were all commandeered for the purpose at a very short notice, and the college with its staff and students and its complete paraphernalia had to shift to a distant district. We had to go through bustling preparations for departure from Feni and settling down in Brahmanbaria in Comilla. It was impossible in these circumstances to secure the requisite quota of paper and arrange for the necessary 'imprimatur' for the publication of a book of this nature. Towards the conclusion of the war came the great Bengal Famine, and it was as much as we could think of and do to secure rice at Rs. 100/- per maund to keep ourselves alive. That was not the time for the like of us to go in for publishing a bulky volume. Following on the heels of the crushing famine came the grim horror of Noakhali riots, raging rampant leading to a deadly massacre, butchering thousands and beggering millions, when mothers, maidens, widows and infants cowered in an agony of terror. Thus faced with odds beyond arithmetic and unable to bear



further the sickening suspense threatening the very existence, we had to leave behind our plundered homes and escape to Calcutta with our bare lives. In Calcutta I found myself in an alien sphere, and could not have dreamt of undertaking the work of this new edition but for a lucky chance which introduced me to that far-famed classical scholar, Professor Prabhat Kumar Mukherjee, M. A., P. R. S., of Calcutta University and Vidyasagar College. He spoke highly of my edition of Śakuntalā and pressed me for a second edition. I pleaded my lack of necessary funds, whereupon the kindly professor undertook to negotiate with Sri Dinesh Chandra Bose and Sri Rabindranarayan Bhattacharyya of the Modern Book Agency. Sri Bhattacharyya agreed to take up the work of publication on condition I diminished the size of the book by curtailment of matter that might shorten it by 200 pages. This condition had to be accepted. Even so, I deem myself profoundly grateful to Sri Bhattacharyya for this help in bringing the book once again to light.

 This, then, is the background of the new edition. Regarding the book itself as presented in this edition, the first thing to say is that the book has been considerably condensed, as has already been stated. This, however, has not altered the essential character of the book. For, only certain devices and curtailment of inessential matter have helped to control its girth. For instance, many authors and their works have been referred to in abbreviation. Commentary and particularly the grammatical portion in the Notes have been much scissored through. The 'change of voice' has been altogether omitted and in all stage directions and Sanskrit renderings of the Prākṛta speeches, *Bourgeois* has been used in lieu of *Antic*.

 On the other hand, I have sought to introduce some improvements : Certain readings in the previous edition have been modified in the light of other readings that have been deemed better. The *Prākṛta* of the text, which often lives in a realm of sad and doleful neglect, has been more carefully



attended to. I record here my grateful acknowledgment of the immensely valuable suggestions and advice I have received from Professor Prabhat Kumar Mukherjee, whose renown as an authority in Prākṛta drew me to him and whose scholarship, evinced in all the discourses I had with him, made me lean on him as infallible guide, as the honoured Nestor of Prakritists. Abundant references have been supplied in this edition for the benefit of inquisitive and advanced students. To help in the realisation of beauty of kindred thoughts and expressions of the "mighty minds of old", parallel passages and similar ideas from celebrated authors, especially from Shakespeare, have been brought in as far as possible within the brief compass at my disposal. In this matter too, I am mainly indebted to Professor Mukherjee, no less renowned as a real scholar, nay a prodigy in Shakespearean lore, whose versatility calls to mind the sweet reminiscences of the young 'Mirandula' and the 'Admirable Crichton', and his help to me so ungrudgingly given whenever solicited, can hardly be expressed in words. Here I can ill afford to pass off in silence the kind condescension of his, in lending me the use of his private library with occasional loans of rare and valuable books and in furnishing me with various references I urgently needed for an earlier expedition of the work—references so readily profferred, I believe, as is possible for one of encyclopædic knowledge and capacious memory of singular nature, unique of its kind.

 Rabindranath's rendering in Bengali verse and the Sanskrit rendering by Tārā Śaṅkara Kaviratna of Goethe's world-famed lines on Śakuntalā have been prefixed to this work.

 In conclusion, I must acknowledge also the help and advice of Principal N. L. Ganguli of Dum Dum Motijhil College, a great friend and a former colleague of mine and Professor Srish Chandra Das, late of the Dacca University, and a present



colleague. Lastly, Sri Rabindranarayan Bhattacharyya has to be mentioned in connection with the speedy publication of the book. The question of publication being settled rather at the eleventh hour, Sri Bhattacharyya has had to take the help of more than one press to push through the printing vigorously, which may have therefore left some blemishes unattended to.

 As the cost of publication has gone up considerably of late, the price of a copy has to be fixed slightly higher than that of the first edition.

 I think, I have spared no pains in making this work really useful to students of Kālidāsa, and, if it gives satisfaction to them, my pains would be amply rewarded.

**PREFACE**  

**TO THE FIRST EDITION**

 In bringing out an edition of a work like *S'akuntalā* at this time of the day, when not the spade-work of research but more or less complete editions from erudite sources are available, an apology must necessarily be grounded on the sincere purpose of the compiler to pass the work into greater circulation by throwing into an easily digestible form the results of all previous labours. To a serious student of this great classic, notwithstanding all that has been accomplished hitherto in this direction, there still seems to be present a real difficulty in bringing together the mass of materials that the scholars have severally gathered, for it cannot be contended that the stage of original work here is now passed. I had myself felt the difficulty in my University days, and have since felt the need of another compilation of the kind attempted here in course of lecturing to the B. A. classes of my College. In the present edition, which has its genesis in my class-notes of some years back, I have endeavoured to obviate this difficulty, although for the reason mentioned above I have had to incorporate my bit of independent work, small as that is.

 The text of *S'akuntalā* has come down to us in as many different versions as the scriptions the original text was copied in. The German scholars have conveniently classified them in accordance with the characters of these manuscripts as Bengali, Devanagri, Kashmiri and South India recensions. They widely differ from one another, and of these none seems older than the sixteenth century. As regards the original itself, it is supposed to be now irretrievably lost.

 In spite of the difference that exists among these various recensions, the many points of resemblance between the Bengali version on the one hand and the Kashmiri and the South India



recensions on the other have been noticed, thus inviting a natural discrimination between these and the Devanagri recension which very considerably and materially differs from the other group and particularly from the Bengali reading. Scholars, too, are far from being unanimous on the relative merits of the various recensions. The first introduction of *S'akuntalā* into the distinguished circles of Europe—notably those of Goethe, Herder and other early nineteenth century celebrities of Germany—by Sir William Jones was in Latin and English renderings of the [Bengali version](#). Thence it lent itself to other translations in various European languages with the result that it may be said to have been established in reputation, and Sir John Lubbocks (Lord Averbury afterwards) has given it a place among his "Hundred best books of the world."

 Here in this country Paṇḍita Iśvara Candra Vidyāsāgara and Dr Monier-Williams are responsible for the first modern editions of *S'akuntalā* with different readings. Vidyāsāgara drew from eight manuscripts and Williams from a far larger collection.

 Next year Dr. R. Pischel (Kiel, 1877) brought out a very carefully compiled edition basing himself on the Bengali recension. While Pischel would have nothing to do with the South India version, Williams "consulted other Bengali Mss., but rarely admitted readings from them unless supported by some one of the Devanagri". Elsewhere he observes, "The copyists in Bengal have been Paṇḍits whose 'cacoëthes' for amplifying and interpolating has led to much repetition and amplification". Now, it is obvious that the predilection attributed by Williams to the Paṇḍits of Bengal may easily be discovered in those of other places. It would seem again that it has not occurred to the learned editor that the fact of king Bhoja, Mammaṭa Bhaṭṭa and other non-Bengali authorities in the past having



freely drawn upon the Bengali version for illustrations in their authoritative works does not appear to lend countenance to his theory of this special 'cacoëthes'. Natural presumption here would undoubtedly be that there must have been older versions of the play which had fed the works of these authors as well as the Bengali versions. This would again appear to suggest that the interpolations, if there had been any, had occurred earlier than the times of the Bengali recension. Prof. Ryder of California University on the other hand confesses to an emphatic preference for the Bengali version, and thinks the Devanagri to be a mere abridged edition, as, say, *Laghu-kaumudī* is an abridged editionof *Siddhānta- Kaumudī*, *Bṛhat-kathā-mañjarī* of *Bṛhat-kathā* and *Kādambarī-kathā-sāra* of *Kādambarī*.**![](../books_images/U-IMG-1736594473Capture2.PNG)**

 With a detached perspective and maintaining one's judgment open on such controversial issues it may be asserted without fear of contradiction that none of the extant versions is free from the sort of addition and alteration Dr. Monier-Williams so bitterly complains of. The proper attitude should therefore seem to be one of mere usefulness based on a critical perception of the several degrees of complication in the different recensions. With such an open view Dr. Monier-Williams might have profited from his consultation of the Bengali Mss.,—although one cannot shirk the admission of a greater degree of liberty with the original in them—,and then we might have had from him a more perfect work with better readings. There is no doubt that his ignorance of the

**![](../books_images/U-IMG-1736594473Capture2.PNG)**

"Several versions of the text have been preserved; it is from the "larger" of the two more familiar ones that the translation in this volume has been made. In the warm dissension over the matter certain technical arguments of some weight have been advanced in favour of this choice; there is also a more general consideration which seems to be of importance. I find it hard to believe that any lesser artist could pad such a masterpiece, and pad it all over, without making the fraud apparent on almost every page. The briefer version, on the other hand, might easily grow out of the longer either as an acting text or a school book".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



far-famed brilliant commentary of Rāghabha Bhaṭṭa had worked as a handicap and prevented him from exercising that discretion.

 Of late interesting discussions have been set afoot on the possibility of constructing a definite, standard text of the play.**![](../books_images/U-IMG-1736594534Capture2.PNG)** Meanwhile the readings given by the late-lamented Principal S Ray of Vidyāsagar College, Calcutta, may be allowed to hold the field. The work of Prof. Gajendragadkar as well as that of Mr. Kale in this direction have also been admirable and deserve best recognition. Another name, not the less recognised in this field, is that of Prof. P. N Patankar, whose contribution to the collection and examination of the various readings is admittedly the most comprehensive and thorough. In editing my readings I have fully availed myself of the fruits of their labour, and have, besides, carefully compared the readings of celebrated oriental scholars like my revered teacher Prof. B. B. Gosvāmī, M. M Nyāyapañcānana, Bhuban Basāk, Haridāsa Siddhāntavāgīśa, as well as those of the famous commentators like Rāghava Bhaṭṭa, Śaṅkara, Candra-śekhara, Kāṭayavema and others. I have also derived valuable help in this matter of readings from rhetoricians like Dhanañjaya, author of *Daśarūpaka*, Viśvanātha Kavirāja of *Sāhitya-darpaṇa*, Mammata Bhaṭṭa of *Kāvyaprakāśa*, King Bhoja, author of *Sarasvatīkaṇṭhābharaṇa*, and also from grammarians Nāgeśa Bhaṭṭa, Durgādāsa and others who have drawn upon the play for illustrations in their technical works.

 At this stage I would like to indicate the lines on which I have worked in preferring my readings as they appear here in the text. I do not pretend at any comprehensive principle in my selection, but I feel that I have spared no pains in justifying to myself the readings I have adopted.

 Firstly then, it should be noted that no word or passage in the text has been taken on surmise, but must have occurred in that very order in some recension or other. Secondly, what has been accepted in all the extant versions has been accepted by me as unquestionable. The next general dictum that I have followed is that what appears in most of the versions should be accepted if there is no objection on the lines adumbrated hereafter. Thus, solitary readings are to be preferred if supported by exactly similar adaptations in other works of the poet. Readings consonant with stage directions have to be preferred to others which explicitly violate them. Those readings which are plainly defective or incongruous with the sense of the passages related thereto or pleonastic, or have rivals in improved meaning have to be rejected in favour of solitary readings which are perfect. Particularly in the case of selection of certain words and phrases which are known to be favourite with the poet, especially if any of them happen to be archaic, the readings accepting such may be taken as genuine. The evidence deducible from acceptance by rhetoricians has to be weighed in the light of foregoing principles and are to be rejected or accepted accordingly. And when all is said and done, I feel, as no doubt others working in this field have felt, an unexorcisable phantom of uncertainty hovering over the readings. I feel much improvement might yet be accomplished here and there.

 It now remains to mention briefly the general plan of the present work. In the first place, I have anticipated a natural objection to regional publication of a play of such universal recognition as *S'akuntalā* enjoys. I have, accordingly, avoided not only Bengali character but even Bengali renderings throughout the book. The commentary has been framed on the basis of Rāghava Bhaṭṭa, Vidyāsāgara and Nyāyapañcānana, and has been simplified to the extent where without sacrificing the inevitable profundity of the more important parts of the text it may be made helpful even to



casual readers of the great work. For the benefit of advanced students observations on the technique, prosody and other details have been placed at the end of Commentary. In the matter specially designed for such serious students I have embellished my studies with relevant extracts from Rāghava Bhaṭṭa and other reputed commentators. I gratefully acknowledge in this connection my obligation to Mahāmahopādhyāya Haridāsa Siddhāntavāgīśa, the veteran Paṇḍita and author of many works, who has kindly permitted me to incorporate in this book a portion bearing on rhetoric from his own edition of the play.

 Grammar is the very life of Sanskrit. It has accordingly been treated at some length and claims to form the chief interest of the present work. For ready reference the student will find with each Sūtra the corresponding number for *Aṣṭādhyāyī* and *Kaumudī*. I have also freely made use of *Prabhā*, a recent grammatical publication by Prof. Devendranātha Vidyāratna, M. A., which is a popular, standard work much in request among students. Where a glossary has been necessary the supporting lexicon has been invariably mentioned and quoted from. Difficult grammar, rhetoric and other details of the kind have been clapped between brackets, and may easily be omitted on the first reading. The student will find here an abundant collection of what are commonly known as 'parallel passages'. These are mainly of two kinds. It is well known that repetition of favourite ideas, words and phrases forms one of the specialities of Kālidāsa, and the entire works of Kālidāsa have accordingly been laid under contribution to furnish illustration of such repetition. Besides these, parallel passages from English, Bengali and other Sanskrit works have been freely introduced.

 One of the most formidable tasks for a Sanskrit compiler—one which exercises his utmost ingenuity—is confessedly the English translation of the text. Here I have striven to fulfil



the dictum enunciated by my late uncle **Prof. Kunjalal Nag, M. A.** who commanded a wide reputation as an Anglo-Sanskrit scholar. He held, that "translation should be a faithful reproduction of syntactical structure, even at a little cost of idiom, so that re-translated it may be almost exactly in the words of the original text". Words which are, however, absolutely necessary for the English rendering but do not occur in the text have been given in italics and placed within brackets.

 The topics which it has not been possible to touch in the commentary itself without sacrificing its integral character have been discussed in detail in the *Notes*. There a considerable body of historical, mythological, legal and other references have been placed, and these, it is hoped, will go a great way in clarifying the intention of many an involved passage in the text. In fact, they will be found to form a particular feature of this book. I should here specifically refer to my indebtedness to the work of Sir Monier-Williams for suggestive criticism, although I have had to differ from him in several places. The other suggestions and opinions that I have discussed, accepted or regretfully rejected have been duly credited to their authors in their proper places. And while I have not regarded it necessary to attach a separate bibliographical list to the book, let me express here my sincerest obligation to the authors whom I have laid under contribution in one way or another. Endeavour has been made to lend this work a through-going character; yet I am painfully conscious of the possibility of many short-comings that must still remain.

 My erstwhile colleague Prof. Giridhar Chakravarty, M. A., B. L. deserves my first thanks for encouraging me at the very beginning to undertake the labour of this compilation. Sri B. B. Dutta[^1], M. A., B. L., P. R. S., Ph. D., another of my former colleagues, and Prof. C. Mitra M. A., of my college have seen through the Mss. and

[^1]: "Inspector of Colleges, Cal. University."



my pupil Srimān Anil Chandra Banerji B.A[^2]. has copied out a goodly portion of them for the Press. Prof. Mitra has also given me an indispensable aid in correcting the proof-sheets. I have also been able to secure valuable help from my colleague Prof. Gopal Halder M.A., B L. in writing the Introduction, while a brother of mine, who is an officer in the Forest Department, has furnished me with many botanical names for use in the book. I have also derived help from my colleagues Profs. S. Sen. M. A. and N. Ganguli M, A., and Paṇḍita Kurunāth Nyaya-Vyākaraṇatīrtha of the local Tol in various ways. To all these friends, who have been so kind to me, profuse and unstinted in their help, I owe an acknowledgment of my deepest gratitude.

[^2]: "Now Dr. Anil Chandra Banerjee M. A., Ph. D., Lecturer, Calcutta University."

 Finally, there is an apology to make. Owing to protracted illness it has not been possible for me to get even with the printer's devil, and the result has been that the book is interspersed with typographical errors, which even the *Errata* given at the close may not have been able to cover. I can only hope, the very unwelcome legion will not be there to taint a future reprint, should it ever come. As it stands, however, they may easily be detected and rectified by the students themselves with the slightest help from the teachers. A very cursory glance will show that the work of transliteration, undoubtedly a matter of paramount importance in annotated editions of Sanskrit books, has not been satisfactory in the present volume, owing to utter lack of facility for it in the press I have had to work with. Suggestions for improvement in both form and matter of this edition will be gratefully received.

**INTRODUCTION**  

**Kālidāsa—His Life and Writings**

**His Life.**

 The individuality and personal history of Kālidāsa, "the brightest luminary in the firmament of Sanskrit literature," is shrouded in obscurity. The poet also, purposely as it were, observes perfect reticence about his identity. Even the most strenuous search in his vast works or in their exegesis by well-known commentators has failed to discover even a solitary passage that may unfold a chapter of his life.

 The story extant about him describes him as having begun his life as an impossible booby, who, nevertheless, got married to a highly learned princess by the machination of some scholars. These Pundits had long been meditating revenge upon the princess for having utterly defeated them in a literary bout, and now succeeded in foisting upon her an unlettered idiot as her husband, having undoubtedly boosted him up as a young man of remarkable scholarship and outstanding parts. He, however, was turned out of the palace by his royal bride on the very night of marriage, when his real character was revealed by his failing to pronounce '**उष्ट्र**', and mumbling '**उट्र**' and '**उष्ट**' instead.**![](../books_images/U-IMG-1736595262Capture2.PNG)** Thus dismissed, he wandered about and did *askesis* to please Sarasvatī, the Goddess of Learning, or the Goddess Kāli, as another tradition has it. The Goddess invoked, appeared before him and granted him in grace a divine boon of knowledge and poetical powers.

business, he, to the utter amazement of his consort, to whom the word was conveyed, replied in correct Sanskrit,**“अस्ति कश्चित् वाग्विशेषः।”** The princess however would not admit him until he could satisfy her with incontrovertible evidence of learning, and this he did later on by writing books beginning with each of the words uttered in that speech. Thus were born the four immortal works, **कुमारसम्भव, मेघदूत, रघुवंश** and **ऋतुसंहार**।¹ In his later life the tradition connects him with the great literary figures—the "gems"—of the court of Vikramāditya². "Though it has not proved possible", says Prof. Ryder, "to identify this monarch with any of the known rulers, there can be no doubt that he existed and had the character attributed to him. The name 'Vikramāditya'—Sun of Valour—is probably not a proper name, but a title like Pharaoh or Tsar. No doubt Kālidāsa intended to pay a tribute to his patron, the Sun of Valour, in the very title of his play *Urvas'ī Won by Valour* **(विक्रमोर्व्वशीयम्)[^3]”**

**Birth-place.**

 The zeal and enthusiasm with which he describes the temple of Mahākāla, the S'iprā and many other things of Ujjain, the exhortation of the Yakṣas to the clouds not to go to Alakā without visiting Ujjain, are, according to many, sufficient proof of his having been an inhabitant of Ujjain³.

of the great poet an attempt to prove that Kālidāsa was a Bengalee by birth.

**Kālidāsa—a Bengalee ?**

 It has been advanced in support of this contention that *Ka'lida'sa* is a *common* Bengali name, and that his birth-place is somewhere in *Navadvīpa*. But the validity of such an argument is to be questioned when the name *Ka'lida'sa* is often met with amongst the Guzeratis^(**1**). One fact, however, strikes us much,—though any deduction from it must be hazardous,—that, in all the vast range of his works Kālidāsa mentions the name of Bengal only once[^4]. Not even the brilliant bridal assemblage in the sixth canto of *Raghuvaṁśa* is adorned by any. Bengali prince, although the potentates of the neighbouring kingdoms, such as Anga, Kalinga, Avantī, Magadha are described with gusto and to the minutest details[^5].

[^5]: "Vide Ra. VI. 20-79."

**Or, a Kashmiree?**

 Dr. Bhau Daji, however, identifies Kālidāsa with Mātrigupta (sixth century), the friend of Vikramâditya, and opines that his birth-place was in Kashmir, and that he is the only Sanskrit poet who describes a living saffron flower, the plant of which grows in Kashmir. He is also supposed by Dr. Bhau to have known the pinches of poverty

. But others think his condition must have been the very reverse of this, as nowhere in his works, is there the slightest indication of his having ever been frowned upon by the goddess of fortune.

 Dr. Bhau also thinks that he belonged to the Brāhmaṇa

caste and was a *Gauḍa Sārasvata*, but he has not adduced sufficient reason in support of his hypothesis.

Religious Views.

 The consensus of scholarly opinion regarding the poet's religious pursuasion appears definitely in favour of the contention that he was a S'aivaite, though by no means a sectarian. In the opening stanzas of each one of his plays he has invoked S'iva^(**1**). The last stanza of *S'akuntalā* has a direct reference to S'iva[^6]. In *Kumāra-sambhava*, S'iva himself is the hero of the play and in **M*egha-dūta* we have a powerful description of a shrine dedicated to S'iva. But that he was not a dogmatic sectarian is plain enough from his ardent and devout references to Viṣṇu in *Raghu*[^7], and also from his catholic views on the trinity—Brahmā, Viṣṇu, S'iva—pointedly expressed in *Kumāra-sambhava*[^8]. Hence it may be safely concluded that Kālidāsa was, in matters of religion, what William James would call *"healthy-minded"*, and emphatically not a *"sick soul"*.

An extensive traveller.

 Kālidāsa seems to have made a 'grand tour', at least in the northern part of India, from the Vindhyās to the Himālayan Plateaus. His accurate description of the kingdoms of Bengal, Behar, Orissa with their sea-coasts and many others, as well as the striking delineation of the operations in burning the ground before sowing[^9], a custom prevalent in Konkan, unmistakably point to the conclusion that he had personally seen those places and scenes[^10]. "It is the mountains that impress him most deeply. His works are full of the Himālayas. Apart from his earliest drama and the slight poem called, *"The Seasons,"* there is not one of them which is not fairly redolent of mountains."[^11] This also would seem to corroborate the idea of poet's wide travels.

His Works.

 The following books have been attributed to Kālidāsa: (1) *Kumára-sambhavam,* (2) *Megha-dūtam,* (3) *Raghu-vans'am,* (4) *Abhijñána-S'akuntalam,* (5) *Vikramorvas'īyam,* (6) *Málávikagnimitram,* (7) *Ritu-samhárah,* (8) *S'riṅga'ra-rasāṣṭakam* (9) *Nalodayam,* (10) *Setu-bandham,* (11) *Kuntes'vara-dautyam,* (12) *S'ruta-budhah,* (13) *Puṣpa-váṇa-vilásam,* (14) *S'riṅga'ra-tilakam,* (15) *Jyotirvida'-varaṇam.* (16) *Ratnakośa,* (17) *S'riṅga'ra-sára-ka'vyam*. The first seven of these according to the scholars, both eastern and western, are undoubtedly his, though regarding the seventh, "Kālidāsa's authorship has been doubted without very cogent argument', says *Prof. Ryder*. "The question is not of much interest, as *The Seasons* would neither add greatly to his reputation nor subtract from it". Of late this question has been taken up by *Sri Aurobindo* in his Age of *Kálidása*, and he has conclusively proved its genuineness. Regarding (11) we are at present not in a position to say anything definitely as the book has not yet been recovered. The Kashmirian scholar Kṣemendra mentions it in his *Aucitya-bicára-carcá*. According to the majority of scholars *Setu-bandham* has also little claim to Kālidāsa's authorship. The rest as well as certain small things, such as, *Odes* to the Ganges, Kālī, Lakṣmī, etc. may be curtly dismissed as not his, despite the nominal identity of the authors of 1, 2, 3, and (15) propounded by Jyotirvidávaraṇam^(**1**). Likely enough, these were products of some later pseudo-Kālidāsas "Who were more concerned for their work than for personal fame"^(**2**).

 In making an estimate of Kālidāsa as a post it is almost needless to remark that his works abundantly testify to a profound scholarship and a versatile poetic genius which in its wide-ranging luminous display exalts thought, delights the

heart and purifies both of dross.

Ka'lida'sa—the Poet.

 A thorough perusal of his works will show that he was an erudite scholar, who was not only acquainted with the literature of his age but also with the important branches of Indian literature, such as the various systems of philosophy, the Upaniṣads, Medicine, ancient laws (of Manu. A'pastamba, etc.), Grammar, Rhetoric, Prosody and dramatics, sure indications of which abound in his works. The second canto of *Kumāra-sambhabam*, for example, contains a smooth and easy handling of the different schools of Hindu philosophy. He was a keen student of the intricate problems of society and had an intimate knowledge of the many conflicting sentiments and emotions of the human heart. The vast range of constructive and reproductive powers of his imagination, as one may find in the 13th canto of *Raghu-vaṁs'am* is, to say the least, amazing.

 His literary style is particularly chaste and simple and lucid and melodious. "It has not in the least the laxity of the sacred poems nor the extravagant colouring of the later poems, and though characterised by brevity, perspicuity runs through every vein of his poetry". Its characteristic feature is a complete freedom from all artificiality, of laboured jingling compounds, involved constructions, the trick of puns which sparkle in straggling heaps in the works of later poets. The style never reflects any conscious premeditation or effort or even subsequent improvement. Kālidāsa is, if anything, the master of felicitous expressions and aptest similes and metaphors. Dr. Wilson does not assuredly speak in hyperboles when he says, "it is impossible to conceive language so beautifully musical and magnificently grand as many of the verses of Bhavabhūti and Kālidāsa". He is commonly referred to as *the poet of love*; yet it must nevertheless be admitted that he could depict with unfailing success the other sentiments too. We find everywhere in his works the suggestion of what is grand and sublime, but he had the power of delineating all shades of character from the utterly divine to the hardly human.

 Among the European students of Kālidāsa, Sir William Jones, assisted by bis teacher Rāma Locana, was the first to bring out a literal translation of *S'akuntalā* into *Latin*, which was reproduced in *English* in Aug. 17, 1788. These translations were



enthusiastically received everywhere in Europe.

**The Western estimate.**

 It was translated into *German* by George Forster in 1791. Jones' translation was quickly caught up almost simultaneously with Forster, by H. West for a *Danish* version in 1793. The French of the same work was produced by A. Bruguière ten years later. Forsters' translation was reproduced in *Dutch* by E. M. Post, Haarlem, almost immediately after Forster's publication itself. The *Italian* rendering by L. Doria, Darmstadt, based on the French of A. Bruguière, came out in 1815, while the *Swedish* by I. E. Ekelund, who consulted Jones and Forster both, appeared six years later. The famous French edition by M. Che'zy came out in 1830. In course of next twenty years another noted *Danish* version by Hammerich and the successive German translations by Dr. Boehtlingk, Hirzel, Rūckert and Meier had placed the fame of the play on a popular basis. Meanwhile Herder and Goethe had received the Forster translation with acclamation, the second edition of which was brought out by Herder in 1803, and in his introductory remarks he bestowed lavish encomiums on the plays of Kālidāsa. "Since that day", says Prof. Ryder, "as is testified by new translations and reprints of the old, there have been many thousands who have read at least one of Kālidās's works; other thousands have seen it on the stage in Europe and America."

 Goethe's now much too famous lines on *S'akuntalā*^(**1**) remain for ever a monumental testimony to the greatness of a poetical

work as may only be appraised by a great poet. Dr. Macdonell has drawn pointed attention to the influence it had on Goethe. "It is a fact worth noting" says he, "that the beginning of one of the most famous European Dramas has been modelled on that of a celebrated Sanskrit play. The prelude of *S'akuntalá* suggested to Goethe the plan of the Prologue on the stage in *Faust*, where the stage-manager, the merryandrew and the poet converse regarding the [play to be performed[^12]," Later on, when Prof. Che'zy sent a copy of his edition of *S'akuntalá*, Goethe, then an old man of eighty, in acknowledging with thanks the receipt of the book wrote to him, on Oct. 1, 1830, *inter alia*, as follows: *"The very first time that I became aware of this unfathomable work, it excited in me such an enthusiasm and attracted me in such a manner that I could not cease studying it again and again.

 I realise only now the profound impression that this work had made upon me at that time. Here appears to us the poet in his highest role as the exponent of the most natural condition, of the finest habits. of the purest moral endeavours, of the worthiest majesty, and of the most earnest contemplation of God: but at the same time he remains to such an extent the lord and master

of his creation,t hat he even ventures to risk vulgar and ridiculous contrasts which, however, must be regarded as the necessary connecting links in the whole scheme of things"[^13].

[^13]: "Winternitz, Geschichte der indischen Literatur. Band III, P. 214."

 Speaking of *S'akuntalā* Dr. Monier Williams of international fame remarks, "No composition of Kālidāsa displays more the richness and fertility of his poetical genius, the exuberance of his imagination, the warmth and play of his fancy, his profound knowledge of the human heart, his delicate appreciation of its most refined and tender emotions, his familiarity with the workings and counter-workings of its confiicting feelings—in short, more entitles him to rank as the "Shakespeare of India". Schiller in a letter to Humboldt writes, "in the whole range of Grecian antiquity there is no poetical representation of beautiful womanhood or of beautiful love that could even remotely compare with *S'akuntalā*[^14]."

[^14]: "Winternitz, Geschichte der indischen Literatur, Band III. S. 215 Anm."

 Again, as has been pointed out by late Harināth De, Bengal's most distinguished linguist, 'the idea of the cloud being employed as a messenger has been imitated in German poetry by Schiller, who, in his drama *Maria Stuart* puts the following appeal in the mouth of the captive Scotish queen:

'Eilende Wolken ! segler der Luefte  
Wer mit euch wanderte, mit euch schiffte  
Gruesset mir freundlich mein Jugendland'  
\[Hurrying clouds ! Ye sailors of the air,  
—O that one could wander and sail with you !  
Greet kindly on my behalf the land of my youth.\]**¹**

 It is not possible to refer here to all such countless remarks of high appreciation poured forth by renowned Western scholars such as, Humboldt, Schlegel, Lassen, Wilson, Sylvain Le'vi and others. It would be a pity to miss the excellent observations of Prof. A. W. Ryder of California, who has himself brought out an admirable translation of Kālidāsa's important works. In the

next three topics we propose to base our remarks on those of Prof. Ryder[^15] maintaining generally the very language of the learned critic.

[^15]: "'Kālidāsa' Introduction III, Pp. XVIII-XIX."

**Kālidāsa—the singer of happy love.**

 'No other poet in any land has sung of happy love between man and woman in the same large way as Kālidāsa has sung. Each one of his works is a love-poem whatever more it may be. Yet the theme is so infinitely varied that the reader never wearies. If one were to doubt from a study of European literatures, comparing ancient with modern works, whether romantic love ever is the expression of a natural instinct, and is not rather a morbid survival of decaying chivalry, he has only to turn to India's independently growing literature to find the question settled. Kālidāsa's love poetry rings as true in our ears as it did in his countrymen's fifteen hundred years ago'. Love in Kālidāsa is comparatively simple, though always deep, earnest, true, at times impassioned. Ebb and flow, secret mean-derings, muddy whirls are not to be found in the storm-tossed or smooth-flowing crystal flood of his love. It may often seem to be too good for this planet of ours, but it is always the one for which the soul of man yearns, dreams and seeks. It is all light, pure and steady, never bedimmed into a smoky flame, never flaring up into a lurid glare, a ruddy incandescence of intolerable heat as in Browning.

**His women appeal more strongly than his men.**

 'It is perhaps an inevitable consequence of Kālidāsa's subject and his manner of handling it, that his women appeal more strongly to a modern reader than his men. The man is the more variable phenomenon, and though manly virtues are the same in all countries and in all ages, emphasis has always been variously laid on some of them in preference to others. But the true woman seems timeless, universal. We know of no poet, unless it be Shakespeare, who has given the world a group of heroines so individual yet so universal; heroines as true, as tender, as self-less as are Indumatī, Sitā, Pārvatī, the Yakṣa's bride and S'akuntalā'.

 One other thing sharply arrests the attention of a student of



Kālidāsa.

**His Boys.**

 "It would be difficult to find anywhere lovelier pictures of childhood than those in which our poet presents the little Bharata (Sarvadamana), A'yus, Raghu, Kumāra. It is a fact worth noticing that his children are all boys. Beautiful and all-important as his women are, he never does more than glance at a little girl".

**Nature in Kālidāsa's poetry.**

 As in the works of most great poets, ancient or modern, in those of Kālidāsa too, Nature plays an all too indispensable part. But again, as each of these great poets has associated himself with nature with a bias and an insight characteristic to him and to no other, so to Kālidāsa has an altogether different consciousness about the various presentation of external nature—a study of which seems to reassure one about the amplitudinous breadth of Nature-vision coupled with an unfailing intimacy with her inner spirit, which lifts up a work like *S'akuntalá* to the very primal dignity of Nature's own. Nature in Kālidāsa has always her double aspect. He loves to tell out with an assiduity and relish, unintelligible to the matter-of-fact moderner, each little detail of a natural scenery, as if, there is not a sapling, not an yeanling, not a boulder, not the smallest brook, not the drabbest gray of colour, not the faintest throb of sound but has a meaning that enriches the enchanted existence in his world. More like Tennyson in this than any other European poet, his wealth of observed fact and form of nature is as inexhaustible as accurate in the details.

 But the outer aspects of nature derive all their magnetic virtues from the poet's inner perception of Nature-life. Indeed, this faith in life of nature must have been so living and dynamic in him as to impel him to a creation in *S'akuntalá* of an animated world of nature cut off clean from human influences—a world, however, none the less complete, varied, sweet or real on that account. This perception of life in nature has, however, to be very properly distinguished from that of some modern poets, who are in a great measure responsible for a sympathetic understanding of nature common in these days. Kālidāsawas not a poet of nature in the sense in which Wordsworth, Shelley or Keats was. Neither a high moral sense, nor an abstract idealism, nor a powerful æsthetic sensuousness characterises his



knowledge of Nature. In his works nature is too stolidly real to be so sublimated; but she is simply Nature, a separate entity, a distinct personality. who associates with man as any other human being does in every-day life of common fellowship, yet at all points touching man with her soul. Man loses his way and enters her domain and wanders about as in a dream. There the conviction grows on him as on Duṣyanta that the trees and the flowers and the brooks and the creatures all around are instinct with conscious personal life, each an individual capable of human fellow-ship. Civilization artificial with its cross-fetters of man-made laws drops off from him like a scale, and he lives and moves in utter freedom in a newer civilization of Nature's own, where the conflicts of individual existence have subsided in the harmony of self-impelled movements of a deeper, natural life.

**Balance in Ka'lida'sa's Character.**

 While we are on this subject of Nature, it is worth while to point to a wonderful balance and fullness in Kālidāsa's character. The glorious life of Nature and the equally glorious life of Man balance themselves and enter in his composition in a perfect chemical process. It is hard to find another poet to compare him with in this. 'Even Shakespeare with all his insight into the charms of Nature is primarily a poet of the human heart. This can hardly be said of Kālidāsa, as it cannot be said of him that he is primarily a poet of Nature.' He is both at the same time, and at no moment can it be said of him that he is principally the one and not the other. The point we are endeavouring to make is beautifully illustrated in *The Cloud Messenger*. The first half of this wonderful poem is ostensibly a description of external nature, yet every line there palpitates with the throb of a beating heart: the latter half is a picture of the human heart with all its tender and moving emotions, but the picture is framed in nature's beauty. So exquisitely and dexterously is the mingled fabric woven that nobody would like to separate the constituents nor commit himself to a preference for either of the two parts over the other.

 In all his many works there is hardly any mention of the poets who preceded Kālidāsa in time. There is only one place where the names of three poets occur, viz., Bhāsa, Saumillaka



and Kaviputra[^16].

[^16]: "प्रथितयशसां भास-सौमिल्लक-कविपुत्रादीनां &c.—Mála I."

**Ka'lida'sa and Bha'sa.**

 Nothing is definitely known about the last two persons beyond that Prof. Bhide identifies them with 'Ramila' and 'Somila', the courtpoets of S'ûdraka, as mentioned by the poet Rājas'ekhara^(**1**). So we cannot ascertain with any amount of certainty the influence exerted by the writings of these two poets on Kālidasa. But a perusal of the works of Bhāsa, discovered by Mahāmahopādhyāya T. Gaṇapati S'āstrī M. A. of Trivandrum, will seem to indicate that our poet is indebted to his writings for very many fine ideas. Such of them as occur in *Sa'kuntala'* have been pointed out in proper places. Inquisitive readers might profitably refer to S'āstri's Introduction to *Svapna-vāsavadatta'* and *Pratima'* in this connection.

 It must be noted here that we keep ourselves absolutely open in regard to the controversy that has been arousedon this question^(**2**). The alleged works of Bha'sa have been, in the first

place, discredited altogether as spurious. A class of scholars have definitely set their faces against the acceptance of these works as products of Bhâsa. They have pointed to the fact that there is no mention of the author in any of these plays. There are others who while preferring to remain indecisive on the question of their authenticity are of opinion that they must have been the works of an author who came later than Kālidāsa, and who it is, and not Kálidāsa, that must be held the debtor. A third class of critics relegate these plays to an even inferior position of mere dramatic anthologies collated from various masterpieces for the popular *Kerala* stage in South India. European as well as Indian scholars may be found in each of these schools of opinion; and all that may be said at this stage on this controversy is that it is still in far too nebulous state to warrant a text-maker to hitch on to any of these beliefs. We have thought it accordingly advisable to proceed on the assumption of their authenticity, while the controversial storm should subside and a definite conclusion is arrived at.

**Kālidāsa and Bhavabhūti.**

 Opinions vary as to the relative superiority of Kālidāsa and Bhavabhūti. Leaving aside the disputations of the Pundits, we shall in the following lines note the chief difference between the two^(**1**). Undoubtedly both were great poets. But what gives Kālidāsa the position of pre-eminence among poets is the versatility of his genius. In drama as well as in epic and lyric poetry he is equally at his best. Himself a poet of a high order, Bhavabhūti cound not completely divest himself of the magical influence of Kālidāsa's poetry, and his great indebtedness to his illustrious predecessor for many of his finest ideas and images is brought out by a careful study of his masterpiece the Uttara-Rāma-caritam. But even where he has borrowed, he has not failed to leave the stamp of his own genius. The materials he borrowed are presented in a manner all his own, and the touch of his imagination so transforms them that they appear, not as mere repetitions and reproductions, but as

entirely novel and original. The difference between the two great artists, however, comes out most prominently in their manner of depicting natural sights and sounds and the play of passions and sentiments as well as in the nature of imagery used by each. In Kālidāsa, the descriptions are characterised by a terseness and power of suggestion that adds to the charm of his poetry, while Bhavabhūti is painfully elaborate and prolix in his descriptions. With the true insight of an artist Kālidāsa finishes his picture with just a few significant touches, leaving the details to be supplied by the imagination of the reader. Bhavabhūti, on the other hand, spares no pains to make his picture complete even to the minutest detail, so that the reader has hardly to exercise his imagination to understand and appreciate it. "The former *suggests* or *indicates* the sentiment, while the *latter expresses* in forcible language. The characters of the latter overcome by force of passion often weep bitterly, while those of the former simply shed a few tears, if they do so at all. In the language of Sanskrit critics Kālidāsa's *rasa* is conveyed or *abhibyakta* by the *lakṣya* or the *vyangya* sense of words, while Bhavabhūti's is conveyed by "*Vācya*" sense.[^17].")

[^17]: "R. G. Bhandarkar, Mālati. (Preface

 The other distinguishing feature of Kālidāsa's poetry is the aptness and the beauty of his similes and it is here that he stands without a rival. Kālidāsa compares the familiar and the concrete to other familiar and concrete object, and that why his similes have a direct appeal to the mind of the reader. Bhavabhūti, on the other hand, delights in comparing the familiar and the concrete to the remote and the abstract, with the result that his similes appear to be rather farfetched and obscure and can not readily fascinate the reader. "There is more passion in the thought of Bhavabhūti than in those of Kālidāsa, but less fancy. There are few of the elegant similitudes in which the latter is so rich and there is more that is common-place and much that is strained and obscure. In none of his dramas does Bhavabhūti make any attempt at wit and we have no character in either of his three dramas approaching the Vidūṣaka. On the other hand he expatiates more largely in the description of human emotions and is perhaps entitled to even a higher place than his rival as a poet[^18]."

[^18]: "Dr. H. H. Wilson."



**The Date of Kālidāsa**

 There are conflicting opinions regarding the actual date of Kālidāsa. He has been dragged by the scholars from century to century, from 800 B. C. to 1200 A. D^(**1**). *M. Hippolyte Fauche*, who published a French translation of the complete works of Kālidāsa *supposes*[^19] that Kālidāsa lived at the time of the posthumous child of the king Agnivarṇa mentioned in the 19th canto of the *Raghu-vaṁs'am*. This places the poet, at the latest in the 8th century B. C. But the style of Kālidāsa is certainly not so old as to belong to a period earlier than Paṇini (750 B. C.), the great grammarian. Besides, M. Fauche's conjecture is not supported by any historical evidences, so it is dismissed without serious consideration.

[^19]: "Saturday Review, January, 1860."

**Earliest mention of Ka'lida'sa.**

 *Kṣīrasvāvmī*, the oldest commentator of *Amarakoṣa* (8th century A. D.), and *Kumārila Bhaṭṭa* (8th century A. D.) the great Mimānsaka philosopher^(**2**) quote from Kālidāsa. The author of *Gauḍa-badha* (8th century (A. D.) calls our poet as "*Raghu-ka'ra.*" *Ba'ṇa-bhaṭṭa* the court-poet of Śilāditya II (650 A. D.) eulogises Kālidāsa in his *Harṣa-Carita*[^20]. All these facts may be adduced to explode the 10th and 12th century theories, while the *earliest mention* of our poet in *"Aihole Inscription"* of Pulakeśi II, dated Saka. 556.

**Renaissance Theory.**

 Dr. Max Muller opines[^21] that in consequence of the incessant incursions of the Hunas, Scythians and other foreigners, there was a *literary interregnum* during the first two centuries A. D. He believes that Sanskrit went to sleep, for nearly six centuries from the rise of Buddhism in the fifth century B. C. to the establishment of the Gupta Empire in the fourth century A. D. Dr. Muller's view is that in the middle of the sixth century, the reign of the king Vikramāditya of Ujjain, whose court is said to have been adorned by nine gems, of whom Kālidāsa was the chief, was the Augustan age of Sanskrit Literature. But this theory has been totally exploded by the *Girna'ra* and *Na'sika* inscriptions, and by the epigraphical evidences which not only prove conclusively that Sanskrit Literature flourished before the Christian era but show incontrovertibly that it was not dormant but that it continued in culture during the succeeding centuries[^22].

[^21]: "India what can it teach us."

[^22]: "Dr. Macdonell's History of Sanskrit Literature."

**Korur Theory.**

 The Renaissance theory of Dr. Muller is chiefly based upon the hypothesis of Mr. Fergusson who holds that Vikrama Era was founded in 544 A. D. by the king Vikramāditya to commemorate his victory over the S'ákas in the battle of Korur dating the commencement of the era 600 years back to 57 B. C. But this hypothesis of Fergusson has been exploded by the research of Mr. Fleet of Bombay Civil Service who has shown that the Vikrama era of 57 B. C. far from being founded in 544 A. D. had already been in use a century before under the name of Mālava era. Besides no Śakas could have been driven out of western India in the middle of the sixth century, because that country had been already conquered by the Guptas more than a hundred years before. Lastly it turns out that though other foreigners, the Hunas, were actually expelled from western India in the

first half of the Sixth Century, they were driven out not by Vikramāditya but by a king named Yaśodharma Viṣṇubardhana.

**Dignāga Theory.**

 Hiouen Thsang, the Chinese traveller mentions two individuals *Āryasānga* and *Vasubandhu* who lived about 541 A. D. A certain Dignāga was Vasubandhu's pupil. Dr. Muller and some others are of opinion that Dignāga, a hatred rival of our poet, has been mentioned by Kālidāsa in the 14th stanza of *Megha-dūtam* in terms of banter[^23]. Hence, "we shall probably", says Dr. Muller, "now feel confident in placing Kālidāsa in the middle of the Sixth Century". But against this Dr. Macdonell remarks—The explanation to begin with, is extremely dubious in itself. Then it is uncertain whether Mallinâtha (following Dakṣiṇāvarta)^(**1**) means the Buddhist teacher Dignāga. Thirdly, little weight can be attached to the Buddhistic tradition that Dignāga was a pupil of Vasubandhu, for this statement is not found till the sixteenth century. Then the assertion that Vasubandhu belongs to the sixth century depends chiefly on the Vikramāditya theory and is opposed to the Chinese evidence which indicates that works of Vasubandhu were translated in A. D. 404. Thus every link in the chain of argument is very weak. Again if Dignāga be naturally a hatred rival of Kālidāsa and be ridiculed in a contemptuous way in that śloka as Mallinâtha observes, the plural number in the way seems to be quite unjustifiable and a serious incongruity[^24]. Moreover, one has to explain why Ballabha Deva, one of the oldest commentators, does not touch the question at all.

mentioned by Kalhana, the author of Rājataraṅgiṇī) who was placed for a short period on the throne of Kashmere^(**1**) by Harṣa Vikrama of Ujjain after the death of Hiraṇya (Sixth Century A. D.).

**Mātrigupta alias Kālidāsa.**

 Dr. Bhau himself, however, does not appear to be certain of his doctrine of the identity. His language meekly presses the suggestion forward and leaves it to take its own chances at the hands of the critics. One very striking thing is this that Kalhana mentions Mātrigupta but he does not name a single of the renowned works of our poets. Again, it has also been said that *Setubandham* is a work actually written by Mātrigupta on the occasion of building a pontoon bridge across the Vitastā (Hydaspes) by Pravarasena. But no reliable evidence has been forthcoming to identify Pravarasena and his work of building the bridge. All that there is in this connection is loose tradition. Bāṇabhaṭṭa's assumption of this Pravarasena with the book *Setubandham*[^25] leads us nowhere. For neither, the author of *Ka'vya'dars'a* (Daṇḍī) nor that of *Sa'hityadarpaṇa* (Vis'vanātha Kavirāja) makes mention of Kālidāsa as being the author of this book. Rāma Sarmā has, it is known, found an allusion to the disputed authorship somewhere in *Va'ra'ṇasī- darpaṇa* of Sundara, but then the Kālidāsa he refers to may be any of the three Kālidāsas known to Rājas'ekhara, the probability being definitely against our poet. Kālidāsa and Mātrigupta are certainly two different persons as they are differently quoted by Kṣemendra, other writers and commentators.

**Sixth Century Theory.**

 Mr. K. B. Pāthaka and others in vain lay stress upon some internal evidences in the book for placing the poet in the sixth century. For the mention of Hunas[^26] in the *Raghu-vaṁs'am* does not prove anything. The names of Huna and various other Mleccha tribes we find even in the Mahābhārata and the

Rāmāyaṇa^(**1**). Prof. R. N. Āpte has shown that just beyond the threshold of India (*Bactria*) the Hunas had a powerful kingdom from 300 B. C. to the end of the Ist or 2nd Century A. D. The same scholar has shown that the supposed astronomical references have really no astronomical significance at all.

**Sk. Jāmitra and Gk. Diametron.**

 It has also been argued that the word *Ja'mitra (Ku. VII.I.)* is taken from the Greek "*Diametron*" which was borrowed by Āryabhaṭṭa *(499 A. D.)* in his astronomical works. This places Kālidāsa after Āryabhaṭṭa. Principal S. Roy has clearly proved that *Jámitra* (a pure sanskrit word) does not suit the context in the sense of Gr. Diametron.[^27]

 Mr. Harināth De, the renowned linguist and Mr. B. C. Mazumdar (J. R. A. S. 1909, Page 731) find covert references to the Gupta Kings in the works of our poet. Hence the poet must have flourished during the reign of Candra Gupta (II) Vikramāditya and that of his son Kumāra Gupta. The following references according to them are sufficient to corroborate the above statement;—

 *(The victory and horse-sacrifice of Raghu identified with the horse-sacrifice and conquest of Samudra Gupta).* It is very easy to see that the supposition is based on a very weak hypothesis, for, if we take into account the fancy of the Sanskrit writers for the use of the root **'गुप'** instead of**'रक्ष'** it will not be very difficult to prove the most antique Sanskrit works as belonging to the Gupta period.

**Mandasor Inscription.**

 Examining the contents of the Mandasor Inscription discovered by Dr. Fleet, Dr. Macdonell opines that *Vatsabhaṭṭi*, the composer of these 40 stanzas to commemorate the consecration of a temple of the Sun at Das'apura, must have *intimately* known our poet and utilised his works immensely.

**Kālidāsa cannot be placed laterthan the 5th Century.**

 The inscription is dated 473 A. D., hence Kālidāsa cannot be placed later than the 5th century A. D. This is also corroborated by the following facts: The King Bhoja in his *Sarasvatī-Kaṇṭhá-varaṇa* quotes from *Bha'maha*, the great rhetorician (who is believed to have flourished in the 5th century), who in his turn quotes from Kālidāsa. Again the commentator *Avinīta* wrote his commentary on the 15 cantos of Bhāravi's *Kira'ta'rjunīyam* in 470 A. D. Thus Bhāravi cannot be placed later than the 5th Century A. D. which fact places Kālidāsa in an earlier period still.

**Orthodox view or the B. C. Theory.**

 It now remains to examine the orthodox view regarding the age of Kālidāsa. A time-honoured tradition makes Kālidāsa the court-poet of some Vikramāditya in the 57 B. C. The author of *Jyotirvida'varaṇam* identifies himself with Kālidāsa, the author of *Raghu-vaṁs'am*, *Kuma'ra-sambhavam* and *Megha-dūtam* and the court-poet of Vikramāditya, and says that this present work of his was begun in 33 B. C.—

 A careful study of the language, and astronomical references will clearly show that **ज्योतिर्विदाभरण** is a book of much later date and written by some pseudo-Kālidāsa. Besides, there is considerable difference in language and style between this book and *Raghu-vaṁs'am or Kuma'ra-sambhavam.* But then, a pertinent question would suggest itself as to why this deception should have been played by the author of this book. What made the *early era* with which he would like himself to be associated so dangerously attractive? The only plausible explanation is that there was a Kālidāsa who wrote *Raghu-vaṁs'am, Kuma'ra,* and *Megha-dūtam* and that he lived before the birth of Christ, and that the author of **ज्योतिर्विदाभरण** assumes the name of Kālidāsa and identifies himself with the author of *Raghu-vaṁs'am*, with the hope that his book might pass for one of that famous Kālidāsa's.

**Bhita Medallion of the Suṅga Dynasty.**

 The terra-cotta medallion found by Dr. Marshall in a village named Bhita, near Allahabad[^29] pictures a scene which looks exactly like the opening scene of *S'akuntala'*, where the king Duṣyanta was entreated by two hermits not to kill the stag and *S'akuntalā* was watering the plants at a distance. The medallion has been assigned to the Sunga period (185 B. C.—73. B. C.). This fact corroborates the orthodox theory¹.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



**Peculiar Law of Inheritance.**

 Internal evidence from the works of Kálidása will also point to the same conclusion. In the Sixth Act of *S'akuntala'* the king Duṣyanta is informed by his minister that the property of a certain merchant Dhanamitra by name, who died childless, will revert to the state and not to his widow. This[^30] sort of peculiar law of inheritance is of very antique date and the prevalence of such custom at the time of the poet places him before the birth of Christ.

[^30]: "218 n. 4."

**Penalty for Theft.**

 The infliction of capital punishment on prigs stealing gems[^31] also tends to the same conclusion. The frequent deviation from Páṇini's Grammar, the preponderancy of Vedic forms[^32] and the absence of pun and long compounds which are the peculiar traits of the later poets such as Bhavabhüti, Bāṇavaṭṭa and others, places him also in a very early date.

**As'vaghoṣa and Kālidāsa.**

 As'vaghoṣa, the author of *Buddha-carita. Saurindana-ka'vya*, and *Sutra'lanka'ra &c*. must have lived some time in the beginning of the Christian era, for a Chinese translation of Buddha-carita had appeared in the 5th century A.D. as is known from the writings of Hiouen Theang and I-Tsing. A careful perusal of his works will show his skill of adapting others' thoughts. He has not only borrowed ideas from Bhása¹ but has also numerous passages similar to those in Kālidāsa's works. This led the occidental scholars such as Cowell[^33] Keith[^34], and Hillebrandt to think that Kālidāsa borrowed from As'vaghoṣa, But Principal Roy's research has totally demolished this theory and has conclusively proved the indebtedness of As'vaghoṣa

to Kālidāsa and the priority of the latter to the former. We need only add the evidence of style to demarcate between the two authors. As'vaghoṣa is doubtless simple and practically shorn of artificiality in style. But while he would freely employ like Bhaṭṭi alliteration and verbs in **लुङ्, लिट्** and desiderative, Kálidása[^35] is sparse in his use of these little tricks and gives no evidence of deflecting the spontaneous flow of his style in such forced channels.

**Puṣply)amitra, Agnimitra and Vasumitra.**

 In *Ma'la'*, mention is made of historical persons such as Puṣpamitra, Agnimitra, and Vasumitra. In 185, B. C. Puṣpamitra, the General of the Maurya Kings[^36] slew his master Brihadratha, usurped his throne and founded what is known as the Sunga dynasty which lasted till 73. B. C. He was a great ruler, conquered several countries and had a tough struggle with the Greeks under Menander. His son Angnimitra was made the Governor of Vidis'ā, capital of **दशार्ण**[^37] Puṣpamitra performed the famous horse-sacrifice (**अश्वमेध**) and the duty of guarding the horse was entrusted to Agnimitra's son, who discharged it successfully and well by vanquishing certain Yavana troops who had ventured to challenge him. "The performance of the solemn rite probably was witnessed", says Dr. Smith, "by the celebrated grammarian Patañjali, who alludes to the event in terms which imply that it occurred in his time." From the mention of these persons and the close resemblance of the above facts with the horse-sacrifice of Dilīpa and the conquests of Raghu, one would like to believe that Kālidāsa was contemporary of those persons. From the peculiar form of the *Bharata-va'kya* of the *Ma'la'*¹, the learned Commentator Kiṭayavema opines that the play was written and staged during the reign of the King Agnimitra or, in other words

Kalidasa was his court poet¹. Again, the concluding phrase, of the **भरतवाक्य**, viz., **'गोप्तरि अग्निमित्रे'** being in the locative (*nominative absolute*) argues the present existence of a ruler named Agnimitra. Besides, the opening śloka of the same play² conveys indirectly the same impression. There is presumably a pun on the word **पुराणम्** and the suggestion is clear that the dramatist intends to make a departure from the well-known principle of **नाटकं ख्यातवृत्तं स्यात्** and introduces a reigning monarch as the hero of his play instead of some personality from past history. All this supported by the Bhita Medallion makes out an irresistable case for the orthodox theory.

**The Play**

 Like the two other greatest Indian poets, viz., S'rī Harṣa[^38] and Bhavabhūti[^39], Kālidāsa wrote only three dramas[^40] of which *Abhijña'na-S'akuntalam* is a love drama and belongs to that class of 'Rūpaka' which is known as **नाटक**।

**Source of the play.**

 It is based on the well-known story of Duṣyanta and S'akuntalā, as is told in the Ādiparva of the Mahābhārata (ch. 67-74), a succint survey of which is given below.

**The story of the Mahābhārata.**

 Dusyanta, king of *Pratiṣṭha'na* and scion of the lunar dynasty, in course of his hunting excursion came to the hermitage of Kaṇva who was at that time out for gathering fruits; but his adopted daughter S'akuntalā, alone in the cottage, hospitably received him. At the sight of her, the king was smitten with

love and asked her about her parentage, whereupon she herself made a clean breast of all about her birth-story. Knowing her to be a king's daughter, the king without any further ceremony asked for her hand in marriage. The king promising to appoint her son his successor, she gave consent and was consequently wedded according to the Gāndharva form of marriage. The king apprehending the sage's anger[^41], as permission had not been sought from him, very soon left the hermitage.

[^41]: "Ādi. 73.23."

 A little after, the sage returned to the cottage and divining what had transpired in his absence gratulated S'akuntalā on her choice[^42]. The king when he returned to his capital dared not send for S'akuntalā, being afraid of the sage's anger[^43]. In the meantime S'akuntalā who was enceinte gave birth, at the end of *three years*, to a son, who even at the age of six years became very turbulent and harassed the wild beasts and consequently he was named *"Sarvadamana."*[^44] At this time the sage thought it high time for him to go to his father's place and be duly installed as Yuvarāja (heir-apparent)[^45]. Consequently Śakuntalā with Sarvadamana being escorted by some disciples went to the king's place. The king remembering every thing, yet perhaps, through fear of public calumny denied having any connexion with her¹. At that critical juncture an aerial voice corroborated the statement made by S'akuntalâ and enjoined the king to welcome her as his legal wife. Then the king received S'akuntalā, made her the chief queen and Sarvadamana became the Yuvarāja. Such a simple and unromantic story is certainly suited to that oldest time when the Mahābhārata was written, for its author merely intended to relate a bit of past history and he did it in a dry and unostentatious way. But our poet like Shakespeare who rarely originated the main plot of his dramas, handled this prosaic story of the Mahābhārata so ingeniously and with such innovations that the dry skeletons of the Mahā-

bhārata story have been, as it were, filled with flesh and breath and vitalised for ever.

**Deviation from the Original.**

 Even at the outset we have ample instance of his foresightedness. In the original, the king in course of his hunting excursions, accompanied by his big army, minister and hierophant[^46] came to the hermitage of Kaṇva and he at once entered it and kept the whole party waiting outside all the while he talked with S'akuntalā and married her,—as their presence might hamper the further progress of the plot. In *Sa'kuntala'*, however, the entrance of the king is perfectly natural. The king while keenly pursuing a deer outstripped his retinues and came to the said hermitage. This straying away of the king from his army has been utilised by our poet in depicting a dramatic finis of the first act, for the retinues not finding the king, rummaged the whole forest, entered the hermitage of Kaṇva and made a great row while the king was deeply absorbed in conversing with S'akuntalā and her friends. The king perhaps liked to prolong his conversation *ad infinitum*, but there was a call from his higher duty of succouring the distressed and though unwilling he at once left them only to remove the chaotic condition of the hermitage and thus to pacify the denizens of the penancewood[^47].

[^46]: "73.35."

[^47]: "Before 52n."

 Again in the original S'akuntalā received her guest, exchanged words with the king and herself gave a detailed account of her parentage[^48]. Her nature thus depicted smells a bit coquettish. But our poet, who certainly possessed the faculty of imagination in a higher degree. felt the necessity of some companions for dramatic action and thus created the two sweet innocent disinterested friends in the form of Anasūyā and Priyamvadā, the conversation with the king being carried on through these friends. Even a superficial reader cannot but be amazed with the dramatic ingenuity which is manifested in the

[^48]: "उवाच हसन्ती वाक्यं ... ॥ यथायमागमो मह्यं ... । शृणु राजन् यथातत्त्वं यथास्मि दुहिता मुनेः॥"



method in which the said conversation with occasional jokes was carried on. Again, S'akuntalā's love for the king at the first sight, her surprise at the change of her feeling antagonistic to penance-life and her bashfulness have also been delightfully depicted. The king's amazement at the beauty of S'akuntalā, the gradual disclosure of his passion for the girl, his dramatic approach near the two, when S'akuntalā was attacked by a bee, have also been so been artistically delineated.

 In the original as soon as the king became aware of S'akuntalā's parentage, he proposed to marry her[^49]. She however requested the king to wait a few minutes till her father who had gone out to gather fruits, would come back[^50]. Our poet however considering a few hours to be too small a space of time to persuade a girl, quite ignorant of love affairs, to consent to marry *a novus homo*, deliberately made Kaṇva absent from the field of play for several months on a pilgrimage to Soma-tīrtha. This transmutation of Kaṇva's absence for a few minutes into several months is also a clear sign of our poet's foresight, for it prolongs the king's stay in the hermitage to protect the sacrifices of the ascetics disturbed by the malignants and thus enables the king to progress with his love affairs. Before solemnizing the Gāndharva marriage of the two haphazardly as is found in the original, our poet created the second and third acts with a view to depicting the gradual love-lorn conditions of our hero. With a view to breaking the dull monotony of the scene by some comic element and also to stopping the hunting excursion and devising some means for king's progressing with the amorous affair with S'akuntalā, Vidūṣaka. the jester-confidant of the king is introduced, though he has been wisely kept within his bounds and made to play a much smaller part in this drama than in the earlier works of Kālidāsa.

[^49]: "72.1."

[^50]: "72.5."

 In the third act and its prologue, we have a vivid picture of the love-sick king, and S'akuntalā afflicted with love-malady. Even in such a stage her innate bashfulness, the conflict of emotions in her heart when confronted with two opposing duties and her modesty please us extremely. Unlike the original where the wedlock of the two were settled by this condition



that the son of S'akuntalā would be the possessor of the throne, our poet has dispensed with this sort of selfish bargain[^51].

[^51]: "72. 15-17"

 In the original Kaṇva though aware of the Gāndharva marriage and the pregnancy of S'akuntalá, kept her in his hermitage for *nine years* and then made preparations for sending her to her husband's place. S'akuntalā who seemed not to have any eagerness to meet her husband—nay—who was rather unwilling to leave the hermitage, thought that her *hasty* removal was due to the turbulent nature of his son who was disturbing the peace of the penance-grove[^52]. Besides, a great incongruity prevails in the speech and action of the sage Kaṇva, for there is no justification for what made him—an avower of the principle that a married woman should not stay for a long time in her relative's house[^53]—keep S'akuntalā in the hermitage for such a long period. Kālidāsa, however, noticing all these incongruities, sent S'akuntalā the very day he was aware of the marriage¹ and also before her son was born. Obviously the king's character is thus made to appear in a better light and a greater probability is given to the whole story. The parting scene of *S'akuntala'* from the hermitage where she had resided so long and where every creeper and plant was bound by the tie of love and affection is poet's all own.

[^52]: "25.96"

[^53]: "35.96"

 In the fifth act or the public repudiation of S'akuntalā there is a greater deviation from the original. In the *Maha'bha'rata* the king deliberately feigns ignorance of the Gândharva mariage and repudiates his forest-bride with abuses². Kālidāsa, however, with a view to absolve him from the moral responsibility in his rejection of S'akuntalā, ingeniously introduced the episode of Durbāsā's imprecation clouding the king's memory. Certainly this is the greatest of all his innovations. "That there may be an ultimate recovery of memory, the curse is so modified as to

last only until the king shall see again the ring which he has given to his bride. To the Hindu, curse and modifications are matters of frequent occurrence; and Kālidāsa has so delicately managed the matter as not to shock even a modern and western reader with a feeling of strong improbability. Even to us it seems a natural part of the divine cloud that envelops the drama, in no way obscuring human passion, but rather giving to human passion an unwonted largeness and universality".[^54]

Durbasa's cursedevelops love for flesh into commingling of souls.

[^54]: "A. W. Ryder, Kālidāsa, P, 101."

 We shall presently deal at length with the deeper meaning of this curse,—how it rectifies S'akuntalâ by purifying her of the gross materialism of her love and how it ennobles the character of Duṣyanta and develops an earthly love into divine love. Almost every line of Acts VI and VII save the idea of the turbulent nature of Sarva-damana, is original and is depicted in a masterly way[^55]. Such is the charm and mastery of this concluding part of the play that even Bhavabhūti in his masterpiece has found it worth his while to somewhat closely follow the model. In *Uttara-ra'ma-carita* Sitā's banishment and the pathetic wailing of her royal husband, the supernatural element, the scenic description, the surge of affection and yearning towards the unknown child of one's own loins must have derived much of their pathos and splendour from the inspiration awakened by this portion of *S'akuntala'*.

[^55]: "116n. Remark."

**The story of Padma-purāṇa materially thesame.**

 The story given in the Padma-purāṇa, Svarga-khanda, is almost exactly the same as it is found in the drama of S'akuntalā. Theking's pursuing of a stag, importunities of the disciples of Kaṇva not to kill the stag of the hermitage, the meeting of the king with S'akuntalā and her friends when they were watering the plants, Anasūyā's description of the birth and parentage ofS'akuntalā, Duṣyanta's marriage with S'akuntalā according to the Gāndharva system, his presentation of his signet-ring to S'akuntalā, the imprecation of the choleric sage Durbāsā, Priyamvadā's propitiation of the sage Durbāsā (Act IV.), Kaṇva's sending of S'akuntalā to her husband's place accompanied by S'āradvata, S'ārṅgarava, and Gautamī &c. his address



to the denizens of the hermitage (Act IV), king's astonishment at the sight of a beautiful woman in the midst of hermits and his non-recognition of S'akuntalā (Act V), the latter's inability to produce the signet-ring, the priest's proposal of keeping S'akuntalā in his own house until delivery, S'akuntalā's removal by Menakâ in the shape of a light, while she bemoaning her ill-luck was following the priest to his house (Act V), the ring-episode where the token ring was found in possession of a fisherman who was bound on a charge of theft (Act VI **प्रवेशक**), king's repentance at the sight of the ring, the story of the merchant Dhanamitra who died in a ship-wreck and one of whose wives was enceinte (Act VI), enhancement of king's grief at the story of the aforesaid merchant and also at his own childlessness (Act VI.), Indra's invitation of the king for chastising the disturbing Dānavas (Act VI), reunion of Duṣyanta with S'akuntalā and her son Sarvadamana who was tormenting a lion-cub in the hermitage of Mārica (Act VII)—all these facts of the drama we find in the *Padma-pura'ṇa*, only a few of the *Dramatis Personæ* such as the Vidūṣaka, Anasūyâ, chamberlain, Sānumatī, portress are absent. We are astonished to find that scholars¹ are not rare even in India, who do not hesitate to opine that Kālidāsa drew his materials from the Padma-puráṇa. This Puráṇa is fraught with bigoted sectarianism and (like the Brahma-vaivarta Purāṇa) contains the name of *Ra'dha'*, which is not only unknown in the Mahâbhárata, but also in such Vaisṇava works as Harivans'a, Kūrma-Purāṇa, Vishṇu-Purāṇa and Srīmad-bhāgabat. Certainly this book, at least as it has reached us in its present state, is of recent date. Even if we accept that the Purāṇa kernel in it is very old, still the story of S'akuntalā in it is surely a later interpolation. This is corroborated by the fact that the Ānandās'ram Edition of PP is bereft of **शकुन्तलोपाख्यान**।Besides the story is very defective and so full of inconsistency that it cannot be accepted as having been composed by Vyāsa, the eminent writer of the Mahābhārata. It is surely the production of some tyro who had both the Mahābhārata and our play

before him. This will be evident even from the language and idiom of the story of PP. The interpolator has, as already shown, closely followed the story of our poet. Only the absence of Kaṇva for gathering fruits and S'akuntalā's extraction of the promise from the king as to her son being made the prince, have been taken verbatim from the Mahābhārata. Of the many defects of the story of the PP., we shall mention only a few which will disclose the capacity of the interpolator.

 Priyamvadā in the *Pura'ṇa* plays animportant part. It is she who gave the king a detaileddescription of her friend's birth, it is she who wasaware of Durbāsā's imprecation and its cessation with the presentation of some token of recognition. Again Priyamvadā according to the *Pura'ṇa* was allowed to accompany S'akuntalá to the court of Duṣyanta. The king, of course, could not recognise S'akuntalā owing to the sage's curse, but the interpolator does not give any reason for king's failure to recognise Priyamvadā. This is certainly awkward, for the imprecation affects S'akuntalā but it should have no effect on Priyamvadā. Besides as in the *Maha'bha'rata*, there is here even no insinuation that the king intentionally did not recognise Priyamvadā (and also S'akuntalā) for fear of public calumny. There is another glaring defect that Priyamvadā who knew every thing about the Gāndharva marriage, spoke not a single word on behalf of S'akuntalā. Again she was fully conscious of the loss of the ring¹ upon which depended the future of S'akuntalā, from her own hand in the water when S'akuntalā hadplaced it in her hand while performing her ablution, but it is very curious that she did neither herself search for the ring nor disclose the matter to her friend or to the sages. S'akuntalā also in a very strange way, after ablution, forgot clean to ask for the souvenir ring. Even a superficial reader will understand the unnaturalness of the

incident if he compares all these with the steps taken by the king Raghu to find out an *amulet* which by chance had slipped into the waters of Sarayū[^56]. Besides the author of the Purāṇa in describing the story of Rāma followed not the Rāmāyaṇa but the *Raghu-vaṁs'am* in its outlines. Sometimes he even paraphrases the wordings of Kālidāsa. This, we think, is sufficient to show that the story of S'akuntalā has been interpolated into the *Pura'ṇa* by a lesser writer of later date.

**The Central Significance Of The Play**

"Wouldst thou the young year's blossoms  
 and the fruits of its decline.  
And all by which the soul is charmed,  
 enraptured, feasted, fed.  
Wouldst thou the earth and heaven itself  
 in one sole name combine ?  
I name thee, O S'akuntalā ! and a॥  
 at once is said".[^57]

 —So says Woolfäng Von Goethe of *Sa'kuntala'.* The insight of Goethe told him what *Sa'kuntala'* was—not merely patches of oriental romance, colourful, delicate, and gorgeous, strung round the central figure of a heroine, coy and delicate, beautiful and charming, but above all sweet and firm. Such undoubtedly S'akuntalā is—and indeed much more—a lily of our valley in all its bloom and beauty and freshness. Had she been merely "a creeper of the forest"—she might have peers but she is more. She is not Miranda, the simple maiden nursed on a sea-girt isle in the company of enslaved nature-spirits like Ariel. She is an embodiment of love that purges itself of the wanton abandon of youth and ripens into the mature steadfastness and dignified bliss of love spiritual. Her life starts as all earthly lives in raptures and pangs, in forgetfulness of the beyond and immersion in the immediate and in a surrender to the senses. It is so far of the earth, earthy. But a little insight should warn you that she is not to stop here,—her birth and life

[^57]: "Translated from the German by E. B. Eastwick."



and training must carry her beyond these. And so her life opens up wide vistas and new,—arid deserts of nothingness and void when all the treacherous bloom and bliss fade away and depart, intense agony of a life first brought face to face with the unmasked reality of the earthly love—then the emerging of the soul in its purity in the Abode of Bliss, in which it is calm, solemn like a prayer and dignified like a goddess. She has passed through the portals of fleshly pleasures to which human steps are bound, she has passed out of the deep and dismal shadow of desertion and dejection in which earthly love must end, and thus through austere *tapasya'* of years and years she at last stands out under the full view of Heaven, as Love stands revealed only when desires have been conquered, earthly brilliance has been replaced by the effulgence of Heaven and the lover has known that the truest way of Love is through *tapasya'*.

 Śakuntalā's life is destined by fate to be the battle-ground of this grand and noble passion. She is the daughter of a Ṛṣi, but she has for her mother an *Apsaras*, and her birth has been She is her possible by a temporary lapse of the ascetic. mother's child—has the beauty and the grace and the gaiety of a heavenly nymph. But is she not truly and moretruly enough—the daughter of a Ṛṣi as well? That strain of asceticism, steadfast ardour for truth does she too share. And indeed in the hermitage of Kaṇva, she has the happiest rearing up that could be desired for her.It is the hermitage of a householder-saint in which the womenfolk are the helpmates of their ascetic husbands, and Nature a true and loyal companion, where peace reigns supreme, flowers bloom in easy naturalness and the deer and other animals are, as it were, man's next kith and kin. The girlhood of Śakuntalā is not hedged in with *don'ts*,—she is not a child brought up in isolation and in ignorance of the world and its ways.To her the *Navamallika'* is a sister, the young frolicking doe a playmate and at her approach the *Kes'ara* tree brightens up;—these keynotes to her character are supplied by Kālidāsa himself in opening her story. But she is not to be a mere Miranda. She has for her companions Anasūyā and Priyaṁvadā—hermitage girls no doubt but not unlettered in the delicate *affaire de cœur*. To her they impart their knowledge as also all their sincerest friendship



of maiden days. So Śakuntalā has had a mind, simple and sincere, but she has been prepared also for being a joyful companion to her future husband, whoever the fortunate man may be. She is young, enjoys being so, as at the very outset we can see, and shares the glow and fervour of all young hearts. She has not been shut out from these natural human sentiments,—she has never been taught that love is a forbidden fruit. She is not a hot-house growth nor is she a parasitical blossom. She has her roots deep in the soil she loves. And hence she has a longing for enjoying the supreme joy of a woman's life, and a heart prepared in the natural environments of the hermitage for giving away the bliss without reserve. This proves to be her fall. She has not the shrewd business sense of the world to bargain when the beloved offers the cup of joy full. The spirit of bargain is foreign to her and the dictates of heart are too sacred to her to be questioned. She drinks it to the dregs without foresight and without fore-thought. To the god of love she is only a delicate doe and an easy victim—just as the friends of her life, the deer of the hermitage, are to the gallant king. When she gives, she gives herself away full and complete, pays Love royally. This simplicity of heart, this noble sincerity leads her to her doom and to her salvation as well. Love that is forgetful of its own deep significance is too selfish to be happy. It does not widen the realm of the spirit, nay it narrows itself down to the bonds of flesh and thus calls down on itself the inexorable curse of flesh. Such was S'akuntalā's love too—it did not lack decorum, it lacked poise; it had enough of fire but less of light. Hence it is that she loses that balance of her nature and the balance of her life. Look at the third act and prelude to the fourth act of the drama. It is the record of a soul cut away from the steady anchorage, tossed about by a stormy passion. It is the account of a love, however powerful, not great, for it is selfish and forgetful of the world, indeed, forgetful of its own sublime mission.

 So the curse of Durbāsā is not a mere accident, it is the nature of her love that calls it down on itself. It is fate's decree, but her character is her own fate, as the poet has amply hinted. Yet it is her character again that will triumph overthe curse. Shadows hover round her, but she is all unconscious of the impending doom. Inspite of the riotous experience of



her heart she remains the simple hermitage girl, her soul still retains the unconscious message that it took in the *'tapovana'*. The fourth act is a vindication of her own character and & vindication of the hermitage which has moulded it. The sage Kaṇva, Gautamī, the two girl mates, the deer, the creeper, all that has formed the back-ground of her life, appear in that great moment in their proper perspective—co-eval and co-equal with her very self. Men and women, animal and plant-lives all seem at this moment of inconceivable separation keenly alive to theloss they are going to sustain. The loss is not of one thing out of a number of things, but of a limb,—probably of the very heart,—of a living organism. The pain of the separation quickens into an overpoweringconsciousness the severed, bleeding limbs of the *tapovana*. And the voiceless cry of her seems to pierce through the grief-laden atmosphere. The fourth act is Kālidāsa's triumph in pure poetry as well as in dramatic technique, the irony of the situation making the pathetic farewell doubly so.

 And the crash comes on the reader not at all suddenly. The opening verse of Haṁsapadikā reminds one of the much too gay character of the king. Virtuous and noble he, nevertheless, confesses to a laxity and inconstancy in love, not uncommon among young princes in those days,—**सकृत्कृत-प्रणयोऽयं जनः**। Here too, we are to note how Durbāsā's curse, as it affects Duṣyanta, springs out of king's own nature. The poet's dramatic insight quickly glimpses the possibilities in the innovation of the curse of the cholerie sage. The projection of what is evil in nature out into the form of a foreign agent, while it preserves nature's law and course, lessens much of its sickening criminality and saves the drama from sinking into absolute squalor. For S'akuntalā the curse is to lead to a spiritual re-awakening in which she is to go forward, for the king Duṣyanta it is to effect a spiritual rebirth in which he should discover higher values of love and life.

 The sixth act brings S'akuntalā's disillusionment. It is the invariable tragic comment on the second and third acts. Curtain could easily have dropped here, if the poet had not to delineate a character like S'akuntalā. Western dramatists have given us heroines with such tragic endings. But Kālidāsa is different,



and her heroine has a different history and different character. She does not drag her heavy steps back to the old *tapovana* to lighten her heart in the groves of *Nava-mallika'* or weep by the streams of *Ma'linī*. The old place would not have been the proper background for this figure shrouded in unutterable grief. It must be full of reminiscences utterly out of tune with the present experience. Away, far away from the tumult of those stored impression in Kaṇva's hermitage, away from its crowd of innumerable associates of former joys and hopes and aspirations, she must fly to the very heart of blank solitude and in a fathomless stillness and silence, nurse her lonely riven heart all alone. The element in her character that has brought her dire and stark disillusionment sustains her through the transcending of her fate. The strong urge of love which led her to first youthful abandon now, sustains the soul in its next deeper strain when it makes for its calm, self-denying, austere career. Her noble origin and destiny she remembers in these times and she discovers that love to be true and never-failing must have its basis on a life of discipline and denial, that love must transcend the bonds of the senses. Her love has always been mighty, she longs to see it great. Only *tapasya'* can make it so, her earthly charms wear away, gaiety is suppressed and is revealed in Act. VII at last invested with the dignity of a mother, calm, pure and holy as a steady flame. Her character is her salvation,—it is the salvation of Duṣyanta too. The libertine is reborn in the world of Love—that of courtly gallantry vanishes like a shadow in light. The seventh act is the story of the soul in travail—till it is born worthy of the vision of a true Love worthy of S'akuntalā. Such is S'akuntalā—a soul's pilgrimage from earthly delights to heavenly bliss, Love's flowing into spiritual joy and *epithalamium* of Earth and Heaven.

**Principal Characters In The Play.**

 **Duṣyanta.—**The hero of the piece is Duṣyanta, a scion of the illustrious line of Puru. Kālidāsa depicts him as an ideal man, an ideal king. In him we have a hero of the **धीरोदात्त** type, and our poet has represented him as gifted with all those noble qualities which go to make such a hero, viz., generosity, self-restraint, fortitude, courage, modesty, amiability, righteousness and graceful bearing.



 Young and handsome, the king is gifted with a physique which commands the admiration of all who come in contact with him. His charioteer finds in him a second Pinākin, his general compares him to a mountain-roaming elephant unaffected by the stress and strain of the chase[^58] and Aditī is full of admiration for his well-built body[^59]. Overflowing with youthful vigour he takes a keen interest in all pastimes which involve severe physical strain and hardship. With all his manly qualities, he is not lacking in those finer accomplishments which make a man charming and agreeable. Of sweet address and graceful bearing, Priyaṁvadā finds in him a delightful companion and a pleasant talker[^60]. He has a culture and refinement worthy of his position and takes a lively interest in such fine arts as music and painting. Natural sights and sounds have always a great fascination for him, and so keen are his powers of observation that even the minutest details cannot escape his notice[^61].

[^58]: "Act II. 4."

[^60]: "Act I."

[^61]: "Act I, 14; VII 8."

 As a man he is an embodiment of all that is noble and divine in human nature. The pre-eminent traits of his character are his nobility of mind, his sense of honour and his wonderful self-control. And these come out prominently in his conduct towards S'akuntalā during their first meeting in the hermitage. Though fascinated by her youthful charms, he struggles hard to keep the unholy desire under control until he has ascertained her parentage and other facts relating to her. He is a dutiful and obedient son, and his tender regard for the feelings of his mother expresses itself in his solicitude when he receives a command from her to return to the capital, just after he has given his word to the hermits to protect them against the oppressions of the demons[^62]. He is an ideal husband and a passionate lover. According to the custom of the times he had a large harem, and though his love towards S'akuntalā was essentially distinct from that shown towards his other wives, he was not unkind and never failed in his duties towards them[^63]. He had great consideration for their feelings and did his best not to hurt them in any way either by deed or word. An incident in the sixth act admirably brings out this trait of the king's character. Writhing in the agonies of remorse after the

[^62]: "Act II. "

[^63]: "87 n, 7."



cessation of Durvasā's curse, the king tries to beguile himself a little by portraying his beloved on the canvas when he is informed of the approach of Queen Vasumatī and he removes the picture in great haste lest the same might offend her.[^64]

 As a king, he has a lofty sense of the duties and responsibilities of that exalted position. The paramount ruler of a vast country, he considers his kingdom as his household and looks after the welfare of his subjects with a fatherly tenderness and care. He is always ready to relieve the distressed and to protect the good against the oppressions of the wicked.He is a mighty monarch who holds the entire earth under his sway by his prowess, and the fact that even Indra, the king of gods, occasionally seeks his help bears testimony to his uncommon military genius. Though commanding respect and obedience from all classes of his subjects. he has the greatest reverence for Brahmins and ascetics. Hs is always anxious to see that their rites and practices are performed without let or hindrance and whenever any interruption or obstruction is apprehended, he is ready to protect them at all costs. So great is his regard for the hermits that at the very mention of the name he withdraws the arrow he was going to put to the bowstring and enters the hermitage in an humble attire and leaves his retinue outside lest he should disturb the tranquillity of the place and cause inconvenience to the inmates of the hermitage[^65].He is a just and upright ruler personally supervising the affairs of the state with a view to ensure the proper administration of justice. His decision with regard to the disposal of the deceased merchant's property testifies to his strong sense of justice[^66]. But nowhere are the strength of his character and his unflinching devotion to virtue brought out into such prominent relief as in his conduct towards S'akuntalā when, accompanied by Gautamī and the disciples of Kaṇva, she appears at the king's court as his wedded wife. Under the influence of Durvāsā's curse the king does not remember his marriage with her and conseqnently refuses to accept her inspite of the assurance given him by S'akuntalā herself and the disciples of Kaṇva. Nothing can make him swerve even an inch from the path of virtue.

 **S'akuntalā.—**In S'akuntalā, the heroine, we have a picture of an ideal woman. And the exquisiteness of the picture is to be found in the fact that S'akuntalā combines in herself physical charm with the beauty of the soul, passion with goodness, and virtue—in short, (in the words of Goethe) she *"combines the young blossoms of the Spring with the ripe fruits of Autumn."* How admirably this combination of Heaven and Earth has been effected will become apparent if we compare the two contrasted pictures of the heroine presented by the poet at the beginning and at the end of the drama.S'akuntalā of the first act is a hermit's daughter, full of youth, beauty and vivacity, "subtle and evasive, throbbing with love, veiled with reserve," with "her two companions running over with playfulness, the newly flowering forest-creeper, the bee intoxicated with perfume and the fascinated king peeping from behind the trees." At the end of the drama she appears as the image of patience and goodness; penitent and sober, invested with the dignity of a mother, clad in a dusty robe, her face pale with austerities and her soul purified by her long penance.

 Born of a nymph-mother and a hermit father, S'akuntalā is possessed of a beauty that is not to be found among mortals[^67], a beauty that is quite natural and has nothing artificial about it. She looks exquisitely charming even in her simple garments. Like "a violet by a mossy stone half-hidden from the eye", she dwells among hermits far away from the artificialities of town-life. Sweet and lovely as a flower, she is quite ignorant of the wiles of the world. Simplicity and purity are deep seated in her nature, and these were the direct outcome of her trustfulness—a virtue which was the cause at once of her downfall and her redemption. It was her trustfulness which allowed her to be carried away by the passion of love without the least suspicion, resulting in her humiliation and disgrace. It was again this trustfulness which sustained her through the most trying period of her life and kept her "constant to patience, forgiveness and loving kindness" and ultimately leads to her reunion with her lover. A daughter of Nature brought up in an atmosphere of freedom, she still presents a picture of feminine modesty and timidity. So great is her modesty that, though consumed by her passionate love for the king, she keeps

[^67]: "Act I, 23."



it concealed from her dearest friends. Her timidity and shyness are revealed in her conduct towards the king when left alone in his company[^68]. The sweetest side of her character is her kind and affectionate nature. Brought up in the hermitage where peace and love reigned supreme, she had learnt to love the entire creation. Her heart is overflowing with the milk of human kindness which extends not merely to the animals in the hermitage, but also to the trees and creepers therein[^69]. She regards them as her kith and kin and is interested in their joys and sorrows. She can not drink water without watering the trees and creepers; she never plucks a tender leaf even to decorate herself, and her joy knows no bounds when the trees first put forth their blossoms[^70]. It is at the time of her departure for her husband's place that her innate affection for every creature in the hermitage fully reveals itself. Though eager to meet her lover, she finds it difficult to tear herself away from the hermitage[^71]. With a heavy heart she bids farewell to the trees and creepers of the hermitage and entrusts them to the care of her friends. She is anxious for the doe that has her confinement near at hand and asks her father to send her information of her safe delivery. When she starts from the hermitage, the motherless fawn whom she brought up with motherly tenderness does not leave her, and with tearful eyes she gently caresses it and persuades it to remain in the hermitage.[^72]

[^68]: "After 106n;"

[^69]: "After 22n;"

[^70]: "Act IV, 9,"

[^71]: "After 135n;"

 A child of Nature, she is "obedient to Nature's impulses like plants and flowers." At the first outburst of passion on the occasion of the king's visit, she could not restrain herself and allows herself to be carried away by it. Her love for the king is so absorbing that her lover became all the world to her and she forgets every thing except the loved one. With all the impetuosity of her passion, her sense of righteousness and femine dignity is remarkable. When Duṣyanta repudiates his marriage with her and accuses her of falsehood, modesty and shyness give place to rage and indignation. She is an embodiment of the Hindu ideal of a woman. Despite her righteous indignation at the king for his disavowal of the marriage and her consequent humiliation, her affection for him

[^72]: "Act IV. 14."



is not in the least diminished, and with a resignation characteristic of a Hindu wife, she blames her destiny, and not the king, for her miseries. The parting advice of her foster-father with regard to the duties of an ideal Hindu wife is firmly rooted in her mind and she tries to realise that ideal in her own life. Abandoned by her husband she leads a life of penance and rigid self-discipline and finally comes out of the trial in all her glory and purity.

 **Kaṇva—**Kaṇva, the foster-father of S'akuntalā presents a perfect picture of a typical ascetic who combines divine vision wlth practical wisdom, rigid self-discipline with a susceptibility to the softer sentiments of the human nature. Underneath the calm and unruffled surface we find a strong under-current of human passion which reveals itself in the parental affection for his adopted daughter. It was an accident that he found S'akuntalā deserted by her parents and it was out of pity that he carried the helpless infant to his hermitage. Though he is thus only the foster father of S'akuntalā, his affection for her is genuine and real. He brings her up like his own daughter and is anxious to give her away in marriage to a husband worthy of her. It was out of his solicitude for her welfare that he was away from the hermitage on a pilgrimage to the sacred waters to pacify her evil stars at the time when the king visited the hermitage. On his return he learns with satisfaction the fact of S'akuntalā's marriage with the king and like a true father immediately arranges to send her to her husband's place. But nowhere is the intensity of his affection better revealed than at the time of S'akuntalā's departure from the hermitage. With all his asceticism and self-control he finds it very difficult to part with S'akuntalā. The very thought of separation perturbs his mind, his heart is smitten with anguish. But his asceticism and self-control soon restore the equilibrium and throughout the rest of the pathetic scene we find him calm and collected and not overwhelmed with grief like any ordinary parent. Though leading the life of an ascetic far away from the turmoil of the world, he is not ignorant of the affairs of the world and has a clear grasp of the duties and responsibilities of a non-ascetic life[^73]. His parting advice to S'akuntalā and his message to the king are wonderful specimens of worldly wisdom

[^73]: "After 144n."



and perfect knowledge of menand things. His advice to S'akuntalā is really *"an excellent compendium of every wife's duties"* and portrays in an elegant and forceful language the Hindu ideal of womanhood. The message he delivers to the king through his disciples is another instance of his remarkable power. The whole message is couched in a language which is remarkable for its restrained and dignified tonewith due deference to the king as the lord of the earth.We have a last glimpse of the sage after the departure of S'akuntalā when consoling the weeping companions of S'akuntalā he enters the hermitage with a heavy heart, though not without an inward feeling of relief at the thought of having sent S'akuntalā to her husband[^74].

[^74]: "IV, 22."

**S'ārṇgarava and S'āradvata**

 S'ārṅgarava and S'āradvata are two of Kaṇva's disciples, and the fact that they are selected for the momentous task of escorting S'akuntalá to her husband's place shows that they occupied a position of pre eminence among the disciples[^75]. Of the two again, S'árṅgarava seems to be the older and maturer in wisdom, because it is he who is placed at the head of the party and it is to him that Kaṇva delivers the message for the king. The two disciples, however, differ widely in their disposition and temperament. S'ārṅgarava is haughty, conceited easily excitable and impatient of contradiction, while S'āradvata is sober, considerate and self-possessed. The former regards the ascetic life as the best and looks down upon other orders of life, while the latter, though realising the supremacy of the ascetic life, is full of consideration and sympathy for the life of the ordinary people. The sight of the king's court creates different impressions in the minds of the two. S'ārṅgarava compares the place to a house which is in flames and should immediately be shunned, while S'āradvata pities the condition of the people there whom he regards as asleep and in fetters[^76].When the king fails to remember his marriage with S'akuntalá and is in a state of hesitation, S'árṅgarava grows impatient and considers the king's silence as an indication of the perversity born of power[^77]. Again, when the king disbelieves the story of his marriage even

[^75]: "VI, 9."

[^76]: " V, II."

[^77]: "V, 18."



after the assurance given by the ascetics and S'akuntalā herself and expresses his inability to accept her as his wedded wife, his self-control gives way to indignation and wrath and he charges the king with meanness and insincerity[^78]. S'áradvata's self-possession and practical wisdom save the situation all throughout. It is S'āradvata who suggests that S'akuntalā should speak for herself in order to convince the king of the marriage[^79]. After the king's repudiation of the marriage, when S'ārṅgarava indulges in a vehement expression of his wrath by uttering imprecation on the king for his meanness and insincerity and by rebuking S'akuntalā for her thoughtlessness, S'āradvata with his characteristic coolness, asks S'ārṅgarava to put a stop to that altercation and asks the party to depart leaving S'akuntalā whom the king as her husband and lord could accept or reject just as he liked.[^80]

[^78]: "V, 20,"

[^79]: " After V, 20,"

**Anasūyā and Priyaṁvadā**

[^80]: " V, 26; "

 Anasūyā and Priyaṁvadā, the two companions of S'akuntalā are *"the best types of sincere sisterly affection."* They are of the same age as S'akuntalā, and their beauty is not much inferior to hers[^81]. What endears them most to us is their disinterested and sincere attachment to S'akuntalā who is to them all in all, the centre of all their thoughts and anxieties. The sole aim of their existence seems to be nothing other than ministering to the happiness of their friend in every possible way. They help her in watering the plants and in looking after the trees and creepers of the hermitage entrusted to her care by her foster-father. Their anxiety at the state of her health when she is smitten with love which, out of modesty, she conceals from her friends, their importunate entreaties to her to reveal to them the cause of her affliction, their ingenious contrivance of the secret interview between their friend and her lover, themselves keeping guard over the meeting while the two lovers are engaged in delightful conversation—all these go to show their genuine affection for S'akuntalā. When they overhear the curse of Durvasā upon their friend who was oblivious of everything else in her overpowering passion for the king, their anxiety knows no

[^81]: "After 34n; 207n 3."



bounds and they do their level best to appease the sage and ward off the curse. Though they are eager to see their friend united with her lover, yet it is with great sorrow that they part with her and return to the hermitage which bereft of S'akuntalā, has now lost all its charms for them.

 The two friends, however,form a contrasted pair. Priyaṁvadá is more vivacious, gay, saucy and quickwitted, while Anasūyā is more thoughtful and grave. Priyaṁvadā is characterised by strong feeling and is prone to act on the impulse of the moment without bothering muchabout the future; while Anasūyā is characterised by maturer understanding and is very considerate and cautious and thinks more of the future than the present. The mutual attraction between S'akuntalā and Duṣyanta ishailed with great joy by Priyaṁvadā who tries to bring about a speedy union between the lovers to complete the happiness of their friend, while Anasūyā cares more for the future consequences of the union than the immediate happiness of S'akuntalā and tries to ascertain by clever talks with the king, the possibility of happiness resulting out of the union.When they overhear the curse of Durvāsā, both are, no doubt, greatly shocked; but while Priyaṁvadā is bewildered and at a loss to ascertain what to do, Anasūyā soon recovers self-possession and tries to think out the means of warding off the curse.

Thus the clause means "which is the first creation of the creator" i.e., water, and in support of this explanation ‘अप एव ससर्ज आदौ’(MS. I. 8) has been invariably quoted. But this explanation has to be taken with a grain of salt, for nowhere in the scriptures *water is* *said to be the first creation* and any thing contradictory to the Vedas is invalid. Now आदौ of Manu means "before the creation of the golden egg (ब्रह्माण्ड) in which was born हिरण्यगर्भ ब्रह्मा, and not before the very beginning. Cf. "अपां सृष्टिश्चेयं महदहंकारतन्मात्रक्रमेण बोद्धव्या"—KB. Later on in S'lokas 75-79, Manu clearly states that of the five elements *water* was created after *Fire*, the order being आकाश\>वायु\>अग्नि\>अप्\>पृथिवी. This genesis of the creation is in consonance with that of the Śruti which states—तस्माद्वाएतस्मादात्मनःआकाशः सम्भूतः। आकाशाद्वायुः। वायोरग्निः। अग्नेराप्। अद्भ्यः पृथिवी—Taittirīya Upaniṣat. Apparent anomalies like 'तस्य अर्चतः आपोऽजायन्त'—Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣat; “ततः समुद्रः अर्णवः”—ṚV ; “आपो इदमग्ने सलिलमेवास”—Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa XI. I. 6. I; 'आपो वा इदमग्रे सलिलमासीत्'—TaittirīyaBrāhmaṇa, have been reconciled by S'rīŚaṅkarācárya thus:—'तस्य अर्चतः आपः रसात्मिका अजायन्त। तत्र, आकाशप्रभृतीनाम् त्रयाणाम् उत्पत्त्यनन्तरमिति वक्तव्यम्।' It is very difficult to believe that a versatile poet like Kálidása was unaware of the statements of the Śruti. So we propose to explain स्रष्टुःas referring to हिरण्यगर्भ ब्रह्मा and आद्या as *anterior*, or *immediately* *preceding*.’ Vide "एकादशद्यः—immmediately before the eleventh i. e., the tenth"—*M.'s* *Sanskrit-English Dictionary P. 137;* "So संयुक्ताद्यः"—*AD.* Káli, has already used आद्य in this sense. Cf.

If our explanation is accepted the whole will mean—(The form) i. e., water which was (*immediately*) anterior to the birth of स्रष्टा i. e., हिरण्यगर्भ ब्रह्मा (who in the shape of a golden egg was born in water—MS. I. 10). Here is विरोधाभास अलंकार (*apparent contradiction*), for how can water a created thing exist before the creator, but the solution is that the water is the creation of ब्रह्म (क्लीं, एकमेवाद्वितीयम्) and not of ब्रह्मा (पुं, प्रजापति)। 'विरोधश्चाऽविरोधोऽपि विरुद्धत्वेन यद्वचः'—KPr.

 **2**. **वहति** &c. —refers to fire, the carrier of oblations to the gods.

During the performance of the sacrificial rites a sacrificer is regarded as a portion of S'iva. Cf.—'यथा च वृत्तान्तमिमंसदोगतस्त्रिलोचनैकांशतया दुरासदः। तवैव सन्देशहराट् विशाम्पतिः शृणोतिलोकेश तथा विधीयताम्'॥—Ra. III. 66. **5**. **ये द्वे कालं** &c.—The Moon has nothing to do in regulating the time (अहोरात्रंविभजते सूर्यो मानुषदैविके'—MS. 1. 65), still Kálidása here follows the popular notion accord—



ing to which the sun regulates the day, while the moon regulates the night. **6**. **श्रुतिविषयगुणा**—refers to आकाश which has only one property viz. sound. Excepting this and 'अथात्मनः शब्दगुणंगुणज्ञः'—Ra. XIII. I, there is no reference to the Nyáya Philosophy in Kálidása's work. Prof. Apte is of opinion that the poet might have borrowed the idea from the Sāṅkhya Philosophy. Hence Kālidāsa might have lived before the development of the Nyāya Philosophy. Cf. 'वाप्य स्थितम् रोदसी'—Vik. I.; 'श्रुति-विषयगुणा इत्यनेन आकाशार्थ-प्रतीतौ विलम्बात्। क्लिष्टत्वदोषः। स च “प्रथित-रव-गुणा” इति पाठेन समाधेयः—HS. **7**. **आहुः**—ब्रु+उस् (लट्अन्ति)—cf.

Vedántins, however, hold that as शब्द is प्रत्यक्ष to the श्रुति's, so आकाश may be considered as प्रत्यक्ष। नव्यनैयायिकऽ consider वायु as प्रत्यक्ष *cf*.तस्मात् प्रभां पश्यामीतिवत् वायुं–स्पृशामीति प्रत्ययसंभवात् वायोरपि प्रत्यक्षत्वंसंभवत्येव—Muktāvali. **10**. **प्रपन्नः**—is better than प्रसन्नः(*pleased*) in which case, also when प्रपन्न is explained as युक्त (*R*), the epithet प्रत्यक्षाभिःhas no force. प्रपन्नः means अन्वितः, प्राप्तः, but in most cases शरणागतः, *Cf.* 'शाधि मां त्वां प्रपन्नम्'—GītāII. 7.

“रङ्गविघ्नोपशान्तये नान्दीमादौ प्रयोजयेत्”। Nāndī may have 4, 8, 10, 12, 16, 18 or 22 **पद**Saccording as पद is explained to mean a grammatical word, foot of a verse or a complete clause within a bigger complex or compound sentence—Vide नाट्यप्रदीप, नाट्यशास्त्र (5.109) and अभिनवभारती (Baroda. Ed. P. 25-26). Ḍhunḍirája's com. on MD, Bhávaprakáśana of Sáradátanaya ch. VII. P. 196-197. नान्दी is of four kinds:—“नमस्कृतिर्माङ्गलिकीआशीःपत्रावली तथा। नान्दी चतुर्धा निर्दिष्टा नाटकादिषु धीमता”॥ Here नान्दी is of the **पत्रावला** type, since the plot is slightly hinted at. Apropos of the expression 'नाद्यन्तेसूत्रधारः'।Jagaddhara in VS. remarks:—"नाद्यन्ते सूत्रधारः। ननु इदम् असङ्गतम्। नहि नान्दी–पाठानन्तरम् सूत्रधारः रङ्गभूमिं प्रविशति। किन्तु प्रविश्य पठति। न च अन्येनैव नान्दी पठनीया। सूत्रधारपठनीयत्वेन तस्य उक्तत्वात्। 'सूत्रधारः पठेत् एनां मध्यमं स्वरमाश्रितः'—इति वचनात्। उच्यते। नान्दी तावत् रङ्गप्रवेशानन्तरम् सूत्रधारेणैव पठनीया, नान्द्यन्ते सूत्रधार इति सूत्रधारसाम्यात् स्थापके प्रयोगः। तदुक्तंतत्रैव। "नान्दींप्रयुज्य निष्क्रामेत् सूत्रधारः सहानुगः। स्थापकः प्रविशेत् पश्चात् सूत्रधार-गुणाकृतिः॥ पूर्व्वरङ्गं विधायादो सूत्रधारे विनिर्गते। प्रविश्य तद्वदपरः काव्यमास्थापयेन्नटः"॥ इति। अतएव कुत्रचित् पुस्तके “नान्द्यन्ते स्थापकः” इत्येव पाठः![](../books_images/U-IMG-1736683187Capture2.PNG)![](../books_images/U-IMG-1736683187Capture2.PNG) अन्ये तु नान्द्यवसाने सूत्रधारः प्रविशति वदति वा। तदन्ते सूत्रधारस्यैव श्रुतत्वात् सापि तेनेव पठनीया। प्रथमं च सूत्रधारो न उक्तः। मङ्गलार्थं देवता-नमस्कारादेः एव विधानात् इत्यूचुः। The gist is as follows:—Here the stage-direction should have been नान्द्यन्ते सूत्रधारः वदति, or प्रविश्य पठति ; otherwise the sentence remains incomplete. But then two questions would naturally arise:—who recites the नान्दी and when does the सूत्रधार enter the stage ? The only positive answer is this, that the सूत्रधार, in the very beginning of the play, enters the stage and himself recites the नान्दी। No other person is expected to recite it as that will go against the injunction of Bharata. But even then another question arises:—



why does the stage-direction follow नान्दी and not precede it ? Itis like putting the cart before the horse. The only explanation isthat the stage direction सूत्रधारः प्रविशति etc. is not used at the very outset, because nothing but *auspicious* words should begin a work. As for instance, Pāṇini begins his अष्टाध्यायी with 'वृद्धिरादैच्,' putting वृद्धि as *indicative* *of prosperity* in the beginning, though properly speaking it should have been 'आदैच्वृद्धिः' like 'अदेङ् गुणः'। In (S), how ever, as in Bhása's works, this expression occurs just at the beginning of the benedictory verse. **2**. **सूत्रधारः—**Literally it means the holder of the thread, hence the manager who develops the thread of the plot. He is in charge of directing the stage business and takes a leading part in the prologue (प्रस्ताबना)।Originally, some scholars opine, the term might have been applied to the wirepuller in a puppet show, and the drama developed out of such exhibition.—MR. IV. 3. If he be a non-Brahmin, he is called Sthāpaka. **3**. **नेपथ्याभिमुखं**—etc.—निनो नेत्रस्य, ने नेतुर्वा पथ्यम्। संज्ञापूर्वकत्वात् न ह्रस्वः—BhD.; suitable to the eye or men; 'नेपथ्यंस्यात् जवनिका रङ्गभूमिः प्रसाधनम्' इत्यजयः। Here it means 'the Green-room', also 'dressing or painting'. **4**. **अवसितम्** etc.—please come this way if you have finished your *dressing or painting*; or if all the different actors are ready after having *finished their toilet*. अव+सो+क्त कर्मणि=अवसितम्, सो=सि by'द्यति-स्यति-मा-स्थाम् इत्, ति किति' 7. 4. 40.

This is perhaps also the view of Katyāyana, as will be inferred from the use of the plural number in आख्यायिकाभ्यः। This view is endorsed by Goyicandra and Tarkavácaspati 'आख्यायिका गद्यपद्यप्रबन्धे' इति तर्कवाचस्पतिः शब्दचिन्तामणिश्च। **6**. **नामधेयेन**—नाम एव नामधेयम्। स्वार्थे धेयः। 'भागरूप-नामभ्यो धेयः' Vart. 5. 4. 26. नामकार्यं नाटकस्य गर्भितार्थ-प्रकाशकम्—SD. **7**.**नाटकेन**—नाटयति इति नट चुरादि+ण्वुल् कर्तरि = नाटकम् (3. 1. 133; 7.1.1.).

For adj. use of बलवत् vide 89n. 3. **7**. **अप्रत्ययं चेतः**—Here is the fault named 'अविमृष्टविधेयांशत्व' Cf. "विधेयस्यांशस्य विमर्शाऽभावेन गुणीभूतत्वम् अविमृष्ट-विधेयांशत्वम्"—SD. VII. i.e. If the predicate is not mentioned at all or a subordinate or wrong position is assigned to it, we have the above-mentioned fault. Hence if 'अप्रत्ययम्' is substituted by 'न प्रत्येति' then there arises



no doubt as to the true nature of अप्रत्ययम् *i. e.* whether it is a part of the predicate or an attribute to the subject. For similar idea cf. 'प्रायः प्रत्ययमाधत्ते स्वगुणेषूत्तमादरः'—Ku. VI. 20. The figure is पर्यायोक्त as the fact to be intimated i. e., manager's apprehension about the success of the play is expressed in a round-about way. According to HS there is अर्थापत्ति as well as अर्थान्तरन्यास।

 **7n.—1. आर्यमिश्रैः**—'वाच्यौ नटीसूत्रधारौ आर्यनाम्ना परस्परम्'—SD. 6. मिश्र is a title of respect (Com.) belonging to मतल्लिकादि class. “मतल्लिको्-घमिश्राः स्युः प्रकाण्ड-स्थल-भित्तयः। हस्त-पाश-तटाः पाद-पाली-मचर्चिकादयः”—GM. पूर्वनिपात by 'प्रशंसावचनैश्च, 2. 1. 66. Or, say आर्याणां मिश्राः प्रधानाः श्रेष्ठाः, तैः। 'प्रधाने मिलिते मिश्रः'—धरणिः। **2**. **अनुबोधित** &c.—For बुध read 'बोधते धर्मविद्यां यः क्षत्रविद्यां च बोधति। नित्यम् अध्यात्म-युक्तात्मा ब्रह्मविद्यां च बुध्यते'—KR. **'अस्मि'** here and in the following verse, can be taken as an अव्यय in the sense of 'अहम्'। *Cf*. 'एवम् “त्वाम् अस्मि वच्मि” इत्यत्र अस्मि इत्यहमर्थे तिङन्त-प्रतिरूपकम् (अव्ययम)'—JS. MN's discussion under 'आ संसृतेरस्मि जगत्सु जातः'—Ki. III. 6.; 'अन्यत्र कुसुमावचायं कुरुध्वमत्रास्मि करोमि सख्यः'—KPr. III. 20. **3**. **अस्मिन् क्षणे विस्मृतम्** &c.—This is an explanation for the use of 'प्रकरण' instead of नाटक in 'इदानीं कतमत् प्रकरणम्' &c. प्रगता सभा विचारः अस्मादिति **प्रसभं**—Perforce.—Gitā. II. 60. **4**. **एष राजेव दुष्यन्तः** &c.—राज दीप्तौ+कनिन् = राजा (ऊ—162) ; वेण, father of पृथु, was a notorious king and slain like Charles I by



his subjects. His son was the first man to get the epithet राजा, on account of his pleasing his subjects. *Cf*. 'पृथु' वैणं प्रजा दृष्ट्वा “रक्ताःस्मेति” यदब्रुवन्। ततो राजेति नामाऽस्यानुरागादजायत।' Also, पित्राऽपरञ्जितास्तस्य प्रजास्तेनाऽनुरञ्जिताः। अनुरागात् ततस्तस्य नाम राजेत्यभाषत।'—VP. I. Ch. 13. **5**. **सारङ्गेण**—'शारङ्गः चातके ख्यातः शवले हरिणेऽपिच' इति अजयः। 'अतएव सारङ्गः दन्त्यादिस्तालव्यादिश्च' इति भरतः। Káli. generally uses this word in the sense of deer. Very rarely, it means चातक। *Cf*.:—'प्रवृद्ध इव पर्जन्यः सारङ्गैरभिनन्दितः'—Ra. XVII. 15. **6**. **प्रस्तावना**—VK quotes this very S'loka as an instance of प्रस्तावना of **अवलगित** variety, (*SD. V1*); but R calls it **प्रयोगातिशय** for the plot of the play is opened by hinting the approach of the hero..पात्रप्रवेशो यत्रैष प्रयोगातिशयो मतः—DR. III. 10.

 **Remark**—The forgetfulness on the part of the Manager is very significant. It is the keynote of the Drama. Not only the manager forgets the name of the Drama to be staged, but S'akuntalā, the guest-in-charge, also forgets to receive the sage Durbāsā, and as a result was thrown into the abyss of oblivion and consequently Duṣyanta also forgot clean of S'akuntalā.

**प्रथमोऽङ्कः**

(ततः प्रविशति मृगानुसारी सशरचापहस्तो राजा रथेन सूतश्च)।

 (Then enter in a chariot, chasing a deer, the king with a bow and arrow in hand and the charioteer).

 **सूतः**—(राजानम् मृगञ्चावलोक्य)—**आयुष्मन्**—

कृष्णसारे ददच्चक्षुस्त्वयि चाधिज्यकार्मुके।  
मृगानुसारिणं साक्षात् पश्यामीव पिनाकिनम्॥६॥

(श्लोकः)

 Charioteer—(*Looking at the king and the stag*). O Long-lived Sir, flinging my gaze on the stag and on you with your bow strung, I see, as it were, the Pināka-holder (*S'iva*) pursuing the deer in a visible form.

 **तत इति**—ततः प्रस्तावनायाः अन्ते 'सशर-चाप-हस्तो' धृतधनुर्बाणः 'सूतश्च' सारथिश्च ('सूतश्च सारथौ तक्ष्णि, क्षत्रियाद् ब्राह्मणीसुते' इति विश्वमेदिन्यौ) 'रथेन' सहार्थे ३या \['विनापि तद्योगं तृतीया। “वृद्धो युना तल्लक्षणश्चेदेव विशेषः,” १।२।६५ इति निर्देशात् इति भट्टोजिः।\] \[अत्र “ततः प्रविशति” इत्यारभ्य द्वितीयाङ्के “उभौ परिक्रम्योपविष्टौ” इत्यन्तेन सार्धाङ्केन मुखसंधिः। तल्लक्षणं तु दर्पणे “यत्र बीज-समुत्पत्तिर्नानार्थ-रस-सम्भवा। प्रारम्भेण समायुक्ता तन्मुखं परिकीर्तितम्”॥ आरम्भ-बीजयोर्लक्षणे पुनः तत्रैव—“भवेदारम्भ औत्सुक्यं यन्मुख्यफलसिद्धये” इति। यथात्र “राजा—भवतु। तामेव पश्यामि”॥ “अल्पमात्रं समुद्दिष्टं बहुधा यद्विसर्पति। फलस्य प्रथमो हेतुर्बीजं तदभिधीयते॥” यथात्र “पुत्रमेवं-गुणोपेतं चक्रवर्तिनमाप्नुहि” इति। यथा च “वैखानसः—इदानीमेव दुहितरं शकुन्तलाम् अतिथिसत्काराय नियुज्य” इति॥\] **सूत इति**—सूतस्य संस्कृतं पाठ्यं \[“पुरुषाणामनौचानां संस्कृतं स्यात् कृतात्मनाम्” इति दर्पणः ; अतः “आयुष्मन् इति वाच्यस्तु रथी सूतेन सर्वदा” इति भरतोक्तेः १७।७४ 'आयुष्मन्' इति

 **8n.—1. अङ्कः**—'अन्तर्निष्क्रान्त-निखिलपात्रोऽङ्क इति कीर्तितः'—SD. VI. In a Sanskrit drama an act means that period at the end of which ‘all the *Dramatis Personœ* leave the stage.' **2**. **सूत**—सुवति गमयति अश्वान् इति सू+क्त—BhD. 'क्षत्रियात् विप्रकन्यायां सूतं भवति जातितः'—MS. X. 2. The Sūtas (सारथि) though they follow the profession of a charioteer (*Cf*. 'सूतानाम् अश्वसारथ्यम्'—MS. X. 47) are endowed with multifarious qualifications. *Cf*. “निमित्त-शकुन-ज्ञानी हयशिक्षाविशारदः। हयाऽऽयुर्वेदतत्त्वज्ञः भूरिभागविशेषवित्॥ स्वामिभक्तो महोत्साहः सर्वेषाञ्च प्रियंवदः। शूरश्च कृतविद्यश्च सारथिः परिकीर्तितः”—MP. Ch. 189. In old times सारथि's were highly respected. The charioteer *Sumantra* was the 8th minister of Daśaratha “सुमन्त्रश्चाष्टमोऽर्थवित्”. Lord Kṛṣṇa and king Śalya played the part of a charioteer in Kurukṣetra war. **3**. **आयुष्मन्**—The charioteer is to address the रथी as आयुष्मन् (*Com.*). **4**. **कृष्णसारे**



—सार (*variegated*) includes black colour (कृष्ण) also, hence tautology. \[*Cf.* सद्रत्र-मुक्ता-फल-वज्रभाञ्जि—Bk. 1. 7. where रत्र includes मुक्ता (*pearl*) and वज्र (*diamond*).\] To avoid difficulty say शबलत्वेऽपि कृष्णवर्णस्य आधिक्यद्योतनार्थं 'कृष्ण' इत्यस्य पृथग्निर्देशः। **5**. **मृगानुसारिणं**—Refers to the Horse-sacrifice of Dakṣa, where all gods but S'iva were invited. In course of the sacrifice, words of insult were uttered against S'iva in the presence of Satī, wife of S'iva. Mortified at this Satī renounced her body on the spot. Then came S'iva, highly indignant, killed Dakṣa, drove away the guests and pursued the 'Yajña' that fled through the air in the guise of a fleet gazelle. The Mahā. (सौप्तिक १८) gives a different story. It was the gods that instituted the sacrifice where no portion of the offering was offered to S'iva and this was the cause of his ire. *Cf*. The idea with 'विद्रुत-क्रतु-मृगानुसारिणं येन बाणमसृजद् वृषभध्वजः'—Ra. XI. 44; Rat. I. III. Also VaP. Ch. 30. 156-157, where वीरभद्र by the order of S'iva pursued the deer.

 राजा—सूत, दूरममुना सारङ्गेण वयमाकृष्टाः। अयं पुनरिदानीमपि—

 तदेषः कथमनुपतत एव मे प्रयत्न-प्रेक्षणीयः संवृत्तः ?

 King—Charioteer, we have been brought far by this dappled hart. Even now—flinging glances, ever and anon, on the chasing



car gracefully by bending the neck, having with the major portion of his hind-half, entered his foreframe dreading the descent of the arrow, having his path strewn with half-chewed Darva grass falling from his mouth agape through exhaustion—behold, how he, by reason of his lofty bounds, is treading mostly in the air and very little on the earth. How is it that he has become hardly visible, though I am pursuing him (*closely*) ?

 **9n.—1. अयम् पुनः** etc.—'अयम्' is expected to take २या, being the object of 'पश्य' ; while as a nominative of 'धावति' it is to take १मा। To avoid difficulty parse 'पश्य' as an अव्यय (*Com.*) Or justify the use of प्रथमा विभक्ति by the dictum “अपादान-सम्प्रदान करणाऽऽधारकर्मणाम्। कर्तुश्चान्योऽन्य-सन्देहे परमेकं प्रवर्तते॥” Strictly speaking this कारिका is not necessary, as the arrangement of as in Pāṇini's grammar is sufficient for the removal of all doubts. Pāṇini's order is as follows:—'ध्रुवम् अपाये अपादानम्' १।४।२४ 'कर्म्मणा यमभिप्रैति स सम्प्रदानम्' १।४।३२ ‘साधकतमं करणम्’ १।४।४४ ‘आधारोऽधिकरणम्’ १।४।४६ 'कर्तुरीप्सिततमं कर्म' १।४।४९ 'स्वतन्त्रः कर्ता' १।४।५४। Now apply the dictum 'विप्रतिषेधे परं कार्यम्' १।४।२, which will give the same result. In fact the whole sentence 'अयं वियति...प्रयाति is the object of पश्य। 'पश्य मृगो धावति' इत्यादौ तु मृगकर्तृकं गमनं दृशि-क्रियायाः कर्म, प्रधानं दृशि क्रियैव—Prabhā. **पुनः** implies भेद, difference; 'पुनरप्रथमे मतम्। अधिकारे च भेदे तथा पक्षान्तरेऽपि च' इति मेदिनी। Though he has been running for a long time, there is no difference in his speed. **2**. **स्यन्दने**—स्यन्दन lit. means that which runs fast hence a chariot.Mark the propriety of the word. **3**. **दत्तदृष्टिः**—Found in old Mss. is better than 'बद्धदृष्टिः' (Ra. 1-40) which requires that the gaze of the stag is to be fixed on the car, which is highly improbable with his running in full speed for life. Besides **मुहुः** goes against it. The competitors in any athletic sports for hundred yards race will corroborate our



remarks. **4**. **पश्चार्धेन**—'धान्येन धनवान्' इतिवत् अभेदे करणे ३या, for it is the पश्चार्ध which was considerably drawn by the antelope (*to avoid the descent of arrows*), but our poet identifies the antelope with thehind part. **5**. **शरपतन-भयात्**—'विभाषागुणेऽस्त्रियाम्' 2. 3. 25 इति हेतौ पञ्चमी। The hinder part of the body is specially drawn in, for it is the hinder part that will be wounded when the arrow is hurled from behind. **6**. **पूर्वकायम्**—चीयते अन्नादिभिः इति चि+घञ् करणे = कायः (च = क) (निवासचिति—३।३।४१) पूर्व implies a certain part (अवयव) of the body, hence एकदेशी समासः (पूर्वं कायस्य) by 'पूर्वाऽपर—' 2.2.1. and this bars षष्ठीतत्। **7**. **दर्भैः कीर्णवर्त्मा**—An instance of सापेक्षत्वेऽपि गमकत्वात् समासः। Read “प्रतियोगिपदात्न्यद् यदन्यत् कारकादपि। वृत्तिशब्दैकदेशस्य सम्बन्धस्तेन नेष्यते॥ तरुण्यो वृषलीभार्यः, प्रवीरं पुत्रकाम्यति। ऋद्धस्व राजमातङ्गा इति न स्युः प्रयुक्तयः॥ चैत्रस्य दासभार्येयं, लुनचक्रो रथो मया। शरैः शातितपत्रोऽयं वृक्षादिति सतां मतम्॥'—*Hari*. The gist is that no एकादेशान्वय (i. e. गमकत्व) is valid unless the relation between the separated word (दर्भैः) andone of the compounded words (कीर्ण) is either of प्रतियोगिपद (i. e. शेषे षष्ठी), or one of *Ka'raka*. Here the relation being one of Kāraka (i. e. करण), गमकत्व is justified. Vide Ra. I. 15; XIII. 25 ; XIV. 25; II. 27; Bk. I. 11; Rat. I. 7, 228n. 1. **8**. **अवलीढ़ेः**—अव+लिह्+क्त कर्मणि अवलीढ़ाः eaten; 'होढ़ः' 8. 2. 31. इति हस्य ढत्वम्। **9**. O**प्लुतत्वाद्** &c.—प्लु means to swim, so owing to continuous boundings of the stag, its feet hardly touched the ground, so it appeared that they were swimming through the air. उदग्र—Vide Ra. II. 53 ; IV. 22 ; VI. 32.

 **Remarks.**—This stanza is quoted by KPr as an instance of भयानक रस। There are दुःश्रवत्वदोष owing to उर्व्याम्, and वाच्यानभिधानदोष



as (समुच्चयार्थक च) has not been used after उर्व्याम्। “याति भूमौ च किञ्चित्”—इति पाठे तयोः समाधानम्—HS.

** सूतः—आयुष्मन्, उद्घातिनो भूमिरिति मया रश्मिसंयमनाद्रथस्य मन्दीकृतो वेगः। तेन मृग एष विप्रकृष्टान्तरः। सम्प्रति सम-देश-वर्तिनस्ते न दुरासदो भविष्यति।**

 Charioteer—O Long-lived Sir, the ground being undulatory I have lessened the speed of the car, by tightening the reins. Hence the distance of the deer (*from us*) has become very great. Now that you are on even ground it will not be difficult to overtake him.

 **V. L.**—'उद्घातिनी'—R. V. B. 'उत्खातिनी'—M. S. R has 'संवृत्तः' after विप्रकृष्टान्तरः। 'समदेशवर्तिनस्ते'—R. V. M. S. 'समदेशवर्ती न ते'—B.

 राजा—तेन हि मुच्यन्ताम-भीषवः।

 King—Then do slacken the reins.

ङीप् ; 3. 2. 75. **मन्दीकृतः**—च्वि actually comes when the change is real. Vide 3.1.76. **2**. **सम-देश-वर्तिनस्ते**—Is to be preferredas the reading of (B) gives the stag scope enough for occupying the even ground which but increases the distance, while with the former reading the king gets the advantage.

Charioteer—As the long-lived Sir commands.(*Gesticulating speed of the car.*) Behold, long-lived Sir, behold. The reins being loosened, the horses with their fore-frames fully outstretched, with their yak-tail crests (*on their heads*) motionless, and their ears erect and still, and not outfled even by the dust raised by themselves, are galloping, as if jealous of the speed of the antelope.

Max Muller derives it from घृ *to shine*, (*Cf*. घृणि, घृत) which, he says, has been replaced by हृ in classical sanskrit. Sāyana explains 'हरित' as सूर्यरश्मयः which are considered as the seven horses of the Sun (RV. 150, 8, 115, 4). Hence the sun is called हरिदश्च (AK.) **2**. **हरीन्**—The horses of Indra. Vide Dr. Wilson's ṚV. P. 7. note. (1. 16. 1 ; 101, 10 ; 52, 8.) and hence Indra is called हरिहय (जम्भभेदौ हरिहयः स्वाराण् नमुचिसूदनः—AK), also हरिवाहन in Vik. III ; R explains हरित् as green ('पालाशोहरितोहरित्'—AK) and explains 'च' in the sense of अपि—'चोऽप्यर्थे। वेगेन सूर्याश्चा अपि एभिर्जिता। अन्येषां का गणना इत्यपिशब्दार्थः। **3**. **तथाहि**—(Ra. I. 29) This brings forth reasons for the justification of the exaggeration in सत्यम्। तथा (गतौ) + लोट् हि = तथाहि (Com.). **4**. **सहसा**—(Ra. XII. 11).goes with 2nd and 3rd lines also; all on a sudden, hence it is suggestive of great speed. **5**. **अद्धा**—तत्त्वतः, 'तत्त्वेतु अद्धाऽञ्जसा द्वयम्'—AK.—which is really disconnected; अन्तः means मध्ये—which is disconnected in the middle. The former seems to be preferable. **6**. **कृतसन्धानम्**—सहसा इति भावः। सम्–धा + ल्युट् भावे = सन्धानम्—Joining together. *Ra.

 Hermit—Oh king, we are out in quest of faggots; yonder, on the banks of the Mālinī is seen the hermitage of Kāśyapa the patriarchal sage (*lit. the teacher and supporter of ten thousand disciples.*) If other duties are not transgressed, deign to enter (*it*) and accept the hospitality due to guests.

 Hermit—Having recently directed his daughter Śakuntalā to entertain guests, he has gone to Somatīrtha, with a view to appeasing her froward destiny.

 **राजा—भवतु, तामेव पश्यामि। सा खलु विदितभक्तिं मां महर्षेः कथयिष्यति।**

 **17n.—1. दुहितरं**—Śak, was given the charge of receiving the guests, inspite of the presence of so many learned disciples. This shows that she was the all in all of the sage's life. Besides merits that will accrue from the reception of guests may avert her adverse destiny. (*See next*). **नियुज्य**—युज takes locative of the object or purpose assigned. Cf. आश्रमधर्मे नियुङ्क्ते, धर्माधिकारे नियुक्तः, आलवालपूरणे नियुक्ता—Infra ; Ra. V. 29, MM. 1. 9. **2**. **दैवमस्याः प्रतिकूलं** &c.—suggests that Śak. though forsaken by the king, will be reunited with him. शम+णिच् gives शमयति and शामयति, but with (उपसर्ग), only (प्र)शमयति—60n. 2 दैव means actions performed in previous birth. “पूर्वजन्मकृतं कर्म तद्दैवम् इति कथ्यते”—Y. The reaction of दैव can both be diminished or increased. Cf. 'दैवं वर्धयितुं शक्यं क्षयं कर्तुं सलीलया'—BrP.

IX. 6. **3**. **सोमतीर्थं** or प्रभासतीर्थम् (*Com.*)—is a place of pilgrimage in Kathiwar in western India, near the temple of Somanātha, Here Soma was cured of consumption inflicted on him by the imprecation of Dakṣa. 'यत्र तप्तं तपस्तेन सोमेन सुमहात्मना। पञ्चवर्षसहस्राणि एकपादेन तिष्ठति॥—BP. Our poet shows his foresightedness by keeping Kaṇva out of the hermitage; for his absence not only helps Duṣyanta in the progress of his love affair but also affords a chance for the demons to obstruct the sacrifices (तत्रभवतः कण्वस्य महर्षेः असान्निध्यात् &c. Act. II.) in consequence of which, the king who was at a loss to know how to re-enter the hermitage to make further



progress in his love-affair, was requested by the hermits to enter the hermitage for their chastisement. **4**. **पश्यामि**—'वर्तमानसामीप्ये वर्तमानवत् वा' ३।३।१३३ इति भविष्यति लट्। **5**. **विदितभक्तिं**—Sixteen words such as भक्ति, प्रिया, कान्ता, क्षान्ता, &c. form the प्रियादि group with which there can be no पुंवद्भाव of the first member by 'स्त्रियाः पुंवद्, भाषितपुंस्काद् अन्-ऊङः, समानाधिकरणे स्त्रियाम् अ-पूरणी-प्रियादिषु' 831. Bhoja opines that भक्ति of the प्रियादि class is derived with क्तिन in the कर्मवाच्य when it means *the object of worship*, hence the rule of prohibition (in विदिता) does not apply, as it is derived with क्तिन् in the भाववाच्य। 'भाववाच्य-साधिते तु पूर्वपदस्य पुंलिङ्गता स्यादेव'—Prabhā under 6. 3. 34.

 King—Charioteer, urge the horses on; we shall sanctify ourselves with a sight of the holy hermitage.

 Charioteer—As the long-lived Sir commands. (*Again notices the speed of the car*).

 **राजा—**(समन्तादवलोक्य) **सूत, अकथितोऽपि ज्ञायते एवायम् आभोगस्तपोवनस्येति।**

 King—(*Looking around*) Charioteer, though not spoken to, these are indeed known as the environs of the penance-grove.

 **सूत—कथमिव ?** Charioteer—How is it ?

 **V. L.**—'आभोगः तपोवनस्य'—B. M. S. 'आश्रमाभोग'—R. 'आश्रमः तपोधनस्य'—V.

 **वैखानस इति**। 'साधयामः' गच्छामः ('प्रायेण ण्यन्तकः साधिर्गमेः स्थाने प्रयुज्यते’ इति विश्वनाथः) 'तावत्' इति वाक्यालङ्कारे। **राजेति**। 'नोदय' प्रेरय। 'पुनीमहे' पवित्रं कुर्महे। \[विनयवचनमेतत्। नृपाणां नित्य-पुण्यत्व-श्रवणात्\]। **राजेति**। 'अकथितोऽपि' केनचित् अनिवेदितोऽपि 'तपोवनस्य आभोगः' पूर्णता सीमारम्भ इति यावत् ('आभोगः वरुणच्छत्रे पूर्णता-यत्रयोरपि' इति विश्वमेदिन्यौ)। 'इति ज्ञायते' लक्षणानि संवीक्ष्य अनुमीयते।

 **18n.—1. साधयामः**—साध + णिच् often in dramas means 'to go' (*Com.*) but *Cf*. 'अयि साधव साधयेप्सितं स्मरणीयाः समये वयं वयः'—*NC. II. 62.* 'साधयाम्यहमविघ्नमस्तु ते'—*Ra. XI. 91*. 'साधयामि गच्छामि'—MN. **2**. **पुण्याश्रमः** &c.—The king is also considered always पुण्य। *Cf*. 'पुण्यः महाब्रह्मसमूहजुष्टः'—*BK. I. 4*. 'भवद्विधा भागवतास्तीर्थीभूता स्वयं प्रभो। तीर्थीकुर्वन्ति तीर्थानि स्वान्तःस्थेन गदभृता'—*Bhāgabat I*, hence the speech only bespeaks his modesty. **3**. **आभोग**—आ+भुज+घञ् भावे = आभोगः परिपूर्णता—Ś—completion, hence by लक्षणा the thing that completes *i. e*. extent, precincts (गण्डाभोग—MD. 90; MM. IX, 16), **4**. **कथमिव**—



सूत is not a keen observer like the king, hence he asks him to explain how he could know that a hermitage was near by.

** राजा—किं न पश्यति भवान् ? इह हि—**

नीवाराः शुकगर्भ-कोटर-मुख-भ्रष्टास्तरूणामधः

(शार्दूलविक्रीड़ितं)

 King—What ! Don't you observe ? For here (*in some places*) beneath the trees are grains of wild rice fallen from the mouths of the tree-holes with parrots nestling within. Somewhere (*again*) intensely oily (*i. e. smooth*) slabs of stones are indicated as being the cleavers of the fruits of *'Hermit's tree'*. The deer by reason of their confidence (*in man*) brook the sounds of the car, without varying their gait; and the paths to the pool are marked with lines of the drippings from the fringes of bark-garments.

Cf. “यो व्रीणाति जयश्रियं रणमुखे' धर्मं वृणीते अध्वरे। तेजोभिः जगदाऽऽवृणोति, वरति ज्ञातीन् यथार्हैः धेनैः॥ सत्कीर्तिञ्च वृणाति, यो वरयति क्षेमं, यशो व्रीयते युद्धे वारयति द्विषो, नि-वरते नित्यं प्रजोपद्रवम्”—KR.

The stone-slabs are excessively oily with its fruits, and this fact suggests that a hermitage is near. **सूच्यन्ते**—Ra. XVII. 50. **3**. **शब्दं सहन्ते**—is significant and corroborates the previous conjecture of the king. A little before a deer was running away at the sight of the king, but here the case is reverse, as herds of deer are roaming freely and do not run away at the sight of men. This



shows that they are domesticated by some hermits. For such a sense of security from molestation is only possible in a hermitage. Cf. 'क्षुद्रान् न जक्षुर्हरिणान् विशश्वसे पक्षिगणैः समन्तात्'—BK.

(*Marking closely*) Oh! how graceful they look. If such a body, rare even in (*my*) seraglio, be possessed by one living in a hermitage, then indeed are the creepers of the garden out-done in points of excellence, by the wood-land creepers. I will wait remaining in this shade. (*Stands gazing*).

 **Remark**—The figure here is निदर्शना (*Com.*) प्रतिवस्तूपमा, दृष्टान्त अर्थान्तरन्यास and निदर्शना are somewhat similar in nature. The first two are but different ways of stating resemblance between two sentences. In प्रतिवस्तूपमा the resemblance is of the nature of *identity* while in दृष्टान्त it is of that of *similarity*. When the relation between two propositions or objects failing to be one of identity, is reduced to one of similarity, the figure is निदर्शना। In दृष्टान्त the two sentences are independent, but they are mutually dependent in निदर्शना। In दृष्टान्त, सामान्य is supported by सामान्य, and विशेष by विशेष, while in अर्थान्तरन्यास, सामान्य is supported by विशेष and vice-versa. In निदर्शना there is no साधारण धर्म।

&c.—**पेलव** (कोमल) is a very happy epithet with Kāli. inspite of the fact that VM, MB and others have prohibited the use of पेलव in literature as it is expressive of *obscene ideas*. Cf. 'पाणिः पल्लवपेलवः। पेलवशब्दस्य आद्याक्षरे अश्लीले—SD. VII.

Mark that नवमल्लिका (Jasmine) blooms in the Spring, (Ra. IX. 42.), whereas नवमालिका in Autumn. (RS. III. 18.) Vide Time Analysis, Act 1.

The act of watering thesaplings of the hermitage generally devolves upon the hermit-girls. Cf. Ra. 1. 51; JH. V. 3; Vik. Il (end). **नियुक्ता**—17n. I. **5**. **न केवलं** &c.—Ra. III. 31. The idea is—I would have watered these plants even in the absence of my father's order to that effect, for I cherish a fraternal affection for them. 6. **सोदर-म्नेहः**—सोदरः means समानम् उदरम् अस्य but the rule ‘विभाषा उदरे’ (*6. 3. 81 : 1016.*) cannot change into स as उदर is not followed by यत्। The rule 'समानस्य छन्दसि अमूर्ध-प्रभृत्युदर्केषु, (*6. 3. 84. 1012.*) can change समान into स but it is restricted to the Vedas only. Hence BD following VM. says *(i)* 'समानस्य' इति योगो विभज्यते। तेन ‘सपक्षः 'साधर्म्यं' 'स्वजातीयम्' इत्यादि सिद्धम् इति 'काशिका'; *(ii)* 'अथवा सह-शब्दः सदृशवचनः अस्ति। सदृशः सख्याः ससखी इति यथा। तेनायम् अस्वपदविग्रहो

HD, however, rejects *(i)* and explains all these by *(ii)*.

 King—Can this be the daughter of Kaṇva ? Undiscriminating must his holiness Kāśyapa be, (*since*) he has appointed her to the duties of the hermitage. The hermit, who hopes to make this guilelessly graceful form inured to penance, surely strives to cleave (*in twain*) a S'ami (*Acacia Suma*)—branch with the edge of the petal of a blue-lotus.

—नीलोत्पल is a kind of water-lily ('नीलसोप्ला इति भाषा'—Kalpa.) This is purposely selected by the poet on account of its exceedingly tender nature. It blooms in the moonshine ('अह्नि अम्भोजं, निशायां विकशति कुमुदम्'—*SD.7.*) and hence too delicate to endure the rays of the sun. *212n. 4*. **7**. **शमी-लतां**—लता means branch (Com.) शमी tree is supposed to contain fire inside. Vide 126n. 4; शमीमिवाऽभ्यन्तर-लीन-पावकाम्—Ra. III. 9. The tree being one of the hardest wood, the disproportionateness between the cutter and the cut is beautifully expressed. This tree has been mentioned purposely, as its branches are always required by the ascetics for kindling fire. MS. VIII. 247. The Śloka is quoted by VK. (SD. VI). For a parallel idea Cf. 'भेत्तुं वज्रमणिं शिरिषकुसुमप्रान्तेन संनह्यते'—NŚ. 5; 'ज्वलितं व्यजनेन पावकं ननु निर्वापयितुं हि कः क्षमः'—RH. IV. 58. **8**. **भवतु**—An अव्यय, generally used when a topic is taken up, leaving aside the old one. (*Supra.*) **9**. **एनां विस्रब्धां पश्यामि**—This act of the king is not at all unbecoming. For unmarried girls can be minutely observed, as otherwise all love marriages will have to be stopped. Elsewhere our hero remarks 'भवतु। अनिर्वर्णनीयं पर-कलत्रम्' (164n. 1) 'अनार्यः खलु परदारव्यवहारः' (248n. 1) where कलत्र or दार means a married woman. Besides the king waited for a suitable opportunity to meet his hostess lest she be confused. Cf. "नायकः—कः दोषः। निर्दोषदर्शनाः कन्यका भवन्ति। किन्तु कदाचित् अस्मान् दृष्ट्वा वालभावसुलभात् साध्वसात् न चिरमिह तिष्ठेत् तदनेनैव तमाल-जालान्तरेण पश्यामः"—*NN. 1*. 'कन्यकादर्शनं निर्दोषम्'—PY.

 **Remark**—From the above conversation it will be noticed that Anasūyā by nature is very meek and does at once what she is requested to do. But Priyaṁvadā is vivacious and saucy and she at once retorts any charge brought against her.

 King—Granted that the bark is ill-suited to her figure, yet it is not that it does not foster the beauty of an ornament.Because—a lotus even though fretted by moss (*Vallisneria*), is charming. The speck though dark, enhances the beauty of the cold-rayed (*moon*). This slender-bodied one is all the loveliereven with (*her*) bark (*garment*). To graceful forms what indeed is not an embellishment?

 **25n.—1. कामम् अनुरूपम्**—Either 'Exceedingly unsuitable'or 'granted that it is unsuitable' (*Com.*) Cf. *Ku. V. 44; Ra. IV. r3; VI. 22; Sl. 28 infra*. **2**. **न पुनः** &c.—पुनः implies भेद (*Com.*). It modifies what is admitted by कामम्। Cf. "A simple maiden in her flower, is worth a hundred coats of arms."—Tennyson. **3**. **वपुषः**—R reads 'वयसः' for 'वपुषः', considering perhaps the previous speech of Priyaṁvadā which refers to Śak.'s youth, but 'वपुषः' is preferable as in the next Śloka the king refers to her form (आकृति) and not to her age (वयस्)। **4**. **न पुष्यति** &c.—Unlike Russian Language two negatives make an affirmative in Sanskrit. Cf. 'प्रत्युवाच तमृषिर्न तत्त्वतस्त्वां न वेद्मि पुरुषं पुरातनम्'—*Ra. XI. 85; VI. 30*; 'न च परिचितः न चाप्यगम्यः'—*Mālā. I. II. MS. VIII. 335; MD. 63, 106; S'PB. I. 35; Vik. 11. 10*. पुष primarily means 'nurture' hence secondarily it means 'possess' or 'exhibit'. Cf. 'पुष्यति अनेकं सरयूप्रवाहः'—*Ra. XVI. 58*. ‘एवमादिभिः आकीर्णः श्रियं पुष्यति अयं गिरिः'—*Rām. II*. There the commentator Rāma remarks 'पुष्यति वर्धयति'। *Ra. VI. 58; XVIII. 32; IV. II ; III. 32. Ku. I. 25 ; VII. 18, 78*. **5**. **सरसिजम्**—सरसि जातम् इति सरसि+जन+ड कर्तरि ('सप्तम्यां जनेर्डः' 3. 2. 97.)= सरसिजम् or सरोजम्।७मी is optionally dropped by 'तत्पुरुषे कृति बहुलम्' 6. 3. 14. This is a योगरूढ़ word, hence etymologically though it means anything that grows in water or in a pond \['सरः नीर-तड़ागयोः'\], yet by usage it means lotus only. **6**. **अनुविद्धं**—अनु+व्यध्+ क्त कर्मणि (व्यध् = विध् 6. 1. 16 ; 2412.) encased. **7**. **लक्ष्मीं**—Unlike नदी, लक्ष्मी has Visarga in the nominative singular. Cf. “अवी-तन्त्री-तरी-लक्ष्मी-ह्री-श्री धीनाम् ऊणादितः। स्त्रीलिङ्गानाम् अमीषान्तु न सु-लोपः कदाचन।” But Cf. again "वाला निदाघलक्ष्मीव

 **28n.—1. विभावयामि**—I guess; UC. II. 24. MM. I. 18. **अपि नाम**—अपि implies a query, while नाम, संभावना। The two together indicate a wish and introduce a question as to whether it will be satisfied. It has the sense of (*a*) 'is it likely', 'may it be'; (*b*) 'would that,' 'I wish that'—*AD. Cf*. 'अपिनाम भवदुपाध्याययजमानस्य निवृत्ता' &c.—*PR*; 'तदपिनाम रामभद्रः पुनरपि इदं वनम् अलङ्कुर्यात्'—*UC.

Cf. 'यदात्मना कृतं तन्मयि संभावयसि'—Rat. II. **3**. **आवर्जयति**—आ–वृज+णिच्+लट् ति। Inverts the pot in order to pour out its contents. Cf. 'आवर्जिताऽष्टापदकुम्भतोयैः'—*Ku. VII. 10*. But आवर्जन generally means 'bending.' Cf. 'त्वदावर्जितवारिसम्भूतम्'—*Ku. V. 34*. 'आवर्जितपूगमालं'—*Ra. XIII. 17 ; XIII. 24 ; XVI. 19. MD. 49*.

 King—Can it be that this (*girl*) is sprung from a wife of an unlike



caste of the chief of the patriarch? Or away with misgivings! She is doubtless fit to be married by a Kṣatriya, since my noble mind has a longing for her. For, to the good, in matters that are subjects of doubts, the promptings of their inner mind are decisive proofs. Nevertheless I will test her rightly.

 **राजेति**। 'अपि नाम' किमेवं सम्भवेत् यत् 'इयं' शकुन्तला 'कुलपतेः' कण्वस्य ‘असवर्णं’ ब्राह्मणात् भिन्नं क्षत्रियादि यत् 'क्षेत्रं' कलत्रं ('क्षेत्रं शरीरे केदारे सिद्धस्थान-कलत्रयोः' दति विश्व-मेदिन्यौ) तस्मात् 'सम्भवः' उत्पत्तिः यस्याः तादृशी। स्यात् (‘शकि लिङ् च’ ३।३।१७२ इति लिङ्) अथवा इति पक्षान्तरे। 'सन्देहेन कृतम्' अलं \['कृतमिति निवारण-निषेधयोः' इति सरस्वती-कण्ठाभरण-वृत्तौ। 'गम्यमानापि क्रिया कारक-विभक्तौ प्रयोजिका' ५६८ इति करणे तृतीया)। **असंशयमिति**। 'असंशयं' निश्चितम् इयं शकुन्तला, क्षतः नाशात् त्रायते इति 'क्षत्रः' क्षत्रिय इत्यर्थः ('क्षत्रः क्षत्रिय-राजन्यौ' इति नाममाला) तस्य, ‘परिग्रहः' स्त्रीत्वेन अङ्गीकारः ('परिग्रहः कलत्रे च मूलस्वीकारयोरपि' इत्यजयः) तस्य 'क्षमा' योग्या। इयं निःसन्देहं क्षत्रियपत्नी भवितुम् अर्हति इति भावः। \[अत्र मत्परिग्रहक्षमा इति वक्तव्ये क्षत्रेति सामान्योक्तेः अप्रस्तुतप्रशंसा\]। 'यत्' येन हेतुना 'आर्यं' कदापि नासत्पथ-प्रवृत्तम्, अतएव श्रेष्ठम् इत्यर्थः। 'मे' पुरुवंशोत्पन्नस्य जितेन्द्रियस्य मम 'मनः अस्यां' शकुन्तलायाम् 'अभिलाषि' सस्पृहं वोढ़ुमिच्छु इत्यर्थः। \[महापुरुषाणाम् आत्मप्रशंसायां न दोषः। तथा च रामायणे—'आर्यरामस्य रामत्वं पश्यन्तु हरियूथपाः'\]। 'संदेहस्य पदेषु' स्थानेषु ('पदं व्यवसित-त्राण-स्थान-लक्ष्याऽङ्घ्रि-वस्तुषु' इत्यमरः) सन्देहविषयीभूतेषु 'वस्तुषु' पदार्थेषु, कर्तव्यम् अकर्तव्यं वा इति संशयास्पदेषु विषयेषु इत्यर्थः, 'सतां' शुद्धशीलानाम् 'अन्तःकरणस्य' चेतसः 'प्रवृत्तयः' गतयः 'हि' इत्यवधारणे ('हि हेताववधारणे' इत्यमरः) 'प्रमाणं' सत्याऽनृतयोः मानदण्डस्वरूपम्। \['सदेहपदेषु वस्तुषु' इत्यत्र पुनरुक्तवदाभास-नामाऽलंकारः। अर्थान्तरन्यासकाव्यलिङ्गाऽनुप्रासाः। अनेन 'परिन्यास' इत्यङ्गमुपक्षिप्तम्। तल्लक्षणं तु दर्पणे 'तन्निष्पत्तिः परिन्यासः'। वंशस्थविलं वृत्तम्\]। **तथापीति**। 'तथापि' शकुन्तलायाः मत्परिग्रह-योग्यत्वे निर्णीते सत्यपि। उपलप्से ज्ञास्ये। इयं ब्राह्मणेतर-क्षेत्र-सम्भूता नवेति पृष्ट्वा अवगमिष्यामि। \[अनेन पूर्वनिर्णयेण अपरितोषः सूचितः\]।



 **29n.—अपिनाम** &c.—The previous conversation between Anasūyā and Priyaṁvadā gives the king an occasion for thinking about the possibility of his being a 'अनुरूप वर'। **2**. **असवर्ण-क्षेत्र-सम्भवा**—समान वर्णः यस्य तत् 'सवर्णम्'। समान with वर्ण is changed to 'स' by “ज्योतिर्-जनपद-रात्रि-नाभि-नाम-गोत्र-रूप-स्थान-वर्ण-वयो-वचन वन्धुषु” 6. 3. 8. Mr. Kale & Prof. G have explained the formations of सवर्ण with the help of योग-विभाग of the Sūtra 'समानस्य छन्दसि' &c. 6. 3. 84. But the question of योगविभाग does not arise at all, when the formation of a word can be accounted for by an *independent* Sūtra (1013). Vide 23n. 6 **क्षेत्रम्**—a wife. न सवर्णम असवर्णम्। असवर्णं क्षेत्रम् = असवर्णक्षेत्रम् a wife not of the same class. तस्मात् सम्भवः यस्याः सा = असवर्णक्षेत्रसम्भवा—an instance of व्यधिकरण बहुव्रीहि sanctioned by VM. 'अवर्ज्यो हि बहुव्रीहिः व्यधिकरणः जन्माद्युत्तरपदः'—KSV. V. 2. 19. But in this particular case, we can avoid it if we derive सम्भव with अप् in the अपादान वाच्य—'सम्भवति अस्मात् इति सम्भवः' *i. e.* orign, hence 'असवर्णक्षेत्रं सम्भवः यस्याः सा' इति समानाधिकरणः बहुव्रीहिः। Vide *MS.—III. 12 & 13*. **3**. **कृतं सन्देहेन**—'कृतम्' (= अलम्) is an अव्यय = enough 'कृतं युगे, अलमर्थे स्याद्विहिते, हिंसिते त्रिषु'—*Medini*. Ra. XI. 41 ; Ki. II. 17. करणे तृतीया। *250n. 2, and MN on* 'अलं महीपाल तव श्रमेण' in *Ra. II. 24.* **क्षत्रपरिग्रहक्षमा**—For Manu says 'पुत्रा येऽनन्तरस्त्रीजाः क्रमेणोक्ता द्विजन्मनाम्। तानन्तरनाम्नस्तु मातृदोषात् प्रचक्षते'—X. 14. **4**. **सतां हि** &c. प्रमाण (standard of guide) is always neuter singular. Now Cf.—वेदोऽखिलो धर्ममूलं स्मृतिशीले च तद्विदाम्। आचारश्चैव साधूनामात्मनस्तुष्टिरेव च'—*MS. II. 6*; 'मनोबुद्धिरहङ्कारश्चित्तं करणमान्तरम्। प्रमाणं नित्यमर्यादा शास्त्रेषु सत्यवादिनि'॥ “अथवा नैतदेवं हि यन्मया परिशंकितम्। मनसो हि मम प्रीतिरुत्पन्ना तव दर्शनात्”॥—*Rām. V. 36. 17*. This stanza and its latter half have been quoted in *DR* and in तन्त्रवार्तिक of *Kumārila Bhatta* respectively.

 King—(*Looking wistfully*) We, through search for truth (*about her*), are undone. O drone, thou indeed are lucky (*here*).

Besides इष्टादि is not an आकृतिगण। Hence say कृतम् इति भावे क्तः। कर्म इत्यर्थः deed. Next भूमार्थे प्रशंसार्थे वा इनिः by ‘अतः इनिठनौ’ 5.2.115 ; 135n. 4. **'वयम्'**= 'अहम्' inspite of its attribute 'हताः'—Vide 159n. 1.

No लुङ by ‘माङि लुङ्’ 3.3.175 as we havehere ‘मा’ and not ‘माङ्’। (Com.). Vide 43n. **4**. कथम् वा आत्मापहारम्&c.—The king is in a fix, for he wanted to conceal his real characterand at the same time refrain from speaking a lie. (Cf.—

‘सत्यंब्रुयात् प्रियं ब्रुयात्’etc.—

*MS. IV. 138*). In fact, if he fibs he is an ‘आत्मापहारक’ andpunishable by law. For Manu says—

‘योन्यथा सन्तमात्मानम् अन्यथा सत्सु भाषते।स पापकृत्तमः लोके स्तेन आत्मापहारकः’—

*IV. 255*. Hence, he resorts to aquibble, but that also misleads the girls. He repeats the sameprocess elsewhere a little after and also at the end of Act, II, on theeve of Vidūṣaka's departure from the forest. Hence he comes underthe charge of deception. We can, however, justify his character,as mendacity in certain cases is not a sin. Cf.—

'विषयभेदे मिथ्या-भाषणेदोषाऽभावः। शर्मिष्ठोवाच। ‘न नर्मयुक्तं वचनंहिनस्ति न स्त्रीषु राजन् न विवाहकाले।

Or construethus ‘यः पौरवेण राज्ञा धर्माधिकारे नियुक्तः भवति’ सोऽहम् etc. **3**. **पौरवेण राज्ञा**—(i) By Duṣyanta. Also (ii) By a king of a Puru line i. e.,Duṣyanta's father. **4**. **धर्माधिकारे**—(i) In supervising religiousrites. (ii) In the seat of judgment i. e., throne. Cf. ‘समः शत्रौ चमित्रेच सर्वशास्त्रविशारदः। विप्रमुख्यः कुलीनश्च धर्माधिकरणोभवेत्’—*MP. 189*.Again ‘धर्मशास्त्रानुसारेण अर्थ-शास्त्रनिरूपणम्।यत्राऽधिक्रियते स्थाने धर्माधिकरणं हितत्’॥ इति वीरमित्रोदये कात्यायन-वचनम्।Thus the whole is a doubleentendre. It may mean : (i) Iam an officer appointed byDuṣyanta to supervise religiousrites in the penance grove(*meant for the girls*), or(ii) I am one appointed byDuṣyanta's father in the seat of judgment (i. e. I am kingDuṣyanta.

NG remarks—‘उत्तरपद-शब्दःसमास-चरमाऽवयवे रूढ़ः, पदेइत्येव सिद्धे उत्तर-ग्रहणात्’ (*Laghu-Śabdendu-Śekhara on 739*. ‘अलुक् उत्तरपदे’6. 3. 1 ; Sk. 831 ; 3n. 5.) In fact the *last member* of the firstcompound is dropped. ‘शाकप्रियः’। इति बहुव्रीहिः। तस्य पार्थिव-शब्देन समासे कृते,पूर्वसमासे **यदुत्तरपदं** प्रियः’ इति तस्य लोपः। तथा ‘देवब्राह्मणः’इत्यत्र‘देवस्य पूजकः, इतिपूर्वस्मिन् षष्ठीसमासे **यदुत्तरपदम्** इति तस्य लोपः ज्ञेयः—T. Hence धर्मस्य इदम् =धर्मार्थम्। धर्मार्थम् अरण्यम् = धर्मारण्यम् ; here अर्थम् (इदम्)—the उत्तरपद of



the first compound, is dropped. This is शाकपार्थिवादिवत् उत्तरपदलोपीकर्मधारय। In fact धर्मार्थम् and अरण्यम् are **two padas**, and therecannot be any मध्यमपद of two पदऽ. Vide also *BM. P. 515*. Or sayधर्मस्यअरण्यम् इति धर्मारण्यम्, अश्वघासादिवत् षष्ठीसमासः698, Read (214n. 3).

Hence it is quite natural that she should like to pass her days amongstthose who are very dear to her.**4**. **अङ्गनाभिः—**अङ्गानि (कल्याणानि) सन्ति आसाम् इति अङ्ग+मत्वर्थे न \[‘अङ्गात् कल्याणे नः’*Vart. 5. 2. 100*\]= अङ्गनाः। ‘अन्यथा अङ्गवती’—Prabha. or अगि (गतौ)+युच्(ऊः-२७८)—BhD.**5**.**निवत्स्यति**(VII. 4. 4.9.)—At the sight of Sak., the idea of marriage flashed in the mind of the king, as a little before his right arm had throbbed. Next from the conversation of the three girls he could know that Śak. would be given in marriage. (Cf. एवमहमपि आत्मनः वरं लभेय&c.) A little after Śak.'s life story was narrated to the king from which he gathered the fact that she was born of a nymph-mother by a Ksatriya. Hence there was no hindrance to his getting her. But all of a sudden two doubts arose in his mind. This Sloka is asked for the solution of these two doubts viz. (i) Whether she, daughter of a Ksatriya king, is to be given in marriage to a Kṣatriya (प्र-दान), in which case the king has a chance. (*Interpretation of the first two lines*) (ii) Whether she, brought up in hermitage, is to be married to a *hermit youth*, so that she may live always in the hermitage in the company of the does.



*(Interpretation of the last two lines*). (Vide Com). This explanation is suggested by R. Some explain—whether she is to be married (*after observing* ब्रह्मचर्य *until* *betrothal*), or she is to observe ब्रह्मचर्य for life. But this explanation seems to go against the saying of प्रियंवदा ie ‘यथा वनज्योत्स्ना अनुरूपेण पादपेन सङ्गता अपि नाम एवमहम् आत्मनः अनुरूपं वरं लभेय इति’—If perpetual celibacy of Sak. was intended by Kanva, then Priyamvadā would not have given *any insinuation of her marriage in that way even in joke.* The idea that she may be given to a hermit youth also occurs to Vidūsaka. Cf. ‘मा कस्यापि तपस्विनः इङ्ग दी-तैल-चिक्कण-शौर्षस्य हस्ते पतिष्यति’—*Act. II. Infra.* (Vide 70n. 1.)

* (In the green room)—*Ye hermits ! be at hand to protect the denizens of the penance-grove. Close at hand, it is reported, is the lord of the earth, Duṣyanta, amusing *(himself)* with the hunting excursion. For the dust, raised by the hoofs of the steeds and



having the (*faded*) sheen of sun-set, is falling on the trees of the hermitage, like a swarm of locusts, on the boughs of which are hung robes of bark, wet with water. Moreover, terrified at the sight of a chariot, an elephant,—having one of his tusks fixed on the shoulder of a tree, which has been struck off with a violent blow,—having been tangled (*as it were*) in a net of creepers dragged along by his breast, and having scattered herds of deer, is entering the sacred grove, like an embodied hindrance to our rites.

The idea is—The elephant while rushing in hot haste through fear, collided violently with the trunk of a tree, which was broken, and adhered to the tusk, but such was the hurry that the tusker had no time to disentangle his tusk from it. R's स्कन्धलग्नैकदन्तः means that his (right) tusk stuck fast on his (right) shoulder as he was running with his face turned (to the right), to see how far the chariot had come. To corroborate his explanation R quotes from पालकाप्य—‘दक्षिणे वलितुं शक्ती गजो वामे प्रयवतः’इति। But there is no reason to believe that the chariot was pursuing the elephant. R, of course, makes mention of our explanation given above taking the whole as one**8. क्रोड़ाक्कष्ट-व्रतति** &c. **वलय—**anything that entwines (Com.). **आसङ्ग—**clinging, hence the whole means 'ad hering coils of creepers”—Vide MN on ‘उत्पलक्षेपवलै’—K. V. 35. As the elephant was rushing, many creepers coiled and coiled round his breast like a noose (पाश), but he had no time to stop and disentangle his bosom from those obstacles, owing to excessive fright and haste. In Ra. V. 46. we- have a description of a wild elephant dragging by his bossom the meshes of moss (जालानि कर्षन् **उरसा**), so क्रोड़ seems to be preferable. Cf. ‘कण्टे कृत्वा शृङ्खलदाम कर्षन्’—Rat.

aka, यवनी('अपनयन्तु भवत्यः मृगयावेषम्—Act. II), वनग्राहिणःetc. accompanied the king in his hunting excursion. In the Mahā. I. 70. 40 even the ministers and पुरोहित



came with the king. Note that पौराः with धिक् takes १मा and not. २या। For reasons vide 9n. 1. or say ‘आत्मनः पौड़ायां न’ ; here धिक् refers to his ownself. Cf. ‘किमाह सौता दशवक्त-नोता हा राम, हा देवर तात मात’—इति विदग्ध-मुख-मण्डनम् । Vide also *T*on *544 ; Ram.

Hence 'आरण्यकः ![](../books_images/U-IMG-1737718778Capture2.PNG) मनुष्यः, हस्तौ वा'—*SK ; II. 13. Infra*. But always **आरण्यः** पशुः \[अरण्य+ण by ‘भरण्याद् णः’, Vart 4. 2. 104.) ; आरण्यकः पशुः, however, may be justified by attaching स्वार्थे कन् after ‘आरण्यः’—*Vide 172n.* 8. Thus M’s *‘by this forest incident’*for ‘आरण्यक-वृत्तान्तेन’is inaccurate. **पर्याकुलाः** ( terrified) has a different meaning in *S7. 27 Supra.* **उटज-गमनाय** - *51n. 1 ; 111. 1*. **3. उत्तिष्ठन्ति**—As upward motion is implied hence Prmp. by ‘उदोऽनूर्ध्वं कर्मणि’1. 3. 24. To Duṣyanta, duty is the foremost affair. So he atonce looks to the peace and tranquillity of the hermitage. (15n. 1). **4. असम्भावित** &c.—The giris could not manage an adequate reception, thus they took the guilt on themselves, indirectly making a strong appeal to the king for a revisit.

Raghunatha*. *T* quotes *HD*, who objects to the necessity of the Vārt.—‘नगशब्दोऽयम् अश्मादिषु पश्यते इति वुञ्छन्—(४।२।८०)



आादिसूत्रेण अस्य सिद्धत्वात् अस्मात् रोऽयं न वक्तव्यः’i. e. we get मत्वर्थे ‘र’after नग as it has been included in अश्मादि class by the Sūtra “वुञ् छण्-क-ठज-इल-से-नि-र-&c.” 4. 2. 80. Hence by this Sūtra we have अश्मर, नगर, पामर,कन्दर and so on; thus the mention of नग in the Vārtika is redundant.**2. अनुयात्रिकान्³**अनुयात्रा(*pursuance*)+मत्वर्थेठन् = अनुयाविकःFactotum तान्। **3. नातिदूरे —**(*Rām. II. 99.9; IV. 27. 11*) From न अतिदूरे, we expected अनतिदूरे by ‘तस्मात् नुड् अचि’6. 3. 74. But this न is different from, though it possesses the meaning of , hence the Samāsa is सुप्सुपा- "नार्थस्य न शब्दस्य सुप्सुपेति समासः" - MBh ; *MN on Ki. 1. 19*. “नैकध”(*Rām. VI. 79. 22 ; 35 ; 97. 15.*) इत्यादौ तु न शब्देन सह सुपसुपेति समासः”—*SK. 756*. Optionally दूरम्, दूरेण दूरात् by ‘दूरान्तिकार्थेभ्यो द्वितीया त’2. 3. 35 ; also oदूरे by ‘सप्तम्यधिकरणे च’2. 3. 36. The king cannot help thinking of Śak., hence he is unwilling to encamp at a great distance, but wants to be near the hermitage. Thus ‘नातिदूरे’is better than ‘अतिदूरे’, Cf. ‘सेनापते, आश्रमसंनिकृष्टे स्थिताः स्मः’and I1.7. Infra. नि+विश्+णिच्means 'to encamp'.—*Vide Ra. V. 42 ; 49 ; Rām. II. 98. 1-2 ; 99. 1; IV. 39. 44.* Now read 149n. 5.**4. धावति**—सृ (‘*to move fast’*) is replaced by ‘धौ’, by the rule ‘पा-घ्रा-ध्मा-स्था-म्ना-&c.’ 7. 3. 78. “शीघ्रगतौ तु 'पाघ्राध्मे—ति धौरादेशः"—*(SK. 2382*. ) Also ‘पत्तिर्धावति’। ‘यमदूतोऽपि धावति’। 'धावति पश्चादसंस्थितं चेतः'। “अनतिवेगे सृ-धातोर्यथा 'तामनुसर सरसीरुहलोचन'। 'धनुषः प्रसरति बाणः' (स्वभावतः गच्छति)। अन्यथा,
गाण्डीवधन्वनी बाणा अभिधावन्ति शाववान्”—*Prabhā.***5. असंस्थित'**—R & M have असंस्तुतम् ‘*not familiar*’, but in that case an additional 'इव' is to be supplied after, it and the sentence will mean, *my mind refuses to go with my body, as though it is not familiar with* it. But this would be going too far, and such an



over-estimate mars the beauty of the poem. Hence असंस्थितम‌्‌‌‍ fa restless (owing to wind, and anxiety about S'ak.) is better. Mark that this very idea has been taken by Bhāravi with असंस्थितम्—“स्वकेतुभिः असंस्थितामादधिरे विभावसोर्विचित्र-चीनांशुक-चारुतां त्विषः’—*Ki. XVI. 58.***6. चीनांशुक** &c.—231n. 2. The poet mentions it in Ku., चीनांशुकैः कम्पितकेतुमालम्’—VII. 3. In the Sakti-sangama Tantra and Mahā., the Chinas are mentioned among the Dasyus of the north and the east of India. Perhaps this name is a later interpolation in the oldest books such as the Mahā., for Maxmuller informs us, that the name China only dates from the Thsin dynasty or from the famous emperor Shi-houngh-Ti, 247 B. C. However silken clothes were at one time largely imported from China. MM. VI. 5; AS. 75; JH. I. IV; BK. X. 60. **केतु** here means both the staff and the flag For somewhat similar idea Cf. “ततो निराशो विलपन् मुहुर्ययौ शरौरेण पुरं न चेतसा”— BC. VI; “तां दूरमपि गच्छन्तीं हृदयं मे अनुधावति । रश्मि र्हि रवि विम्बस्य लम्बते पृथिवीमभि"-Nigamananda-Caritam, Act. II; तत् किं करोमि गरीयसी गुरुराज्ञा प्रभवति देहमात्रकस्य, हृदयेन तु हेमकूट-निवास-व्यसनिना लिखितं जन्मान्तरसहस्रस्य दास्यपत्रम् &c.—Kad. P. 807.

** Time-analysis of Act I.—**The play commences on the first week of the Summer season (Cf. अचिर प्रवृतम् ग्रीष्मसमयम्—Prologue) and our king was perhaps out a-hunting by the end of the spring. We say spring,
because Duṣyanta's hunting excursion has a striking resemblance to that of Daśaratha, made in the spring (Cf. Ra. IX. 48, 49, 55, 59. Also Cf. दिवसाः परिणामः रमणीयाः—prologue. सुखाः प्रदोषाः दिवसाश्च रम्याः ![](../books_images/U-IMG-1737720943Capture2.PNG) ![](../books_images/U-IMG-1737720943Capture2.PNG)चारुतरं वसन्ते’—RS. *VI*. 2.‘रम्य-प्रदोष-समयः स्फुटचन्द्रहासः’—*Ibid. 35*.) Besides the mention of full



bloomed नवमल्लिका flowers corroborates our conclusion, as it blooms in spring (*Cf.* ‘वालातिमुक्तलतिकाम्’—ṚS. *VI*. *17*. नवमल्लिका= माधवी=अतिमुक्तक=फलिनी ; ‘पुष्पञ्च फुल्लं नवमल्लिकायाः’—*Ibid*. *5*. ‘कुसुम-सम्भृतया नवमल्लिका &c.—*Ra*. *IX,* *42.* ‘णबकुसुमजोव्वणा वणजोसिणि’—*S’ak*. I. ‘सहकार फलिनी च’ *etc*.—Ra. *VIII*. *61; S'ak. II. 8.*). Mark that **नवमल्लिका** is a different flower (*of the Autumn*). Its colour is red like that of कङ्केलि or अशोक flower. Cf. ‘कङ्केलिपुष्परुचिरा नवमालिकाश्च’—*RS. III. 18.* Duṣyanta in course of hunting, met the ascetics a little late in the morning, when they were going to collect faggots for the morning sacrifice. (*Cf.* ‘समिदाहरणाय प्रस्थिता वयम्). Some of them had perhaps already performed their morning ablution, as the paths to the reservoir were marked with water dripping from the fringes of the bark-garments. (*Cf*. ‘तोयाधारपथाश्च वल्कल-शिखानिष्यन्दरेखाङ्किताः’)। Some again had commenced sacrifices, as the king was requested to see the rites personally (Cf. ‘तपोधनानां क्रियाः समवलोक्य’&c.) Hence the girls came to water the plants in the morning. (Vide IV. 9. Infra.) The conversation of the trio continued till the rays of the sun caused them to sit under the shade of the Saptaparṇa tree. (Cf. ‘प्रच्छायशीतलायां सप्तपर्णवेदिकायां’ *etc*.’) This was noon. The first act did not perhaps continue for more than three or four hours, since. the bark-garments already found wet, were not fully dried up. (Cf. ‘विटप-विषक्तजलार्द्रवल्कलेषु’&c. *I. 28*.)

Vidūṣaka (*Sighing*)—o (*my evil*) luck ! I am worn out by the companionship of this sport loving king. “Here's a deer”, “There's a hog”,“Yonder's a tiger”, in this way we have to roam even in the noon-tide through long forest-tracts, with summer-thinned tree- shades. The waters of the mountain rivulets, brown owing to the admixture of leaves, (*and hence*) bitter, are drunk. Meals, mostly (*comprised*) of spit-roast meats, are swallowed at irregular hours. With my joints all bruised by pursuing (*the king*) on horse-back, there is not sufficient sleep even at night. Then I am awakened, even at the earliest dawn, by the whoresons—the bird-catchers, with their *wild*) halloo of taking a forest. With all these, even now my troubles do not come to an end. A (*fresh*) boil has formed on the top of the abscess. Indeed yesterday when we were lagging behind, His Majesty entering the region of the hermitage in pursuit of a deer, was shown by my ill luck, the hermit's little daughter (*named*) Śakuntalā. Now (*he*) does not think of returning to the city at all. Even as I was musing thus, night passed away (*and*) the dawn broke upon my eyes. What is to be done ? I will just



see him when he has finished his usual (*morning*) duties and decorations. (*Turning and looking about*) Here is coming, my dear friend, in this very direction, surrounded by bow-handed Yavana girls, wearing wreathes of wild flowers. Very well, appearing as if palsy-crippled I will stay (*here*), if even thus I may get (*some*) respite. (*This said, stands leaning on his wooden staff*).

**55n.—1.** **विदूषकः** &c.–Vidūṣaka is the humorist and confidant of the hero (*generally of the king*) His chief duty is to excite laughter, by his crooked form, quaint dresses and repartees of wit and to help the hero in his love-intrigues. He is a confessed votary to the pleasures of the table (**MK. IV.** after Śl. 27) and has access to the seraglio. As he has full liberty of speech, his presence enlivens the dull monotony of amour of the last act. According to **K** he acts the विष्कम्भक or अधमप्रवेशक (*82n. 11*.) by alluding to what happened in the interval of the acts. **विषस्सः**— Dejected 2271 ( Com. ) **2**. **दिष्टम्**—The jester is bewailing his own ill-luck as he is to follow the king in season and out-season.

Cf. “आजानुलम्बिनी माला सर्वर्तुकुसुमोज्ज्वला। मध्ये स्थूलकदम्बाढ्या वनमालेति तत् स्मृता”—Sabdamālā. **23.** **यवनीभिः**—There are two feminine forms from यवन viz. (i) यवनी (यवनस्य पत्नी)। (ii) यवनानी (यवनानां लिपिः। 'यवनाद् लिप्याम्’—Vārt. 4. 1. 49.) In old times Yavana women were employed as attendants of the kings. girls, as Kāli. \[*in Ra IV. 60 & 61*.\] has described *Persian woman* as Yavanī, Cf. 'पारसीकां स्ततो जेतुं ![](../books_images/U-IMG-1737292593Capture2.PNG) ![](../books_images/U-IMG-1737292593Capture2.PNG) ![](../books_images/U-IMG-1737292593Capture2.PNG) यवनी-मुखपद्मानां॥ Almost every orientalist from the time of *Sir William Jones*, to that of Dr. Muller, says that a exclusively means the *Greek*. But it was the custom of the Yavanas to get their heads wholly shaved. Cf. ('यवनानां शिरः सर्वं, काम्बोजानां तथैव च। पारदा मुक्तकेशाश्च, पह्लवाः श्मश्रुधारिणः'॥) This, the national custom of the Greeks, could never sanction ; for when *Demosthenes* got his head shaved, he sought to conceal himself in a cell, in order that he might not appear in the public.



In fact like the 'Bactrian' of the Greeks and the Romans, Yavana was a very elastic term with the Hindus who applied it to the various foreigners, who from time to time invaded India i. e. the *Persians, Greeks, Bactrians, Scythians*, &c. Mr. Balfour has rightly observed (*Encyclopaedia of India*)—"Doubtlessly Yavana is a term not exclusively applied to the Greeks.” (*Vide also 'Indo-Aryan"Vol. II. P. 166 et. seq.*)

But when not preceded by उपसर्ग, उपधा of नम is *optionally* lengthened by 'ज्वल-ह्वल-झल-नमाम् अनुपसर्गात् वा। एषां मित्त्वं वा। ज्वलयति ज्वालयति। उपसृष्टे तु नित्यं मित्त्वम्। प्रज्वलयति। कथं तर्हि'प्रज्वालयति' 'उन्नामयति' इति ? घयन्त्यात् 'तत्करोति' (वाः—३।१।२६) इति णौ—*SK. 2353*. **3**. **सह-वसति**—'सह' एकत्र ‘वसतिः’, सहसुपेति समासः २।१।४ ताम्। Cf. 'सहोपजातपरिचयः'—Kād **मुग्ध** &c.—मुह्+क्तः = मुग्धः or मूढ़ः (57n. 1). मुग्ध means guileless, hence charming.. The deer being the constant companion of my beloved, instructed her in casting artlessly sweet glances. For a similar idea, Cf.



'प्रवातनीलोत्पलनिर्विशेषम्अधीर-विप्रेक्षितमायताक्ष्या। तया गृहीतं नु मृगाङ्गनाभ्यः ततोगृहीतं नु मृगाङ्गनाभिः'—*Ku. 1. 46*, also “लङ्कास्त्रीणां पुनश्चक्रेविलापाचार्यकं शरैः”—*Ra. XII. 78*. Now read the remark below.

**Remark—**B's “लोचन-कान्ति-संविभागः” also gives a very good sense. It means “*They have, as it were, distributed the beauty of their eyes to S'akuntalā*.” It has a parallel in Kād. P. 537—“सर्व - हरिणैरिव दत्त-लोचन- शोभा-संविभागम्” ; so it will be impossible for the king to hurl his arrows to the deer, for this will remind him of the eyes of his beloved. Exactly similar idea is found in “त्रासाति-मात्रचटुलैः स्मरतः सुनेत्रैः प्रौढ़-प्रियानन- विभ्रम-चेष्टितानि॥” —Ra. IX. 58. Thus it is difficult to say which is genuine, as both the readings are supported by parallel ideas.

General (*Aside*)—Friend, be steady in (*your*) opposition. I will but sail close to the humour of our lord. (*Aloud*) This blockhead is raving. Surely Your Majesty himself is (*our*) example. The body with (*its*) belly growing attenuated from the reduction of fat, becomes light (*and*) capable of (*high*) exertion. The minds of animals, agitated by anger and dismay, are noticed too. The superiority of the archers lies in the fact that their arrows succeed in (*hitting*) a moving mark. Falsely indeed, do they call hunting a vice. Where else is (*to be found*) such pleasure ?

Cf. 'बालातपः प्रेतधूमः वर्ज्यं भिन्नं तथासनम्'—*M.S. IV*. 69. where K quotes *Medhātithi*—'प्रथमोदिताऽऽदित्यतापः बालातपः। स च मुहुर्तत्रयंयावत् इति मेधातिथिः' ; PP 1, 55, 66; 'सुखासीनोभवामि'—Vik. III. **4**.**शिलातले—**तल****means both 'स्वरूप' and 'अधः'। 'अधः स्वरूपयोऽस्त्री तलम्' इत्यमरः; Hence शिलातले=



शिलायाम् (शिलापृष्ठे इत्यर्थः)। Similarly, भूमितलम्, करतलम् but वृक्षतले—under the tree. **अनवाप्त-चक्षुःफल—Cf.** 'द्रष्टव्यम् अपश्यन्ती वञ्चयसि लोचनयुगलम्'—*Kād. p. 329.* “अद्य परिसमाप्तम् ईक्षण-युगलस्य द्रष्टव्य-दर्शन-फलम्”—*Kād. p. 481*. **5**. **ननु भवान् &c.**— ननु is indicative of *disapproval*.

Hence ललामेन (or ललास्ना वा) भूता = ललामभूता। The समास is 'सुप्सुपा' as 'भूत' is not included in 'पूर्व सदृश-समोनाथं—कलह-निपुण-मिश्र-श्लक्ष्णैःः' 2. 1. 31. MN also explains 'प्रत्यर्थिभूताम्' in Ku. 1. 59. as सुप् सुप् Samāsa. But there is a serious difficulty. For 'भूत', निभ, प्रतिम, &c. have the meaning 'तुल्य' only when they are final in a compound (उत्तरपद). Hence 'ललामेन भूता' cannot mean 'ललामेन तुल्या' asभूत is not here a final member in a compound. *BhD* commenting on “निभ-संकाश-निकाश-प्रतीकाशोपमादयः—AK” remarks—\['अमी निभादयः उत्तरपदस्था एव सदृशवचनाः वाच्यलिङ्गाः स्युः। यथा 'पितृनिभः' पुत्रः ; 'मातृनिभा कन्या'। ![](../books_images/U-IMG-1737467899Capture2.PNG) 'आदिना भूत-रूप-कल्पादयः। यथा पितृभूतः, मातृभूतः—पितृरूपः, पितृकल्पः'\] Thus being the case, say 'ललाभेन इव (तुल्या) इति 'ललामभूता' इति अस्वपदविग्रहः नित्यसमासः Cf. “सामान्यमिव सामान्यभूतम्। भूतशब्द उपमार्थो।यथा पितृभूतः इति”—KT **अधिकृत्य**—'मुद्रामधिकृत्य'—*Mālā II ; Ra.

**68n.—1.** **न एनां पश्यसि**\* **अवादौः**—The construction will appear queer from the standpoint of classical Sanskrit, as the previous action (**दर्शन**) is in the present tense, while the action following (**वचन**) is in the past tense, but it is quite regular from the standpoint of Vedic grammar. लट् may be used for लङ् by 'सर्वे' विधयः छन्दसि वैकल्पिकाः', and by “छन्दसि लुङ्-लङ्-लिटः" (3. 4. 6) लङ्, लुङ् लिट् may be used for any tense.

विस्मयः समुत्पन्नः”—Rat. II. **2**. **परिकल्पितः &c.**—सत्त्वयोग = infusion of life ; परिकल्पितः सत्त्वयोगः यस्याः = परिकल्पितसत्त्वयोगा—one who is inspired with life (*by the creator*). Cf. 'परिकल्पित-सान्निध्या'—Ra. IV. 6. **3**. **रूपोच्चयेन**—With a collection of all that is beautiful. It is the material cause (समवायिकारण)। Cf. 'सर्वोपमा-द्रव्य-समुच्चयेन यथाप्रदेशं विनिवेशितेन। सा निर्मिता विश्वसृजा प्रयत्नादेकस्थसौन्दर्यदिदृक्षयेव'—*Ku. I. 49.* Cf. also the description of 'Urbaśī' in *Vik. I. 8*. ; MM I. 21. **4**. **मनसा कृता नु**—नु suggests an alternative (Com.), मनसा—करणे श्या। This is the instrumental cause (निमित्त-कारण)। The idea is—The creator was so very particular about such a flaw-less beauty that he did not even touch her with hands or brush, but created her mentally, so that her beauty might not be tarnished by touch. For a similar idea, Cf. 'मन्ये' च मातङ्ग-जाति-स्पर्श-दोष-भयात् अस्पृशता इयमुत्पादिता प्रजापतिना, अन्यथा कथमियम् अक्लिष्टता लावण्यस्य। नहि कर-तल-स्तर्श क्लेशितानाम् अवयवानाम् ईदृशी कान्तिः'—*Kād. p. 42*. Also 'प्रजापतिकर-दृड़-निपीड़ितमध्य-भाग' &c.—P. 690; 'एनामुत्पादयतो विधेः करतल-परामर्शक्लेशेन' &c. *P. 702 **5.*****स्त्री-रत्न-सृष्टिरपरा**—रमन्ते अस्मिन् इति रम+न \['रमेस्त च' ऊः—301\] = रत्नम्, स्त्रीणाम् रत्नं (श्रेष्ठम्) =स्त्रीरत्नम्। This may refer to the creation of तिलोत्तमा (आद्या स्त्रीरत्नसृष्टिः) by the creator himself for the destruction of the demons 'सुन्द' and 'उपसुन्द'। Read “श्रीभगवानुवाच॥ तिलोत्तमा नाम पुरा ब्रह्मणा योषिदुत्तमा। तिलं तिलं समुद्धृत्य रत्नानां निर्मिता शुभा”॥१॥—*Mahā*. (अनुशासन-पर्वे' उमा-महेश्वरनामाध्यायः)। In the Ādi. *(2. 11. 15. q. v.),* however, she is said to be created byविश्वकर्मा by the order of



Brahmā. The poet means to say that this Śak. is another (अपरा अन्या अपूर्वा—K.) matchless creation of the most perfect beauties of the creator. According to C and Ś, अपरा refers to Lakṣmī, the goddess of beauty. In MKवसन्तसेना is termed Lakṣmī by Vita—'अपद्मा श्रीरेषा'—V. 12 ; Also Cf. “**अपरमिव** पुरुषद्वेषि-प्रजापति-निर्माणम्”—Kād. p. 673 ; '**अयमपरः** मुनिमायामयो मकरकेतुरुतपादितः'—*p. 542*. 'रजनि-कर-कला-कलाप-लायण्येन निर्मिता![](../books_images/U-IMG-1737465494Capture2.PNG)भगवती **द्वितीयेव गौरों &c**.—p. 528. Or, अपरा means अविद्यमाना परा यस्याः—That which has no match, nonpareil. **6**. **धातुः विभुत्वम्** &c.—Brahmā is not only a धाता (*creator, protector*, डुधाञ्धारणपोषणयोः)but he is alsoविभुः (*all-powerful, omnipotent*). So it has been possible for him only to create such a nonpareil beauty (cf. “कथं नु ![](../books_images/U-IMG-1737465494Capture2.PNG)![](../books_images/U-IMG-1737465494Capture2.PNG)निर्मातुं प्रभवेत् मनोहरमिदं रूपं पुराणो मुनिः”—*Vik, I. 8*.). Despite his omnipotence, the creator had to faultless figure first, and later on he infused life-breath into it, or methinks the creator-created her mentally. (*For reasons vide n. 4*). For the same idea differently expressed, Cf. 'या तत्र स्यात् युवति-विषयेसृष्टिराद्येव धातुः—*MD. II. 22. Dr. Wilson* quotes the following from Milton describing Eve—"Oh, Fairest of cration ! last and best of all God's works"—Paradise Lost, Bk. IX. 896; also cf. "Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature"—*Othello. V. 2* ; "So perfect that the gods who formed you wondered. At their own skill and cried, A lucky hit has mended our design"—*Dryden, (All For Love, I.)* In the last half**‘अनुचिन्त्य’** has its nominative (अहम्) understood, while the nominative of 'प्रतिभाति'—is a different word 'सा'। This goes against the rule 'समान-कर्तृकयोःपूर्वकाले' 3. 4. 21 ; i. e. the nominatives of the infinite verb with क्ताच् (orल्यप्), and the 



finite verb must be the same. For such anomaly, read *MD. 12 ; Vik. II. 10 ; 60n. 1*. The difficulty of एककर्तृकत्व is removed by considering such verbs as **'स्थित,' 'उद्यत',** **'व्यवसित'**, &c. to be **understood** after the infinite verb. Read—"इह 'पुत्रंदृष्ट्वा 'दुःखं भवति' ; 'शत्रुं दृष्ट्वा दुःखं भवति' ; 'पापं कृत्वा अनुतापः स्यात्' ; रथे तु वामनं दृष्ट्वा पुनर्जन्म न विद्यते' इत्यादौ 'स्थितस्य' इति पदम् अध्याहार्यम् (उह्यम्)”—Prabhā ; T. 3329. **7**. According to R, there is—'समाप्तपुनरात्तता' दोष in this Śloka, as the sentence seems to be complete in the third line, and the fourth line seems to be a *separate* sentence. Hence he remarks 'तृतीय-चतुर्थ चरणयोः व्यत्यय-पाठेन समाप्तपुनरात्तदोषः परिहर्तव्यः' i. e. the 3rd and 4th lines should change places.

**विदूषकः—जइ एव्वं पञ्चादेसो दाणिं रुबवदोणं** \[यदि एवं, प्रत्यादेश इदानीं रूपवतीनाम्\]।

 King—This again occurs to my mind. Her spotless beauty is (*like*) a flower (*as yet*) un-smelt, a tender sprout not (*yet*) torn by finger-nails, a gem not (*yet*) perforated, fresh mead whose flavour is not (*yet*) tasted, (*or*) like the very fruit of pious deeds not (*yet*) divided.

** 74n.—1.** **अहो—**Implies astonishment on the part of the hermit boys, as they found practically no difference between the king and the sage. But his appearance though imposing is trust-inspiring.

(*Vide n. 1*.) So it is preferable to **'नातिभिन्ने'** (R). Duṣyanta is a राजर्षि, so one degree below a 'Rsi'. (Vide Rām.

Cf. 'स प्रीति-योगात्'—Ku. VII. 55. 'सान्निध्य-योगात्'—Ra. VII. 3 ; The king is the owner of a sixth part of तपः (*merit*)—72n. 7. In the case of मुनि, रक्षा-जगद्रक्षा, शरीररक्षा—preservation of his body or safety of the world. This is the second point of similarity. **6**. **वशिनः—  **



The sages are surely the controller of passions (*Gītā II. V*), so was the king; besides he was also to control the vicious propensities of the wicked. (*Ra. VI. 39*). This is the third point of similarity.**7. चारण-द्वन्द्व—**Celestial choristers—a kind of गंधर्व whose duty was to amuse the denizens of heaven by panegyrics. “गन्धर्वाणां ततो लोकः परतः शतयोजनात्। देवानां गायनास्ते चारणाः स्तुतिपाठकाः”—Pp “किंकिणी वाद्यवेदी च तो विकटनर्तकैः। मर्मज्ञः सर्वरागेषु चतुरश्चारणो मतः”—*SR*. **द्वन्द्व—** द्वौ द्वौ इति द्वन्द्वम् ; हि is doubled and the form is obtained by निपातन; "द्वन्द्वं रहस्य-मर्यादावचन-व्युत्क्रमण-यज्ञपात्र-प्रयोगाऽभिव्यक्तिषु” (8.1.15) इति साधुः'—*BhD.* “द्विशब्दस्य द्विर्वचन पूर्वपदस्य अस्मावो अत्वम् उत्तरपदस्य नपुंसकत्वं च निपात्यते”—*BD*. It is also masculine, cf. 'चार्थे' द्वन्द्वः' 2. 2. 29. **8**. **केवलं राज-पूर्वः—**This is the only point of difference. *In Ra. II. 58* Dilīpa is addressed as ‘राज्याश्रममुनि'। Cf. “प्रपच्छ कुशलं राज्ये राज्याश्रममुनिं मुनिः”।

 द्वितीयः—गौतम, अयं स बलभित्सखो दुष्यन्तः ?

 Second Hermit—Well, then it is no wonder, that this one, with arms long as the (*iron*) bar of the city-gate, alone rules the whole earth with the ocean for it is murky bourn. For when



hostilities are commenced with the demons, the gods expect victory in battles from his braced bow as much as from the thunder- bolt of Indra.

of a sacrifice. \["गच्छेयं स्व-शरीरेण देवतानां परां गतिम्”—Rām, 57.12\]. Vaśisṭha refusing to officiate, he approached his sons, who cursed him to be a candāla. Viśvāmitra, however, celebrated the sacrifice for him, but the gods did not take part in it. So he by his own power caused the king to go up. \[“पश्य मे तपसो वीर्यं स्वार्जितस्य नरेश्वर। एष त्वां स्वशरीरेण नयामि स्वर्गमोजसा—*Ibid. 60, 13*. “दिवं जगाम काकुत्स्थः मुनीनां पश्यतां तदा"—*60.16*\].

Triśanku falling down, his downfall was arrested by Viśvā mitra saying—'*Stay Tris'anku, stay there*. \[रोषमाहारयत् तीव्रं 'तिष्ठ' 'तिष्ठेति चाब्रवीत्॥—(60, 20\]. Thence forward that unhappy king remained suspended in the region of the stars.

requests the jester not to take seriously what was said before (*i. e. the fact that he was enamoured of a hermit girl*). For she being a woman brought up in the forest and having no culture and art (n. 5) has no power to cater for the peculiar taste of a King, a townbred individual who is intimately acquainted with the beautiful accomplished ladies of the society. Hence any attachment between them is not within the nature of things and hence absolutely absurd. Mark that the duplicity of the king does not stigmatise his character—Vide 37n. 1. The king does not like to offend anyof his consorts for whom at present he has practically no real love. For this दाक्षिण्य—*Vide. 195n. 4.* 'अन्वसंक्रान्तहृदयोऽपि प्रथमसंभावनाम् अपेक्षते'— Sānumati's speech. Act. *VI. infra.*

** Remarks:—**Our poet very skillfully introduces the summons of the queen mother, with a view to removing Vidūṣaka from the scene of Duṣyanta's courtship with Śak., which plays an important part in the development of the plot. From the last verse, the jester is made to believe that the alleged love between the king and Śak. is sham. Thus the last shadow of Śak.'s affair is blotted out of his memory. The Jester's ignorance of the Gāndharva marriage, is a sine qua non as the slightest knowledge in him would give rise to an impossible situation in the 5th Act by baffling the imprecation of Durbāsā. For he being a veritable babbler, would have told others about it and himself being an eye-witness would have surely remembered her face.

** Time-analysis of Act II.**—The Second Act commences early in the morning of the next day after the events described in Act. I. (“ह्यः किल अस्मासु अवहीनेषु '&c.' एवमेव चिन्तयतः मे प्रभाता अक्ष्णोः रजनी”—*Vidūṣaka's speech*).The season is the same ('ग्रीष्मविरलपादपच्छायासु')।The conversation of Vidūṣaka & the king ended late in the noon (अस्मिन् पादप-च्छायाविरचितवितानसनाथे &c.)।

'निर्वाण' generally means '*blown out*'. Cf. 'निर्वाणे दीपे किमु तैलदानम्' । 'निर्वाणवैरदहनाः प्रशमादरीणाम्'— *VS'. 1. 7.* 'शनैः निर्वाणमाप्नीति निरिधन इवानलः'— *Mahā;Ra. XII. 1*. Next *'absolute extinction' or* *'annihilation of individual or worldly existence,* which is deemed by the *Buddhists to be the Magnum Bonum* or the highest felicity. *Prof. Goldstucker* opines that as this meaning was not in vogue at the time of Pāṇini, he must be *anterior to**Buddha*, But निर्वाण in this very sense occurs in the Gitā. Cf 'स्थित्वास्यामन्तकालेऽपि ब्रह्मनिर्वाणमृच्छ्रति'—*II. 72,* but it is controversial whether the Gitā was originally a portion of the *Mahā* which is certainly anterior to Buddha. For the above sense in classical literature, cf. 'प्रसक्ते निर्वाणे हृदय प्ररितापं वहसि किम् ? — *Mālā III. 1; SPB. IV. 28; VS. III. 21; Ki XI. 69.* Cf.' नेत्रनिर्वाणाम्' with Bhavabhūti's 'लक्ष्मीः इयम् अमृतवर्तिनयनयोः*&c*—*UC. I 39.*

The affix expected was ‘अ’ by \[ ‘गुरोश्च हल्’ 3. 3. 100\], hence घञ् is irregular (बाहुलकात्)। ‘आतङ्कस्फुरितकठोरगर्भगुर्वी’ — *UC*. 3. **बलवान् खलु** &c.— This totally refutes the theory that the use of ‘बलवत्’ as an *adjective is un—Kālidāsian.* Cf. ‘बलवान् पुनर्मम मनसोऽभितापः’ — Vik.

of; ‘न अभ्यन्तराः’—not familiar with. ‘वयम्’ refers to the hermit-girls in general. 5. **इतिहास-निबन्धेषु**—इत्येवं ‘ह’ किल*(Thus it was in past times)* = इतिह—narration of past events (i. *e*, Stories and traditions) Cf. “पारम्पर्योपदेशे स्यादैतिह्यम् इतिहाऽव्ययम्”—*AK*. ‘इतिह’ आस्ते अस्मिन् इति इतिह+ आस + घञ् \[ ‘हलश्च’ 3. 3. 121\] = इतिहासः a book having the narration of past events. Don’t say इतिह + अस (अस्ति) + घञ्, for अस् with घञ् will be changed into ‘भू’ (2.4.52). Now Cf. “धर्मार्थकाममोक्षाणाम् उपदेशसमन्वितम्। पूर्ववृत्तम् कथा युक्तम् इतिहासंप्रचक्षते”—*qtd*. *Nīlkanṭha*. 6. **समवस्था—**(S) is the best reading. For the word is a *Kālidāsian peculiarity,* and generally used by Kāli in the sense of ‘अवस्था’ (a pitiable) condition. Cf. ‘बल्लकी समवस्थाम्’—*Ra. VIII. 41*. ‘कामयानसमवस्थया’—*XIX*. *50*. ’द्वेसमवस्ये क्षणादूढ़े’—*Malā. IV.* 7. ‘राजा निराकरणविक्लवायाः \*समवस्थाम्’—*Śak. VI; 137n. 3.*7. **परमार्थतः**=परमार्थेन, तसि has the sense of करण। Cf. “प्रयोगानुसारेणसर्वाभ्यः प्रकृतिभ्यः परः सर्वासां विभक्तीनां स्थाने तसिल् प्रत्ययोभवति वा”—*Prabhā*. “मन्त्रोहीनः स्वरतो वर्णतोवा मिथ्याप्रयुक्तः नतमर्थमाह” &c,—शिक्षाof Pāṇini, **अनारम्भः**—Ra.

**93n.— 1. दर्शन-पथ** &c. — Cf. 'यस्य नेत्रयोः पथि स्थिता त्वम्' — *Vik. I.* ***ताप-हेतुः**—* Applicable to both 'अभ्रश्यामदिवस' and 'स्मर'A cloudy day produces great heat but it is most oppressive just on the eve of the shower. Similarly Cupid was extremely painful when S'ak was just going to make a clean breast of the whole affair. Cf. “तीव्रः स्मरसंतापो न तथादौ बाधते यथासन्ने तपति प्रावृषि नितरामभ्यर्णजलागमोदिवसः”*— Rat. (III. 10.) qtd. K. 2.* **निर्वापयिता** (७।३।३६) — After a great shower the cloudy day becomes extremely delightful. Similarly



by the declaration of S'ak Cupid gave comfort to the king. 3. **अभ्र–श्यामा** अभ्र= cloud. In mathematics it means '*zero*'. अपो बिभर्ति इति अप्+भृ+क (मूलविभूजादित्वात् *3.2.5.)* अभ्रम्। अभ्रis the हेतु of श्यामत्व । R's अर्धश्यामis not a good reading. According to his view the day which in the morning is cloudless, produces heat on account of the bright rays of the sun, and when it is clouded in the evening it becomes delightful. It is evident that his meaning is forced, and unlike 'स्मर' which is cause of both 'ताप' and 'निर्वाण', ‘अर्धश्यामत्व' is the cause of 'निर्वाण' only, and 'अर्धाऽश्यामत्व' is the cause of 'ताप'। Again in this reading the cause of श्यामत्व *is* *to* *be* *inferred* which is not desirable. Kāli elsewhere also speaks of 'अभ्रश्यामदिवसः' Cf. “मेघश्यामा दिशोदृष्ट्वामानसोत्सुकचेतसाम्”*— Vik.

** 96n.—1**. **अशिशिरैः**&c.—According to the poetic convention, tears of *joy* are *cold* and those of *grief* are *hot*, hence the— propriety of the epithet अशिशिरैः।Cf. 'आनन्दशीतामिव वाष्पवृष्टिम्*—Ra. XIV. 44.* 'आनन्दजः शोकजमश्रु वाष्पस्तयोरशीतं शिशिरो विभेद’*—XIV.* 3. 'उष्णैः विरह-महतिमश्रुभिः यापयन्तीम्*— MD. II. 28; Ra. XII. 4; 62; ΧΙΧ.* 36. Mark also that our poet uses the word वाष्प with reference to the tears of joy which are by themselves not so copious and flowing, as those arising from grief which are called अश्रु। 2. **भुज-न्यस्त** &c.— This and the following lines have been often misunderstood. *M* whom we have followed, first offers the correct explanation. The king we have considered as passing several nights in a sitting posture, with his left arm (*palm*) raised to support his cheek. 'भुज' is explained as the *palm* *of* *the* *left* *hand*, cf. **\['वाम-**कपोल-शयनीकृत-करतलया'*—Kād. P. 583\]* for the king being a right-hand archer, the friction of the bowstring will produce callosities on the left-hand. Hence अपाङ्ग also means the outer corner of the left eye which was placed on his left palm. 3. **अनभिलुलित** &c.—अभि + लुल + क्त + कर्मणि अभिलुलितः pressed, touched. 'लुल विमर्दने'—*KK*. 'सौत्रधातुरयम्'—*Durgādāsa*. The callosities are produced by the friction of the bow-string in the *fore-arm* a little below कफोनि (*elbow*) and above the *wrist*-*joint*, *but* *not* *on* *the* *wrist*. *Now* bangles are always worn in the *fore*-*arm* (प्रकोष्ठ) *which* *is* *nearest* *to* *the* *wrist* *joint*. Mark also that प्रकोष्ठ is a wide term meaning the entire hand from the elbow to the wristjoint (मणिबन्ध) Cf. 'प्रकोष्ठमन्तरं विद्यात् अरत्रिमणिबन्धयोः'*—Kātya.* 'रामप्रकोष्ठार्पितं विभ्रत्काञ्चनमेकमेव वलयम्'*—Ś AK.VI.*



6\. कनकवलयभ्रंशरिक्तप्रकोष्ठः—*MD*—*2.*But because bangles are worn on that part of प्रकोष्ठ which is nearest to मणिबन्धः, प्रकोष्ठ often in Kalidāsa is met with in the sense of मणिबन्ध Cf—‘ततः प्रकोष्ठे हरिचन्दनाङ्किते &c’—*Ra.III.59*. where *MN*. says ‘प्रकोष्ठे मणिबन्धे’।Again Kāli has clearly pointed out in *Māla* that bangles are worn near the wrist-joint (मणिबन्ध). Cf .वामं सन्धिस्तिमितवलयम्*—Act. II.6.*where*K* remarks “सन्धिस्तिमितवलयं सन्धौ मणिबन्धे स्तिमितं निश्चलं वलयं कङ्कनं यस्य सः”॥ Also ‘वामं सन्धिस्तिमितवलयम्’ &c*—DP.*Now the part of the hand towards the elbow is *fatter* than the part nearer to the wrist-joint. Hence in natural condition the bangle will always touch the callosities of the bowstring. The king owing to uneasiness caused by the pangs of love used to pass the whole night in a *sitting posture.*Thus owing to constant wakefulness the king—s body was emaciated and the callosities were not sufficiently prominent through emaciation and disuse of the bow. Hence in a sitting posture with his cheek upon his palm the bangle would slip down from its natural place towards the elbow without touching the scar produced on the upper part of the fore arm. The followers of R take the king to pass the night in a *lying posture*, the left arm being used as a pillow. In this explanation as the bangle slips from मणिबन्ध to the tips of the finger **अनभिलुलित** &c.becomes redundant.Through sheer absent-mindedness the king forgets that the bangle, even though put in its proper position will not remain there. Elsewhere (84n.5) he, for a similar reson, refers to the unbearableness of the moon-beam at mid-day.*Now read the lovelorn condition of* पुण्डरीक *in Kad.p. 581-585.*

Śak* had already betrayed her love to the king and that fact has been doubly corroborated now by her thrilling cheeks, hence the king remarks that his gaze on S'ak has been quite meet. But elsewhere (*164. 2*) when he could not recognise her, he remarked 'भवतु, अनिर्वर्णनीयम् परकलत्रम्'। Cf.

not close by, 'धा' = ‘हि' \['दधातेः हिः' *7. 4. 4*2.\] Here *negation* is *prominent*, hence नञ् is प्रसह्यप्रतिषेध। So says *VK*.—“अप्राधान्यं विधेर्यत्रप्रतिषेधे प्रधानता। प्रसह्य-प्रतिषेधोऽसौ क्रियया सह यत्र नञ्”। So समास is prohibited. But this is not strictly observed as Pāṇini himself has made समास with प्रसह्यपतिषेधनञ्। Cf. 'आदेच उपदेशे अशिति' 6. 1. 45. 'अशिति प्रसह्यप्रतिषेधः इत्याह, नतु शिति इति'—T. 2370. 5. **लेखन-साधनानि**—211n. 1. Many European scholars headed by *Dr. Bhuler* opine that Sanskrit scripts originated from the letters of the *Moabite stones* and *Assyrian weights* which were introduced in India at about 800 B. C. But Pāṇini (*at least 800 B. C.-Dr. Gold Stucker*) gives the formation of two words 'लिपिकर', 'लिविकर' (3.2.21) in his grammar, and in his धातुपाठ writes 'लिख—अक्षर-विन्यासे, अङ्क-चिह्न करणे &c. Even written books were known in his time. (*1. 3. 76; IV. 3. 87; IV. 3. 116.*). S'ākatāyana also gives the derivation of लिपि (*U. 4. 120*). *Dr. Auphret and Late Umes'a Candra Vidyaratna,* the redoubtable Vedic Scholar have independently of each other pointed out that the अक्षर in the *RV (1. Mandala, Hymn CLXIV, Verses 24 & 27 )* cannot but mean, '*measuring speech, 'syllable' or 'letter*. Besides rules like 'स्वरितेनाधिकारः' 1. 3. 11. become meaningless With the discovery of writing in Mohenjodaro, Harappa, Hosangabad, Hyderabad-potteries, these views are summarily dismissed.

But 'काञ्चीवाची तालव्य-शकारवान्। जिह्वावाची तु दन्त्य-सकारवान् (BD) इत्येषा व्यवस्था भूरि-प्रयोगाऽभिप्रायेण उक्ता। वस्तुतस्तु तालव्य-शकारवान् रशना-शब्दोऽपि 'काञ्च्यां' जिह्वायांच, तथा दन्त्य-सकारवान् रसना शब्दोऽपि अर्थद्वये बोध्यः' — T. Kings are often described as husbands of the sea-girt earth. Hence according to *H* 'सागरमेखला' is a synonym of पृथिवी । Cf. 'रत्नाऽनुविद्धाऽर्णव-मेखलायाः दिशः सपत्नी भव दक्षिणस्याः'—*Ra. VI.* 63.

XV. 83;* R reads '**०वसना**' । This idea, though not so common as the previous one, is not at all rare. H has '**सागराम्बरा**' as a synonym for 'पृथिवी' which *Kāli* has used in Ra. Cf.

 **109.—1. नाट्येन परिहरति**— S'ak avoids the kiss of theking. This is necessary as the rules of dramaturgy do not allowkissing on the stage. Read "दन्तच्छेद्यं नखच्छेद्यम् अन्यत् व्रीडाकरञ्च यत्।शयनाऽधर-पानादि नगराद्यवरोधनम्॥ स्नानानुलेपने चैभिर्वर्जितो नातिविस्तरः"—SD.

According to poetic convention they are doomed topass the night separated, on account of an imprecation pronouncedupon them by Rāma whom they had taunted while he wasbewailing for Sītā. The following synonyms are proofs of theirconstancy and connubial affection. 'भूरिप्रेमा। द्वन्द्वचारी। रात्रिविश्लेषगामी'—Kalpa ; Ra. VIII. 56; MD. 82 3. **आमन्त्रयस्व**— आ+मन्त्र means to 'bid farewell'. Cf. 'लताभगिनीं वनज्योत्स्नाम् आमन्दविष्ये' — S'ak. IV. 'ते हिमालय-



मामन्त्र्य'— Ku. VI. 94. Sometimes it means simply 'to say'. Vide BK. IX. 98. 111n. 4.

Meanwhile get (yourself) concealed behind the branches.

** राजा— तथा** (आत्मानमावृत्य तिष्ठति)।

 King—All right. (Stands hiding himself).

 **सख्यौ—इदो इदो अज्जा गोदमी** \[ इत इत आर्या गौतमी\]।

 Friends—This way, venerable Gautamī, this way.

 Gautamī (Going up to S'akuntalā)—My child, do your limbshave their sufferings abated? (This said, touches her body).

anxiety. Regretfully separated, why is now this thy fever? (After a few steps, stopping—Aloud) O bower of creepers! thesoother of (my) suffering! (I) bid you farewell, yet (hoping)again to enjoy (thee). (Exit S'akuntalā sorrowfully along with others).

** 114n.—1. कुसुमाऽवचयं**—अव+चि+अच् भावे = अवचयःculling.But the formation of this word is a grammatical irregularity accordingto Pāṇini. For, by 'हस्ताऽऽदाने चेः अस्तेये' 3.3.40 'घञ्' comes after'चि', causing 'वृद्धि' of the radical vowel, when something is takenby the hand, excepting the cases of stealth (अस्तेये)। 'चयनीय-पदार्थस्यहस्त-चयनार्थे, चि-धातोः परः, कर्तृभिन्न-वाच्ये घञ्-प्रत्ययः स्यात्, न चेत् तत् चयनंचौर्यंभवति'— Prabhā. Hence the regular form is **'अवचाय'** and not 'अवचय'। Cf. 'अविरत-कुसुमाऽ**वचाय**-खेदात्–S'PB VII, 71; 'अन्यत्र यूयं कुसुमाऽ**वचायं**कुरुध्वम् अत्र अस्मि करोमि मुख्यः' —MB. VM opines that the forms **'अवचय'**and **'अवतर'** are used by the fools. Cf. 'अवताराऽवचाय-शब्दयोः दीर्घ-व्यत्यासोबालानाम्'—KSV. 2. 40 ; HD in his PM first of all, justifies the uses of अच् thus— 'हस्तादाने इति किम ? वृक्ष-शिखरे पुष्प–प्रचयंकरोति,' i. e.when the flowers are out of reach and are culled not directly withhands but by means of a hook. Later grammarians follow HD(SK. 3212.) 'हस्तचयने किम् ? वृक्षाग्रस्थितानां फलानां यष्ट्या प्रचयंकरोति'—Prabhā. R however remarks thus—'As the flowers were out of reach,they were culled by climbing the tree' but this is not at all befittingyoung girls like Anasūya and Priyamvadā. Kāli has already used'अवचय' in Mālā. Cf. 'वयस्य एषा कुसुमावचय-व्यग्र-**हस्ता** सख्यास्ते इरावत्याःपरिचारिका चन्द्रिका समागच्छति'—Act. IV, and there 'हस्त' has been explicitlyused which fact also totally demolishes the previous arguments.



In fact it is an archaic form frequently used by old writers. Cf. 'तया सह पुष्पावचयं ग्रथनं' &c.—KS. II. 3.5; 'यावदहमपि कुसुमावचयं करोमि'—SV. IV ;also 'कुसुमावचयंनाटयति'— Rat. I; 'पुष्पावचयव्यग्रा'— UC. III.2. **अभिनयन्त्यौ**— is preferable to नाटयन्त्यौ(R) as a little after wehave 'अनसूया —ननु प्रियसख्याः शकुन्तलायाःसौभाग्य-देवता अर्चनीया। प्रियंवदा— युज्यते। (तदेव **कर्माभिनयतः**)'। 3. **गान्धर्वेण**—108n. 3. 4. **निर्वृत्तकल्याणा &c**.—निर्+ वृत् (वर्तने) + क्त कर्तरि = निर्वृत्तमम performed. 'सिद्धेनिर्वृत्त-निष्पन्नौ'–AK; Rām. I.18.1. निर्वृतम्—(निर + वृ+ क्त कर्तरि )means 'satisfied'. Cf. 'निर्वृते स्वः— III. Supra ; Ra. XII. 65 ; XI. 38.MK. VIII. 7. 'कल्यं' नीरूजत्वम् (absence of disease) आणयति इति अण् (3.2.1)or 'कल्ये' प्रभातकाले अण्यते (अण शब्दे इति घञ्—BhD) =**कल्याणं—** Peoplegenerally enquire about one's health or good luck when they meet in themorning. **भर्तृ-गामिनी**— 'न' is not changed into 'ण' by 'कुमति च' 8.4.12. Vide 127n, 6. 5. **इष्टिं**— यज् + क्तिन् कर्मणि = इष्टिःsacrifice ( य = इ'वचि-स्वपि-यजादीनां किति' 6. 1. 15.). 6. **अद्य ऋषिभिर्विसृष्टः&c.**— Anasūya rightly thinks that the king may forget Ś'ak when he willbe amidst the inmates of his royal seraglio, This is but a repetitionof her apprehension which she had already expressed in the last act.Cf. 'वयस्य, बहु वल्लभा राजानः श्रूयन्ते। यथा आवयोः प्रियसखी बन्धुजन-शोचनीया न भवतितथा निर्वाहय'—p. 271. **इतोगतं वृत्तान्तम्—** Incidents that transpired!here. **स्मरति**= स्मरिष्यति, 'वर्तमान-सामीप्ये वर्तमानवद्वा' 3. 3. 131; **वृत्तान्तं—**no षष्ठी with स्मरति by 'अधीगर्थदयेशां कर्मणि' 2. 3. 52 as the idea of शेषत्वis absent. Vide 27n. 3.

** Remark.**—According to R **'गर्भसन्धि'** begins from the beginningof the fourth act and extends to the middle of the fifth act. (S'1.19)



(Com.) But an authority like VK considers it to be acase of**विमर्षसन्धि**— (Peripateia) 'यत्रमुख्य-फलोपाय उद्भिन्नः
गर्भतोऽधिकः।शापाद्यःसान्तरायश्च स विमर्ष इति स्मृतः। यथा शाकुन्तले चतुर्थाङ्कादौ'अनसूया— पिअंवदे! जइविगन्धव्वेण \* \* \* चिन्तणिज्जं' इत्यत आरभ्य सप्तमाङ्को-पक्षिप्तात् शकुन्तला-प्रत्यभिज्ञानात्प्रागर्थ- सञ्चयः शकुन्तला-विस्मरण रुप-विघ्नालिङ्गितः'— SD. VI; (because themeans of gaining the end are hindered by the imprecationof Durbāsā). According to this view प्रतिमुख-सन्धि seems to end with  
'स्निग्धजनसंविभक्तंहि दुःखं सह्यवेदनंभवति'—P. 242; and गर्भसन्धि' beginswith Act. III. 9 and extends up to the close of the same act.

** प्रियंवदा— एत्थ दाव वीसद्धा होहि** \[अत्र तावत् विस्रव्धा भव \]। **ण हितादिसा आकिदि-विसेसा गुण-विरोहिणो होन्ति। किन्दु तादो दाणिंइमं वुत्तन्तं सुणिअ ण आणे किं पडिबज्जिस्सदित्ति** \[न हि तादृशा आकृति-विशेषा गुण-विरोधिनी भवन्ति। किन्तु तात इदानीमिमं वृत्तान्तं श्रुत्वा न जाने किं प्रतिपत्स्यते इति \]।

 Priyaṁvadā—In this, now be trusting. Never are such notedforms opposed to worth. But (I ) cannot say what father (Kaṇva)will do now, on hearing of this affair.

** अनसूया—जहअहं देक्खामि, तह तस्म अणुमदं भवे**\[ यथा अहं पश्यामि तथा तम्य अनुमतंभवेत्।\]

**प्रियंवदा— एवस्मेदं।** (पुष्पभाजनं विलोक्य) **—सहि! अवइदाइं बलि-कम्म-पज्जत्ताइं कुसुमाइं** \[ एवमेतत्। सखि ! अवचितानि बलि-कर्म-प्रर्याप्तानि कुसुमानि \]। Priyaṁvadā—So it is. (Looking at the flower basket) Friend! flowers sufficient for the rite of worship have been culled.

** अनसूया— णं पिअसहीए सउन्दलाए सोहग्ग-देवआ अच्चणीआ** \[ ननु प्रियसख्याः शकुन्तलायाः सौभाग्य-देवता अर्चनीया \] । Anasūyā— But the (guardian) deity of S'akuntalā's fortune (is) also to be propitiated.

** प्रियंवदा— जुज्जदि** (युज्यते) । (तदेव कर्माभिनयतः)।

 Priyaṁvadā—Just so. ( Both gesticulate the same act.)

 (नेपथ्ये)— **अयमहं भोः,** (In the post scenium) — It is I, ho there !

** अनसूया** (कर्णं दत्त्वा) — **सहि! अदिधौणं विअ णिवेदिदं** \[सखि! अतिथीनामिव निवेदितम्\]। Anasūyā (Leaning her ear) — Friend! the voice is like that of a (reuered) guest.

In thisparticular case Duṣyanta has both, so there is no reason why themarriage should not be approved of by the superiors. 4.**अप्रयासेन**—implies 'entire absence of exertion'. Cf.

 **116n.—1. श्रद्य पुनः &c.—** Priyaṁvadā utters this speechaside to herself. This is necessary. For, hearing the call of theguest, Anasūyā says to Priyaṁvadā— 'Friend, a guest has come, let'sgo'. Next Priyaṁvadā replies—'S'ak is in the cottage. There isno need of hurry.' But simultaneously with this speech she*remembers* (आम्) that the king has left the hermitage that verythat day and consequently she must be sad and pensive or absentminded and may not do the needful. Still at one breath Priyaṁvadādoes not like to contradict her previous remark. Hence the speech isaside. (R; M; Cappeller). 2.**भवतु &c.**—भवतु (अव्यय) tones downthe remark of Priyaṁvadā, i. e. 'ननु उटजे सन्निहिता शकुन्तला'। The latterspeech being uttered *aside*, is not heard by Anasūyā who opines— "The call has come surely from an honoured guest, ( अतिथीनांनिवेदितम्—*Mark the plural number*) so we should no longer tarry formore flowers entirely depending upon Śak. We must immediatelyrepair to the cottage." This is the force of 'भवतु' (24n. 8.) 3.**आः**—Implies anger. Cf. 'आःक एष मयि स्थिते चन्द्रगुप्तमभिभवितुमिच्छति' ?

 **Remark**— Durbāsā's curse in PP is found as follows—'यं तंचिन्तयसे बाले मानसाऽनन्यवृत्तिना। विस्मरिष्यति स त्वां वै अतिथौ मौनशालिनीम्'।Note that 'marriage ceremony', 'anathematisation', &c. areprohibited on the stage, but this prohibition holds good in allplaces save विष्कम्भक ; for otherwise the definition of विमर्षसन्धि becomesmeaningless. \[114n.

IV.* 'अग्रपाद-स्थिता'—191n. 8. Our poet skillfullymakes Priyaṁvadā stumble and does not allow her to go away forpreparing अर्घोदक (33n. 3), but he engages her in collecting flowers.This is necessary as the rules of dramaturgy do not allow the stage to be kept devoid of all the actors. Hence she must stay there,until Anasūyā comes and removes the anxiety of the audience asto the imprecation of Durbāsās. According to R this stumblingprognosticates future calamity i. e. Durbāsā's refusal of coming back.

 **Remark**—Anasūyā as we have seen is always considerate,cautious, and helpful to S'ak. When everybody was stunned by thesudden presence of the king, she was first to recover self-possessionto make arrangement for king's reception. She keeps the *kes'ara*—garland (*infra*), and herself negotiates with the king aboutthe future happiness of S'ak. So in a vital affair like the curse ofDurbāsā, it is quite natural that our poet should send Anasūyā



(the *namesake* of the sage's mother) to pacify the choleric Durbāsās.Therefore the allotment of speech in B is preferable. 33n. 2, 3.

 4. **पुष्पोच्चयं**—Here the flowers are collected with hands, still'घञ्' is not available (Vide 114n. 1) owing to the Vārt. 'उच्चयस्यप्रतिषेधो वक्तव्यः'—KV. 3. 3. 40. But this *Vārt* is spurious as it is not found in the MBh. Hence 'उच्चय' like 'अवचय' is also a *poetic licence*."हस्तादाने चेरस्तेये, इति घञ् विषयत्वात् कवीनामयंप्रामादिकः प्रयोग इति वल्लभदेबः"—*MN on Ku. III. 61.*

 Anasūyā—When he refused to come back, (*he*) was thus imploredby me by falling on his feet—'O omniscient one! considering that itis the first offence of one who is like (*your*) daughter, (*and is*)ignorant of the power of penance, (*this*) single fault has to becondoned by Your Holiness.'

 **प्रियंवदा—तदो तदो** \[ततस्ततः\]। Anasūyā—What, what next?

'अनाविष्कृत-दानराजिः'—Ra. II. 7.Here is a rhetorical difficulty. For 'कृ' being 'सकर्मक,' 'क्त' is in the*passive voice*, but the previous sentence is in the *active voice*, thus प्रक्रम-भङ्ग-दोष arises. Against this we can say (i) here 'कृ' is used*intransitively* by the dictum— 'धातोःअर्थान्तरेवृत्तेः धात्वर्थेनीपसंग्रहात्। प्रसिद्धेः अविवक्षातः कर्मणोऽकर्मिका क्रिया'—*Qtd MN on Ki. I. 1; SK. 2701*.Hence 'क्त' comes in the active voice (3. 4. 72) ; or say 'आादिकर्मणिक्तः, कर्तरि च' 3. 4. 72 इति कर्तरि क्तः॥ "The usual sign of such 'क्त' (*i. e*. प्र)



is not absolutely *necessary*."Cf. 'स कटंप्र-कृतः, कर्तुम् आरब्धवान् इत्यर्थः। अत्रप्र-शब्दः आदि-कर्म- द्योतकः। कदाचित् प्र-शब्दाऽभावेऽपि आदि-कर्म-प्रयोगःदृश्यते। यथाधातवः पठिताः। धातुपाठ-सूत्र-लोकागम-स्थिता इत्यर्थः। विप्र ओदनं भुक्तः'—*Prabhā.under 3. 4. 72*. But even then प्रक्रमभङ्गदोष is not totally avoided.(Com.). The followers of M take the whole as a compound-word(आविष्कृता-रूण-पुरःसरः) which is explained thus—आविष्कृतः अरुणः आविष्कृतारुणः।सः पुरःसरः यस्य तथाभूतः अर्कः एकतःआस्ते। But this reading is *rejected*,as in this explantion 'व्यसन' and उदय are not synchronal (युगपत्).For a similar idea, Cf. "अरुण इव पुरःसरः रविं पवन इवातिजवो जलागमम्। शुभम शुभमथापि वा नृृणां कथयति पूर्वनिदर्शनोदयः'—HC. IV. 4. **अरुण**—Is theeldest son of 'विनता' and brother of '*Garuḍa*'. विनता untimely hatchedthe egg and so अरुण was born with defective limbs (*i. e. withoutthighs*). Hence he is also called 'अनूरु'। "जनयामास । पुत्रौ द्वावरुणं गरुड़न्तथा॥ विकला- ङ्गोऽरुणस्तत्र भास्करस्य पुरुःसरः'—Mahā. 'गतंतिरश्चीनम्अनूरुसारथेः'—S'PB.

Note that shedoes not say शाट्यम् or use some such expression. An आर्य is one whodoes his duty, '*who is as good as his word*' (Vide 3n. 1).

Agni at the request of God, took inhimself the lustre of S'iva but later on being unable to brook the sulphuric action of तेजस्, he first of all entered into water to allaythe terrible heat. He however was reported to the Gods by a frogwho was much troubled by the intense heat generated by the presenceof Agni. \["रसातलतले देवा वसत्यग्निरिति प्रभो। सन्तापादिह संप्राप्तः पावकप्रभवादहम्' २४\]।

 The fire, then, fled inside the Aśvatha tree, and cursed the frogto be bereft of the sense of taste. His new abode also was reportedto by an *elephant*, who was also similarly cursed to have his tongueturned back. \['प्रतीपा भवतां जिह्वा भवित्रीति भृगुद्वह', ३६।\] Next Agnientered into the S'ami tree but this time also his presence wasmade known to the gods by a *parrot* as a consequence of which itlost its power of speech by the malison of Agni.

'गम्यादयश्च प्रयोगतः ज्ञेयाः'—T. The city ofहस्तिनापुरम् \[*according to HV & Purāṅas*; 'हस्तिनपुरम्,' 'हस्तिनीपुरम्'—H.'हास्तिनपुरम्'—Mahā\] was founded by Hastī, the 7th king fromDuṣyanta (दुष्यन्त\> भरत\> वितथ\> मन्यु\>बृहदिषु\> सुहोत्र\> हस्ती)। —HV. Pitṛkalpa. Ch. 20; (VaP. Ch. 99; 165 & VP. IV. Ch. 18.)Mahā I. 94 makes हस्ती *the great-grand-son of Bharata* (दुष्यन्त-भरत-भूमन्यु-सुहोत्र-हस्ती)। Thus the mention of हस्तिनापुरम् before the birthof the future generations of Duṣyanta, gives rise to *anachronism*. Ourpoet perhaps has used this name as it was quite wellknown to thepeople of his time. This compound-word involves *knotty* points of णत्वविधि। The उत्तरपद 'गामिन्' contains a letter of**कवर्ग**, followed by 'र' in the पूर्वपद, therefore 'न' of the last membermust be changed into *cerebral* ण by 'कुमति च' 8. 4. 13; 1056. But when *Pāṇini himself uses dental* 'न' in **'प्रष्ठोऽग्र-गामिनि'** 8.3.92,the inference is this that 'गामिन्' at the final of a compoundis an *exception* to the rule "कुमति च"। In that case '०गामिन्' maybe considered as belonging to क्षुभ्नादि class, although it is notactually mentioned in that list. For क्षुभ्नादि in आकृतिगण(*Com*.). Later grammarians, lexicographers and classical



writers approve of this view. 'कथ' **प्र-पक्वानि** फलानि, **\* \* \*** **अग्रगामिनी?क्षुभ्नादित्वात्'**—*Prabhā*. P. 561.

(16 times) ; **स्वर्ग-गामिनः**(31 times). *Puruṣottama**Deva*, author of त्रिकाण्डशेष, makes 'सागर-गामिनी' a synonym for 'नदी'which again has been used by our poet. Cf. 'महीधरं मार्गवशादुपेतंस्रोतोवहा **सागर-गामिनीव"**—Ra. VI. 52. where, MN has **"सागर-गामिनी** सागरगन्त्री"। **'सेनाग्र-गामिनः'**—*Rām*. V. 48.7; **'निरय-गामिनः'**—17, 36; **'शीघ्र-गामिनः'**—*I.11. 24. Rājanirghaṇṭa* gives **'सागर-गामिनी'** a synonym for 'सूक्ष्मैला'। *Goicandra* in his संक्षिप्तसारव्याकरण justifies the **dental न** by placing 'गामिन्' (*in the* उत्तरपद) in theयुवादि list. \[Cf. 'युवादेर्न'—*Vārt*. 1055.\] Only VM holds a different*view*, for VM cites 'वृष-गामिणौ' as an example of 'कुमति च'। Vide KV*under* 8.4. 13. But this is चिन्त्याः for in शिष्टप्रयोग's never 'ण' is metwith in such cases. Besides most grammarians are against 'ण'।At best we can somehow, justify 'ण' by having recourse to "ज्ञापक-सिद्धं नसर्वत्र"—T on 600, but dental न is undoubtedly better. Curiously enoughProf. G retains the reading 'शकुन्तला अनुरूपभर्तृ गामिनी' (Act. IV. P. 98.)with *dental* 'न', though in this connection he remarks "The reading



'हस्तिनापुर-गामिनः' found in almost all the printed texts is incorrect."7. **शब्दाय्यन्ते**—शब्दंकरोति इति 'शब्दायते' with क्यङ् by 'शब्दवैर-कलहाऽभ्र-कखमेघेभ्यः करणे' 3. 1. 17; 2613. Next शब्दाय (नामधातु) + णिच् +लट् अन्तेकर्मणि=शब्दाय्यन्ते made to respond.

 **135n.—1. भगिन्याः—**This is the usual address. 37n. 2. For६ष्ठी17n. 5. (*Com*.) 2. **आदेशय**= दर्शय। अनेकार्थत्वात् धातूनाम्। This is frequently used in dramas in this sense. Cf. 'भवान् प्रमोदमार्गम् आदेशयतु'—*Vik.III*. 'वेत्रवति, अग्निशरणमार्गम् आदेशय'—Act. V. p. 19 ; p. 93. **भो** **भोः**—51n. 1.3. **पातुंन** **प्रथमं &c.**—The idea is that she did never drink wateronly before watering the trees *first time* in the morning, for wecannot conceive of her doing like this on every occasion, she wasthirsty. **व्यवस्यति**—Śak. I. 17. 4. **युष्मास्वपीतेषु**—As पा is *transitive*,it cannot take क्त in the *active voice*. But 'पा + क्त' in the passivevoice will mean *'which is drunk'* but the trees cannot be drunk like



water. This difficulty is removed thus:—(i) पा + क्त भावे=पीतम्पानम्(drinking—'कृदभिहितो भावो द्रव्यवत् प्रकाशते')।Next पीतम् + मत्वर्थेअच् \['अर्श आदिभ्यः अच् 5. 2. 127\] = पीतःwho has his drinking (*finished*).Read "अकारो मत्वर्थीयः। विभक्तम् एषाम् अस्ति इति विभक्ताः। पीतम् एषाम् अस्तिइति पीताः। भुक्तम् एषाम् अस्ति इति भुक्ताः इति सर्वत्र"—*MBh*. (ii) पीत standsfor पीतजल, the उत्तरपद (जल) has been dropped as it is easilyunderstood. Cf. 'उत्तरपद-लोपः अत्र द्रष्टव्यः। विभक्त-धनाः विभक्ताः, पीतो- दकाःपीताः'—*Ibid*. 'गम्यमानस्य अप्रयोग एव लोपोऽभिमतः'—KT. (iii) पीत by उपाचार(*transference of epithets*) means पीतजल, i. e. here the quality of theobject is transferred to the agent. 'विभक्ताः भ्रातरः' इत्यत्र च धनस्य यत् विभक्तत्वंतत् भ्रातृषु उपचर्यते। पीताः गावः, इत्यत्रापि उदकस्य पीतत्वं गोषु आरोप्यते। भुक्ताःब्राह्मणाः, इत्यत्र अन्नस्य भुक्तत्वं ब्राह्मणेषु उपचर्यते'—KT. Paternal wealth isdivided among the brothers, but the owners of the property, i.e.brothers are consequently said to be divided. Similarly water isdrunk but the agent of drinking is, by a *periphrastic* way, said to bedrunk. (iv) Though transitive, पा can be used intransitively.\[121n. 3\]. Hence कर्तरि क्तः। "सकर्मकादपि अविवक्षिते कर्मणि क्तः। 'आशितःकर्ता' ६।१।२०७ इत्यादौ यथा"—MN on 'विदितः' in Ki. I. 1. 'अशेः अयम् आङ्पूर्वात् अविवक्षिते कर्मणि कर्तरि क्तः'—KV. Pāṇini himself has used 'कर्तरिक्त' after 'आा + अश’ which is transitive. 5. **आद्ये वः कुसुम-प्रसूति &c.**—For 'joy caused by the first show of flowers', Cf. 'आत्मसंवर्धित-लता-**प्रथम**-कुसुम-निर्गम-निवेदनागताम् उद्यानपालीम् अशेषा-भरणदानेन सम्मानयन्तीम्—Kād. P. 686.

 **Remark**—According to GPS' Kāli is *indebted* to the followingŚloka of Bhāsa:—"यस्यां न प्रिय-मण्डनापि महिषीदेवस्य मन्दोदरी। स्नेहात् लुम्पतिपल्लवान् न च पुर्नवीजन्ति यस्यां भयात्॥ वीजन्तो मलयानिला अपि करैरस्पृष्टबालद्रुमा।सेयं शक्ररिपोः अशोक-वनिका भग्नेति विज्ञाप्यताम्॥—*Aviṣeka. III. 1.*



 **6. कोकिलरवं &c.**—The note of cuckoo is made by someof the actors who are very expert in imitating any kind of sounds.Read. "एषा रङ्ग-प्रवेशेन कलानां चैव शिक्षया। स्वरान्तरेण दक्षा हि व्याहर्तुं तन्नमुच्यताम्"—*Cārudatta*. I. 24. 7. **वन-वास-बन्धुभिः &c**.—Cf. 'यत्र द्रुमा अपि।बन्धवो मे'—UC. III. 18. 'तरुभिः' does not take **षष्ठी**by "क्तस्य च वर्तमाने”2. 3. 67, as 'क्त' in 'अनुमत' &c has been used in the passive voice(अतीते)। "यदा वर्तमाने क्तः, तदा षष्ठी।समास-निषेधश्च। यदा तु भूते क्तः, तदाकर्तरि तृतीया। यथा "पूजितः यः सुरासुरैः' इति। तस्याः'कर्तृ' करणे कृता बहुलम् (३।२।३२)इति समासः। न च तक्र-कौण्डिन्य-न्यायात् 'वर्तमाने क्तः' इह 'भूते क्तः' बाधते इति वाच्यम्।"तेन" इत्यधिकारे 'उपज्ञाते' (४।३।११५) इति निर्देशेन अबाध-ज्ञापनात्।न च ज्ञानार्थ-मात्र-विषयकम्ज्ञापकम्। उदाहृत-प्रयोगाऽनुरोधेन सामान्यविषयकत्वस्यैव न्याय्यत्वात्"—*Maitreya Rakṣita* (अनुन्यास)। The gist is :—*Pāṇini* himselfconnects the Sūtra "उपज्ञाते" with "तेन” \["तेन इत्येव। पाणिनि उपज्ञातंपाणिनीयम्"—BD\], therefore मति, बुद्धि and पूजार्थक roots will also takeक्त-प्रत्यय in the *past tense* and hence their subjects may take **तृतीया** विभक्ति। This is the view of BD and नव्याऽः But HD and KT areagainst this view. "स्वादेवं यदि भूते क्तः लभ्यः।न। नाप्राप्ते तस्मिन् आरभ्यमाणोवर्तमाने क्तः तस्य वाधको भवति। एवञ्च 'पूजितः यः'सुरैसुरारित्यचि- कित्स्योऽपशब्दः।'त्वयाज्ञातो', 'मया ज्ञात' इति तु भवत्येव्य। 'तेन' इत्यधिकारे 'उपज्ञाते' इति निर्देशात्"—*PM. on 2, 2. 12. Also Bhāṣya Pradīpa on 3. 2. 118.* Hence accordingto them तृतीया with ज्ञानार्थक roots may be allowed, but तृतीया withइच्छार्थक or पूजार्थक roots is absolutely *wrong*.Therefore the following uses are erroneous:—'अनुप्रासधिया गौरैस्तदिष्टं बन्धगौरवात्'—KA. 'कलहं राममहितः कृतवान्'—BK. X. 2. 'स पूण्यकर्मा भूवि पूजितः नृपैः'—S's. 8. **परभृत**—The cuckoo is so termed because the female ones are supposed  




to keep their eggs in the nests of crows which hatch them. Thecock-koil sits himself on a prominent part and lifts up his voiceand shouts aloud and very soon attracts the attention of the ownerof the nest (i. e. crows) who rush out to attack and chase him away.Now comes the chance of his wife who forthwith nips in to deposither egg'—*D. D. Cunnigham. (Indian Friends and Acquaintancespp. 64-65*). 'परभृत इव नीड़ेरक्षितः वायसीभिः'—MK. VII. 3. 'अन्यैः द्विजैःपरभृताखलु पोषयन्ति'—S'ak. V. 22 ; Ra. IX. 43 ; Ku. VI. 2. Mark that thecrow is called 'परभृत्' (पर विभर्ति। क्किप्)। **कल** (*adj*) means 'sweet.' **०विरुतं कलं**—sweet warblings of the cuckoo. Cf. 'कलम् अन्यभृतासुभाषितम्, कलहंसीषु मदालसंगतम्'—Ra. VIII. 59.

 **149n.—1. चिराय**—The modern *philologists* opine that the अव्ययऽwere originally *declinable* words. This is evident from the following forms still in vogue—चिरम् (Ra. III. 35) चिरेण (Ra. V. 64) चिराय (Ra. XIV. 59) चिरात्—(Ra. III. 26 ; S'ak. V. 18) चिरस्य (AK. & H. ; Sak. V. 15)। चिरे (७मी) —RM. 'चिरे कुर्यात्'—S'ata-



patha Brāhmana. 'अन्तरम्' (२या) 'अन्तरेण' (३या), 'कृते', 'अर्थ', स्थाने (७मी) साक्षात् (५मी) &c, **2**. • **मही- सपत्नी**—The earth is frequently considered to be a 'सपत्नी' by our poet. Cf. "रत्नाऽनुविद्धाऽर्णवमेखलायाः दिशःसपत्नीभव दक्षिणस्याः”—Ra. *VII. 63*. **चतुरन्त &c**.—Sak. III. 17 ; Ra. II. 1 ; “चतुरन्तां महींभुक्का"— Rām. II. 104. 12, **3**. **दौष्यन्तिम्**—*Tri-kāndasesa* has 'दौष्मन्तिम्' (B). Vide Mahā. Dronā. 681. This indirect reference is necessary, as an issue cannot be named until it is born, **4**. **अप्रतिरथं**—One who has no rival (रथः = रथिकः or रथौ), or one whose car is unchecked. (*Com*). **5**. **निवेश्य**—"नि+वि‍श् +णिच्” may mean (i) 'To paint,' Cf. 'चित्रे निवेश्य'—S'ak. II. 19. *Mālā* ; III. 11. (ii) '*to encamp*' (*as an army*). Ra. V. 42 ; XVI 37. (iii) "*to install on the throne*". Cf. 'स निवेश्य कुशावत्यां रिपुनागाङ्कुशंकुशम्'—Ra. XV. 97 ; (iv) “to get oneself married". Cf. "तान्निवेश्य चतुरोपि तव सः'—Ra. XI. 57. (Com.) Commenting on “अहञ्चापि अनिविष्टो वै भीमसेनश्च पाण्डवः। पार्थेन विजिता चैषा रत्नभूता सुता तव'—Mahā. ch. 195. 24. Nilakantha remarks 'अनिविष्टःअकृत-विवाहः'। Here the fourth sense is approved by the commentator K, while R prefers the third one, but as the idea of installation can be inferred from तदर्पित-कुटुम्ब-भरेण, the fourth sense seems to be preferable. **6**. **भर्त्रा तदर्पित &c**— 248n. 1. A house-holder is to retire to a hermitage to observe 'a' with or without his wife in his old age. 'Cf. 'पुत्रेषु भार्यां निक्षिप्य वनं गच्छेत् सहैव वा'—GP.

 **150n.—1**. **परिहीयते**—'परि+हा' means '*to leave*', hence here '*to pass away*'. Cf. ‘विभावरीपरिहीणा'—*BK. K. XIII*. ’उर्वशी नकिमपि परिहीयते'—*Vik. III ; MS. XIII. 92 ; 4n. 1*. **2**. **उपरुध्यते मेतपोऽनुष्ठानम्**—'उपरुध्यते **मे**आश्रमवास धर्मः'—*Vik. V*.'सङ्कटा ह्याहिताग्नीनां प्रत्यवायैः गृहस्थता'—*UC. 1. 8* The quotation from Vik proves the genuineness of 'मे' (B). **मम कृते**—139n. 1. **3**. **शममेष्यति** &c. —An extremely *pathetic* stanza. It is considered to be one of the four best ślokas. Kāśyapa is so deeply moved that he is about to shed tears but perhaps considering that act to be inauspicious \[Cf. 'गुरुशोकाः कथमपि मा रुदन् माङ्गलिकाः'—*BK. I. 27*.\], he somehow checks them and his latent tears of grief are made patent by a deep sigh. \[निश्वस्य\]। **4. उटज-द्वारि**—(Ra. I. 50.) is signifiant. Because the grains will germinate at the entrance of the cottage, so these will always re-mind him of Sak. M opines that **नीवार-बलिं** has a reference to भूतयज्ञ \[*MS, TV. 21 ; III. 80-87, 90, 92, 117, 121*\]. बलि therein is a



cooked food \['प्रहुतो भौतिकः बलिः'—*MS. VI. 74*.\]But *germination is not possible from cooked rice*. Better take it torefer to rice-grains which are *usually* thrown by hermit girls as a *present* \[i. e. ford ; बलि = उपहार\] to the beasts and birds.Those that might escape being partaken of, will naturally germinate. Cf. 'यासां बलिः सपदि मद्गृहदेहलीनां, हंसैश्च सारसगणैश्च विभक्तपुष्पः। तास्वेव पूर्व-बलिरूढयवाङ्कुरासुबीजाञ्जलिः। पतित कीटमुखावलीढ़ः”—

*Cārudatta 1. 2*. “आकीर्णमृषीपत्नीनाम् उटजहार-रोधिभिः अपत्यैरिव नीवारभागधेयोचितैः मृगैः”—

*Ra. I. 50 ; MK. I. 9 ; JH. V. 3*.

 **Remark**.—According to HS the sloka contains समाप्तपुनरात्तता-दोष (48n. 7.) in the first line i. c. 'शममेष्यति मे शोकः कथम्' seems to be a complete sentence ; Read—

इत्यनेन वाक्यसमाप्तावपि पुनस्तदन्तर्गतस्य 'मम' इत्यस्य विशेषणतया 'त्वया रचितपूर्वम्' इत्यारभ्य द्वितीयार्धस्य पुनरात्तत्वात् समाप्तपुनरात्तता दोषः। स च “निवर्तिष्यते शोकः” इति प्रथमचरण-पाठेन, 'नीवारबलिं पश्यतो मे” इति चतुर्थचरण-पाठेन च समाधेयः। तादृशपाठे तु 'मे' इति विशेष्यस्यापि पुनरात्तत्वात् नोक्तदोषः। समाप्त-वाक्यान्तर्गतस्य कस्यचिद्विशेषणतयैव पुनरुपादाने तद्दोषाङ्गीकारात्।

 **काश्यपः** (सनिःश्वासम्)—**अनसूये ! गतवती वां सहचारिणी। निगृह्य शोकम् अनुगच्छ माम्।** (सर्वे प्रस्थिताः)।

Sakuntala being sent to (*her*) husband's home, (*natural*) serenity of mind has been achieved now.For—Verily a daughter (*is*) another's property.

(middle). **5**. **प्रत्यर्पित-न्यासः—**न्यासः(*Ram. VI. 127. 54. Ra. XII.18.*)=*a deposit*' "पुमान् उपनिधिर्न्यासःप्रतिदानंतदर्पणम्"। To keep up another's deposit is a very difficult task, and perfect ease cannot be had until it has been returned to its owner. S'ak was also, as it were, a trust (न्यासः) to Kaņva (Cf. 'विटः—काणेली-मातः, वसन्तसेना तव हस्ते न्यासः—*MK. VIII*.) and now that she has been sent back to Duşyanta, he is feeling perfect satisfaction.

 **Remark :—**For a similar idea cf. "सुखमर्थोभवेत् दातुं सुखं प्राणाः सुखंतपः। सुखमन्यद् भवेत् सर्वं दुःखं न्यासस्य रक्षणम्॥—*SV. I. 10*. Our poet here through the mouth of Kāśyapa, gives vent to his own view about the proper nurturing of girls. According to him, until betrothal, a daughter seems to be looked upon with kneener affection and greater attention than a male issue.

 **Time-analysis of Act IV**—About three weeks' interval separates the विष्कम्भकof this act, from the third. In the interim the Gandharva marriage has been performed and Śak has duly conceived. The prelude begins a bit late in the morning, when Anasūya and Priyamvadā are culling flowers for worship and the king has left the hermitage on that very day early in the morning ("अद्य स राजर्षिःइष्टिं परिसमाप्य &c. ; "अद्य पुनः हृदयेनासन्निहिता”)। The month is probably the later part of ज्यैष्ठ, or the first part of Āşaḍha. The *act proper* begins early in the morning ”हन्त प्रभातम्’॥'अन्तर्हिते शशिनि'॥ प्रतिबुद्ध्यापि किं करिष्यामि’\] and the time is somewhere near the full-moon day when moon and the sun are synchronously visible \['तेजोद्वयस्य युगपत्व्यसनोदयाभ्याम्'\]। *A long time* intervenes between the main scenes and the prelude 'एतावतःकालस्य लेखमात्रमपि' &c. ; 'दुष्करमहंकरोमि'\]।



S'ak has shown *visible sign of pregnancy* ('दुष्यन्तपरिणीताम्आपन्नसत्वाम्') and hence it must be at least five *months* after the Gāndharva marriage. *According* to PP S'ak is now in the *seventh* month of her pregnancy. \[*124n. 4.*\]. Hence the rainy season is past \['अपसृत-पाण्डुपत्रा) and the main scene commences in the autumn. (Cf. 'प्रवृत्तनृत्यं बर्हिणाम्'—RS *II. 6*; 'परित्यक्तनर्तना मयूराः'—

'शिरसि वकुलमालाम्'—

*RS. II. 14* ; 'कालान्तरक्षमा केशरमालिका'—

IV\. On the *very day* of the commencement of the main scene, S'ak is sent to her husband's place by Kaśyapa who had arrived from his sojourn *on the previous night* ('तत्रभवता प्रवासादुपावृत्तेन काश्यपेन' ; 'अद्यैव ऋषिप्रतिरक्षितां त्वां भर्तुः सकाशं विसर्जयामि')। The act ends sometime between 9 A. M. and 12 P. M. (शार्ङ्गरवः—

युगान्तरमारूढ़ःसविता)।

* (Then enter on a seat, the King, the Jester and attendants according to position. In the tiring room, the sound of a lyre). Vidūşaka* (Leanin his ear).—Ho friend ! (*please*) pay heed to the interior of the music-saloon. A combination of notes of 1 yre, perfectly faultless with reference to (*musical*) timing and concord, is being heard. Methinks Her Ladyship Hamsapadika is practising (*her*) notes.

 **152n. 1. (विभवतश्च) परिवारः**—(Occurs in Mala,) परिवार—any attendant such as theportress &c. ; *optionally* परीवारः'उपसर्गस्य—c.' ६।३।१२३ इति दीर्घः*Cf*.यथानिर्दिष्ट-परिवारो राजा—*Act. II*. This part of the stage direction is necessary, as otherwise the presence of *Vetravati (portress)* a little after cannot be accounted for.**2**. **सङ्गीत-शाला**—Mark that music and painting, (*for whichvide Act VI*) were *sin qua non* in the days of our poet. It was perhaps considered a part of accomplishment (*even of the noble ladies*) in the society. Vide Ram. II, 3, 17-18 ; PN—Act, II, **3. ताल**—Musical time or measure. **लयः**—Musical concord or harmony. **विशुद्धा**—A song is विशुद्धा when it is sung faultlessly with reference to musical time and concord. Cf. "गीतयः पञ्च शुद्धाख्या भिन्ना गौड़ा निवेसरा। साधारणीविशुद्धा स्यादवक्रललितैः खरैः"—SR. **वीणायाः**—वीणा (*lute*) is a kind of Sitar ordinarily consisting of three strings. A variety of this with *seven* strings is called परिवादिनी (*i. e. modern sitar*)—“सातु तन्त्रीभिः सप्तभिः परिवादिनी'—AK. Vina is a very old musical instrument, as mention of it



along with Drum (दुन्दुभि) and flute is made even in the RV, A variety of it with *hundred strings* has been noticed by Katya-yana in his *Kalpasutra*. The sound of lyre was first noticed by the king, the song of *Hamspadika* following a little after is heard later on. **4. स्वर-संयोगः—**refers to the seven sounds 'ष', 'ऋ', 'ग', 'म', 'प', 'ध', 'नि' first discovered by the Hindus. These key-notes of music were taken from the sounds of beasts and birus. "षड़ज रीति मयूरोहि, गावो नदन्ति च ऋषभम्। अजा विरौति गान्धारं, क्रौञ्चो नदति मध्यमम्॥ पुष्पसाधारणे काले कोकिलो रौति पञ्चमम्। अश्वश्च धैवतं रौति, निषादं रौति कुञ्जरः”—*Narada*. Hence स्वर-संयोग means the permutations and combinatious of various स्वरःऽ। **वर्ण-परिचयं**Practising ष, ऋ, ग, म, &c. 131 *n. 4*. According to M वर्णmeans a musical mode; these are numerous, personified either as male (रागः) or female (रागिणी)। “गीतिषु चत्वारोवर्णाः भवन्ति यदाह भरतः॥ स्थायी तथैव संचारी तथा रोहाऽबरोहिणी। वर्णाः चत्वारः एवैतेः कथिताः सर्वगीतिषु॥—S & C. **5. लोलुपः**—greedy. *64. n 1*. **6. चूत-मञ्जरीं****&c.**—An instance of Dramatic Irony. Though Sakuntala-affair is not known in the harem, still theaudience will find a hidden allusion to her. 122 n. I. (*middle*,. **7. कमल-वसति &C.**—You were once****excessively fond of mango-blossom and consequently kissed her ever and anon. But now youseem to be quite satisfied, by having only a stay (वसति, *whichsuggests the absence of enjoyment*)in a lotus which must be full-blownand hence whose charm of youth is gone.For गूढ़ार्थ (Com).Now वसति- मावम् a case of मयूरव्यंसकादि नित्यसमास, hence its further compound with निर्वृतं(*like words of* तिष्ठह्न *class*) is barred. 'चकारः अत्रअवधारणार्थः। तेन “परम-मयूरव्यंसक” इत्यादि समासान्तर' न स्यात्'—*T.754*. But *Bhoja* solves the difficulty by saying that they may *lead and not follow* in a compound. ("नानेन समासः अयन्तु समस्यते एव")। In a similar way 'प्रदक्षिणीकृत्य'—*Ra 1. 21*; 'प्रदक्षिण-प्रक्रमणत्'—*VII. 24*; जननान्तरसौहदानि—*V 20 infra*, are justified. In this particular place, however, we can avoid the difficulty by attaching the affix 'मात्रच in स्वार्थे(प्रमाणार्थे)। Bees are often described



as confined in lotuses. 'गुञ्जद्द्विरकों ह्ययमम्बुजस्थः'—*RS. VI, 14*; 'इदंरुणद्धि मां पद्ममन्तः कूजितषट्पदम्' —*Vik. IV. 40*. **8. विस्मृतः—**Kali. frequently uses this in the *active voice*, 'अहो विस्म तं मम हृदयम्'—*Vik. II*. : प्रथमं पुनःपुत्रदर्शनेन विस्मतासि'—Act V. 'सौधवासमुटजेन विस्तृतः संचिकाय'—*Ra. XIX*, *2* ; “अनसूया—एनां विस्मृतासि' ?—*SAK. 1*. शार्ङ्गरवः—यदा तु पूववृत्तम् व्यासङ्गात् विस्मृतो भवान्—*Act. V. Vide*. *27n. 3*.

 **Remark:—**The song of Hamsapadika is introduced only to show that the imprecation of Durbása, has now produced a complete change in the king's mind. Thus the audience can *preconceive* how the king will deal with Sak, and her party. Besides Vidūsaka's dismissal (*see next*) at this stage is necessary. For though the king at the end of the second act told the jester that there was not a jot of truth in Sak. affair, still we have strong belief that had he been present when the party of Sak. approached the king, he would have surely contradicted the king's statement. The king, hearing Hamsapadika's song, sends the jester to pacify her and thus an undesirable situation is nipped in the bud.

 राजा

—

अहो ! राग-परिवाहिणी गीतिः।

 King—Oh, a strain overflowing with affection (or passion).

 **विदूषकः—भो वअस्स। किं दाव गीदीए अवगदो अक्खरत्थो** \[भो वयस्य ! किं तावत् गीत्या अवगतः अक्षरार्थः\]।

 Vidūsaka—Ho friend ! Do you comprehend the: meaning of the wordings of the song ?

 **राजा**(स्मितंकृत्वा)—**सकृत्-कृत-प्रणयोऽयं जनः। तदस्या देवींवसुमतीम् अन्तरेण महदुपालम्भनं गतोऽस्मि। सखे माधव्य ! मद्दचनादुच्यतां हंसपदिका। निपुणमुपालब्धोऽस्मीति।**

** **King (Smiling.)—Once did I make love to this lady. So I have incurred a mighty censure (*from her*) apropos of queen Vasumati. Friend Madhavya! tell Hamsapadikā using my word, that I have been cleverly reproved.



 **विदूषक—जं भवं आणबेदि** \[यत् भवान् आज्ञापयति\]। (उत्थाय) **भो वअस्स ! गहीदभ्स ताए परकिएहिं हत्थेहि सिहण्डए ताड़ीअमाणस्स अच्छराए वोद-रात्रम्स विश्र णत्थि दाणि मे मोक्खो।** \[भो वयस्य ! गृहीतस्य तया परकीयैः हस्तः शिखण्डके ताड्यमानस्य, अप्सरसा वीत-रागस्येव नास्ति इदानींमे मोक्षः\]।

 Vidüşaka—As your majesty commands. (*Rising.*), Ho friend ! (*Once*) caught hold of by her, through others' (*i e. maids'*) hands by the hair-tuft, (*and*) being beaten (*to jelly*). there will be no liberation for me, as for a passionless (*hermit*) when captured (*unawares*) by a (*celestial*) nymph.

 **राजा—गच्छ, नागरिक-वृत्त्या सान्त्वयैनाम्।**

 King—Go (*and*) pacify her in the fashion of a spark.

"Hence in a season of calm weather,  
Though inland far we be  
Our souls have sight of that immortal sea  
Which brought us hither :  
Can in a moment travel thither :—  
And see the children sport upon the shore,  
And hear the mighty waters rolling over more,  
Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting.  
The soul that rises with us our life's star.  
Hath had elsewhere its setting  
And cometh from afar;  
Not in entire forgetfulness  
And not in utter nakedness,  
But trailing clouds of glory do we come  
From God, who is our home''—

 King (*Turns round, and gesticulating fatigue from office*)—Every creature is happy on attaining his wished for objects. But the fulfilment of king's end (*is*) chiefly for troubles (*or is only followed by fresh troubles*.) High dignity (or success) puts an end to anxious longing merely; the very task of guarding the thing acquired harasses. A kingdom (the administration of which is in one's own hand) is not for the removal of the great fatigue as for fatigue, like a parasol, the handle of which is held in one's own hand.

Ś reads “प्रतिष्ठाम्” and places it in opposition to “औत्सुक्यमावम्”, making 'राज्यम्' (*under-stood*) nominative of 'अवसादयति'। This construction, however, gets. a weighty support from the following line of Vik.—“अस्माकन्तु प्रतिदिनमियं सादयन्ती प्रतिष्ठाम्”**—***Act. III. 1*, Note also that owing to this very Hne, the reading **अवसादयति** should be preferred to 'अवसाययति'। C, however, censures this explanation and adopts the reading given in the text. **10. यथा श्रमाय—***R has* "न च श्रमाय"



but this is to be rejected as it contradicts the previous statement—“राज्ञां तु चरितार्थता दुःखोत्तरैव"। *K* apprehending this anomaly repeats the first negative (नाति) before न च श्रमाय, the two negatives are here employed affirmatively i. e, to affirm that royalty does but lead to personal fatigue. It is not for the removal of great fatigue and *not not for fatigu*e—M. (25n, 4). **अति**—Implies Cf. “अति-शब्दः प्रशंसायां प्रकर्षे लद्धनेऽपि च”—*Visva qtd. BhD*. Cf. 'तथा परिश्रमः परिखेदं नोत्पादयति यथायं परिभवः' —SV I ; 'It shall advantage more than do us wrong—*Julius Caesar III. 1*, **11**. **धृतदण्डं—**In the case of the king 'दण्ड' means 'dispensation of justice', 'chastisement'. Cf.‘यथापराधदण्डानाम्”— Ra. 1. 6, 'कृतदण्डः स्वयं राज्ञा'—*XV. 53*, 'दण्डंदण्ड्येषु पातयेत्'—*MS. VIII. 126, VII, 22; 23: 24*; In the case of umbrella it means the handle, Cf. 'ब्रह्माण्डच्छत्रदण्ड&'—DK (*opening verse*) ; छत्रेषु कनकदण्डः—*Kad ; Ku. V11, 89*. If the office of governing the people is looked after by an able minister then it brings comfort and happiness; personal supervision, on the other hand, conduces only to misery like a heavy parasol when carried in one's own hand. **12. आतपत्त्रम् —**आतपात् वायते इति आतप+त्रै+कः by 'आतोऽनुपसर्गे कः 3. 2.3 इति कः—BhD, but it is open to objection as we have not कर्मकारकin आतप। Cf. ‘आदन्तात् धातोः अनुपसर्गात् कर्मण्युपपदे कः स्यात्, न अण्'—SK. 2914, Hence according to RM 'क' comes by the special rule 'सुपि', obtained from the योगविभाग of the rule 'सुपि स्थः' 3. 2. 4. Umbrella was known to the *Hindus from a very ancient time. The Mahā.* makes frequent mention of umbrella (vide दानधर्म section), Panini long before Buddha mentions umbrella (छत्र) and gives its derivation in the Sūtra ‘इस्-मन-वन्-क्विषु च 6 4 97 and स्मृतिकारऽ both modern and ancient all follow the *Mahā*. in praising the gifts of umbrella. For detailed discussion on various kinds of umbrella vide *Jukti-kalpataru of Bhoja.*

 **Remark :—**प्रतिहारीbeing an अधमattendant should not address the king as देव। The proper term is भट्टा (Cf. अहो धम्माबेक्खिदा **भट्टिणो** infra,



61n, 4), Kali's प्रतिहारी uses this term in Malā. Same is the case with all the Bhasa dramas, Ratnavali, MR. But excepting one instance quoted above, प्रतिहारो everywhere in Śak, uses the term देव। This is suspicious. *May be it is a lapsus calami* on the part of the copyists.

The rule 'अस्मदो इयोश्च' 1. 2. 59 allows the use of अस्मद् in the plural number for singular or dual. TheVart. 'सविशेषणानाञ्च प्रतिषेधो वक्तव्यः', however, restricts such uses, when is qualified by any adjective (144n. 1), Later grammarians, however, justify the plural in certain cases by construing the epithet predicatively. Read 'नच विधेयोऽर्थ विशेषणमित्यतिदेशो भवत्येव'—*HD.* 'विधेयत्वात् भवतत्वे व'—**Śabda-kaustuva**, Hence the following uses may be deemed quite correct, 'एते वयममी दारा कन्येयं कुलजीवितम्'- Ku.

The former is disgusted with the bustle and tumult of the citypeople, while the latter is aggrieved with their addiction to pleasure। and consequent aversion to परब्रह्मचिन्ता।**स्नातः**—refers bodily cleanliness, Bathing purifies a man both *externally* and internally. Cf. 'स्नानं पवित्रमायुष्यम् श्रमखेद-मलापहम्'—*Rāja-ballava*. 'नद्यां प्रत्येकशः स्नाने भवेत् गो-दानजंफलम्'—*MP*. Again a man annointed with oil is considered unclean, specially by one who has bathed.

 **162n.—1. महाब्राह्मण—**महत् when compounded (2.1. 61.) with such words as मांस, शङ्ख, द्विज, &c. conveys a bad sense, 'शङ्खेतैले तथा मांसे वैद्यैज्योतिषके द्विजे। यात्रायां पथि निद्रायां महच्छब्दो न दीयते' ॥ Hence महाब्राह्मणmeans a low Brahmin. But such an epithet can hardly be applied to the king's hierophant. It may be argued that the aforesaid Kārikā has nothing to do with synonyms (i. e. ब्राह्मण)।Or most probably the Karikā is of later origin as Kali. has compounded 'महत्' with some of the forbidden words in a good sense. Cf. 'सन्तानकाकौर्ण महापथ'—*Ru. VII. 3*; where 'महापथ' refers to the *principal high-road*. Also 'पुण्योमहाब्रह्मसमूहजुष्टः'—*BK. 1. 4*. 'पर्षद्दलान् महाब्रह्मैः'—*Ibid. IV. 12.* In the present case, however, the epithet may be taken a bit sarcastic- ally for S'arngarava did not like the sycophancy of the priest regarding the humility of the king. **2. मध्यस्थाः—**Indifferent. The idea is- You may exaggerate humility on the, part of the king but it does not affect us in the least ; we, however, consider it but natural to every benevolent person. Besides we have no suit to urge nor petition to present. We are sheer escorts of Sak. and we are not directly concerned with how the king receives us. Of Gītā II. 56. **3. तरवः—** According

 King (*Looking at S'akuntala*.)—But this noble lady—who could she be, possessed of a veil and with the glimmer of her person not fully displayed, (*standing*) amongst the anchorites, like a fresh bud in the midst of seared leaves ?

 **163n.—1. प्रसण&c.—मुख-वर्णा** bere means the "outward appearance" (*Apte*.) or the expression of the face. HS omits वर्ण। **देव—**is unusual in the mouth of प्रतिहारी। 156u, remarks. **2. विस्रब्ध-कार्या—**The root स्रम्भ implies विश्वास and it is never to be spelt with palatal as is found in some editions. The root श्रम्भ, however, implies 'प्रमाद्' and can be spelt also with dental स। 'स्रम्भ-प्रमादे। तालव्यादिः दन्त्यादिश्च। श्रम्भते। 'स्रम्भते'—SK, 'स्रम्भु विश्वासे। दन्त्यादिरयम्। तालव्यादिस्तु प्रमादे गतः ' - SK 2346; 'स्रन्भु प्रतीत्यतिशय' इति गोविन्दभट्टः। 'दन्त्यादिरयम्' इति वर्णदेशनादयः—*Manoramā*. Thus विस्रब्ध (with स) is the only form obtained with 'क्त'। Meaini's 'विश्रम्भ' (*with palatal* श) supports विश्रब्ध, but it is doubtful whether it is in consonance with Panini's grammar. **3. अवगुण्ठनवती—**suggests the existence of veil in old times, which fact again corroborates the existence of अवरोध-प्रथा in some form or other. But "the custom in its present rigour dates undoubtedly from the period of Muslim rule"**—***The Way Of Indian Life by Sister Nivedita*. "Moreover it must be noted that the seclusion ![](../books_images/U-IMG-1737970733Capture2.PNG) ![](../books_images/U-IMG-1737970733Capture2.PNG), which were once mainly due to the fear of the Maho- medan conquerors do not exist in the same degree in provinces unaffected by those conquerors"**—***Brahmanism & Hinduism* (MI). Referring to RV. X, 85.33 and As valayana Grhya Sutra (1. 8. 7.), P. V. Kane observes 'This shows that no veil was worn by the bride and



she appeared in public without one ![](../books_images/U-IMG-1737970816Capture2.PNG) ![](../books_images/U-IMG-1737970816Capture2.PNG)![](../books_images/U-IMG-1737970816Capture2.PNG)in the Grhya & Dharma Sūtras there is no reference to any veil for women when moving in public"—History of *Dharma Sūtras* (P. 597).

however, construes 'सताम्' with 'धर्मक्रिया'। 'त्वं रक्षिता। त्वयि रचितरि सर्वे सन्तः। तेषां (अर्थात् सतां) क्रियामात्र-विघ्नोऽपि न संभाव्यते**'**—R. You being the protector.*all were righteous* and the rites which all of them performed were free from impediments. This also gives good meaning ; but do not the constant raids of the cannibals and the Ślokas (8, 9, *Supra*) support the existence of wicked persons in his kingdom ?

. **राज-शब्दः**—Kāli. seems to derive राजन् from रञ्ज, or thus राजते रञ्जयति प्रजा इति राज (धातूनामनेकार्थत्वात् रञ्जनमेवार्थः) + कनिन् Cf 'यथा प्रह्लादनात् चन्द्रः प्रतापात् तपनो यथा । तथैव सोऽभूत् अन्वर्थः राजा प्रकृतिरञ्जनात्'—*Ra.

(7n 4.) and *Mahā*(*XII. 1032*) derive राजन् from रञ्ज 'to please' \['रञ्जिताश्च प्रजाः सर्वास्तेन राजेति शब्द्यते\]। The hermits, however, here compare the king to the sun, deriving राजन्from the root राज्"to shine." (*U. 162*) which is the *real* derivation.

 Śarngarava—How is this (*from you*)? Your Highness is surely very well steeped in secular affairs (*and knows that*) people suspect a (*married*) woman having her husband alive, and residing exclusively in the family of her kinsmen, even though chaste, to be otherwise (*i. e. unchaste*). Hence a young woman is (*always*) preferred by (*her*) relatives to be near (*her*) husband, whether she is loved by him or not.

Literally. क्षेत्रिय means a disease that can be cured in another body, hence incurable. Secondarily it means, one deserving punishment in the matter of another's wife, hence an adulterer. The idea is this; You say Śak. is my legal wife, and I have revolved the matter in my mind, but I do not, in sooth, remember to have any connection withher, and this is why I am keeping silence. Nor on the strength of polygamy should you eggme to accept this lady, as she is enceinte. So my wilful acceptance of her will surely make me an adulterer and guilty thereby. How can I, a chastiser of adulterers, be an adulterer myself. *R*. reads **क्षेत्रिणम्** on which he comments thus:—'क्षेत्र' पत्नीयस्यासौ क्षेत्री' तं क्षेत्रिणम्।![](../books_images/U-IMG-1737284777Capture2.PNG)![](../books_images/U-IMG-1737284777Capture2.PNG)![](../books_images/U-IMG-1737284777Capture2.PNG) यत इयं गर्भिणी मया चेदधुना प्रतिगृह्येत तत्तदाहं क्षेत्रीस्यांन तु वीजी। अत एतज्जातापत्यं न औरसम्, अपि तु क्षेत्रजम्। तच्च औरसात् हीनमिति शङ्का। अथच अनेन ऊढ़ायाः परिग्रहे मत्क्षेत्रत्वमेव स्यात्, न तु धर्मपत्नीत्वम् इति शङ्का’। 'क्षेत्रिन् is the legal owner of the field and वीजी is the man who actually sows the seed. Hence secondarily क्षेत्रिन्****is a *nominal husband (AD),* while वीजी****is the *actual husband*. Just as a person sowing seed in another's field, the fruit goes to the क्षेत्रिन्, the possessor of the क्षेत्र (MS. IX, 32, 48-54), similarly by accepting this pregnant Śak, unto whom seeds have been sowed by another person, the king becomes merely a nominal husband and he will have no right upon the issue. Besides the position of a क्षेत्रिन्****is not at all honourable and this is why the king is unwilling to accept her. Ours is certainly a better reading. **2. प्रतिपत्सेय—**Either "receive", or "reply", (r*eferring to the previous speech of S'a'rngarava*). *Westgard gives "respondere"*as one sense of "प्रति + पद"। Cf.

here the marriage is not acknowledged by the king, hence Śak. says आर्यस्य and not आर्यपुत्रस्य। Cf. 'आर्यपुत्र (अर्धोक्ते) संशयिते परिणये न एष समुदाचारः—*V. Infra*.

 Śarngarava—Indeed do not (*accept her*). The sage—who consents to the wrong (*thou*) didst concerning his daughter and who in asking acceptance of his own filched property, has made thee like a thief, an object of gift—certainly deserves to be affronted.

 Śakuntalā(*Aside to the audience*.)—When such (*an ardent*) love has been reduced to this state, what will it avail to revive (*old recollections*)? Or (*at least my*) own self has now to be acquitted ; so (*I*) have set about it. (*Aloud*) My lord ! (*this being half-said*) when marriage itself is doubted, this should not be the proper form (*of address*). Paurava ! it is indeed worthy of you to repudiate, in such terms, this naturally frankhearted person, after having formerly hocussed her with solemn pledges in the hermitage.

 171n.—**1**. **मा तावत्**—Cf. **'मा तावत् प्रथितयशसां**' &c.—Mālā. (प्रस्तावना) ; 222n, 3. The whole speech of Śārngarava is sarcastic. He is highly incensed at the previous speech of the king (तत् कथम् इमामभिव्यक्तसत्त्वलक्षणाम् &c.—*Supra*) and implies—O upright king, you should never accept one who is big with child. *R* construes मा तावत्****with विमान्यः। **2**. **अभिमर्शाम्**—अभिमर्श means touch, contact, hence carnal embrace, sexual intercourse. The root मृशmeans 'to touch. 'मृश आमर्शने। आमर्शनंस्पर्शः'—*SK* *2541*while 'मृष' तितिक्षायाम् means '*to*



*forgive*'. 'आर्य मर्षय'—*VS. I; II9n*, 4. Hence अभिमष of *R, V,* Apte and others is erroneous and is to be rejected. Read 'विमर्शः परामर्शः। मुषि इति मूर्धण्यान्तपाठो हेयः। तस्य क्षमैवार्थः'। Also Cf. 'पराभिमर्शः न तवास्ति'—*Ku.

Or it may imply query. **10**. **समयपूर्वं**—समय means प्रतिज्ञा, सङ्केत, also ज्ञान and काल। The idea is :—You considered me (प्रतिज्ञापूर्वकम्) as the only mainstay of your family and then married me according to

 172n. **1**. **व्यपदेशम्** &c.—व्यपदेश "*that by which* one is designated' (व्यपदिश्यते अनेन **करणे घञ्**) *i. e*. a family or race. Cf. 'अथ कोऽस्य व्यपदेशः’—Śak. VII. 'व्यपदेशकुले जातः**'**—Rām. IV. 64; 20, 117, III 12, 13. Sometimes it means a name. Cf. 'एवं व्यपदेशभाजः'—*UC.

Cf. "पुनरोधेण हि युज्यते नदी”—*Ku. IV. 44*. The word being masculine is in better consonance with व्यपदेश, so reject 'अम्भः'। **2.** **आविलयितुं—**'कलुषोऽनच्छ आविलः’—*AK*. आविलं कर्तुम् इति आविल+णिच \['तत् करोति तदाचष्टे"—*GS. 2573*\]+तुम्=आविलयितुम् 'to soil', 'to render limpid water turbid'. Thus it is ‘अन्तर्निविष्टकर्म', hence it cannot further take a कर्म (व्यपदेश)।



Now see 166n.4. **3**. **कूलङ्कषा**—itself is an epithet of the river as it undermines the bank. 'कूलङ्कषा नदी'—*VM. & BD.* (III-2-42) ; 'मुम्' by ‘अरुर्द्विषदजन्तस्य मुम्**’** 6. 3. 67. Now vide Ra.

 Śakuntalā—Just at the moment, my foster-child, a little fawn, Dīrghāpānga by name, came up. (*Then*) you saying, "Let him drink first," kindly coaxed him with the water, but he didn't get near your hand owing to unfamiliarity. Afterwards, when that very water was taken by me, he made love (*to it*). Then you jested thus—"All trust (*their*) own kindred ; even both of you are wild."

'प्रायः समानविद्याः परस्परयशः पुरोभागाः'—Mālā. *I. 2o*. Also 'किमिदानीं पुरोभागाम्'—Rām, IV. 2o.4 ; कृतापराधाम् इत्यर्थः—



Rāma. पुरोभागिनी means one who chooses the first *i. e*. fault, as generally it is taken notice of by people before merit is accounted for. Or the word may be explained as one that tries to be conspicuous by being put in the front and this is possible only by pointing out faults of others, hence in any case it means '*fault-finding*'. Then the sentence means—you only find fault with the king because he has disowned you. But you forget that you are also committing an offence by following us without the permission of your husband. (See next ). **3. स्वातन्त्र्यम्** &c.–The scriptures sanction no liberty in the case of women. Cf. ‘कौमारे रक्षिता तातो दत्वा पात्राय सत्कृती। सर्वदा रक्षिता कान्त स्तदभावे तत्सुतः॥ विष्ववस्थासु नारीणां रक्षितारस्त्रयः सदा। याः स्वतन्त्राश्च ता नष्टाः सर्वधर्मबहिष्कृताः'॥ *BrP. XVII ; GP. XCV ; MS. IX.3 ; V. 148; Y. 85 ; Śukraniti. III. II ; II5*. **दास्यमपि—**Cf 'या दास्यमप्यस्य लभेत नारी सा स्यात् कृतार्था किमुताद्धशय्याम्'—Ku. VII. 65.

 **Remark:**–In the last line the word पतिis used while in the first line we have क्षितिप, still there is no प्रक्रमभङ्गदोष। For reasons and the proprieties of the two words vide Com.

**181n.—1.** **भवन्तमेव** &c.–Thepassage is *obscure*for it isnot certain to whom the speech isaddressed. M takes it to refer to the priest. In thatcase the idea is:—Sir, you have all along heard the conversation that passed between Śārṅgarava and me. The sage insists upon my taking this woman as my wife, but I do not remember to have married her at all. The sage. however, suggests an alternative, and a possible one too, that Iactually married her, but my attention being divetted by multifarious duties I have forgotten her at the present moment. Hence tell me, of the two alternatives (*viz.,* the repudiation of the legally married wife and the fornication with another's wife), which is less sinful, Inthis explanction the *following defects*should be noticed. (*a*) There is no reason why a *stage-direction* like ‘पुरोहितंप्रति’should be omiited when the speech is uttered respecting a *third person.*(*b*) एवम्‌ in भवन्तमेव seems tolose its forces. Again a reference to the priest will suggest an indecision on the part of Duṣyanta who had been all the while thinking that he was right ; besides the speech will go against the saying—'आर्ये, प्रथितं दुष्यन्तस्यचरित्रम्‌। प्रजास्वपीदंन दृश्यते—*Sipra.* Thenext stage direction (viz. 'विचार्य') is of course in quite consonance with the speech. The priest being asked to give his opinion cannot say anything haphazardly, hence the necessity of deliberation. Next the passage may also be taken as addressed to Śārṅgarava himself (*as suggested by* एव). Of course in this case no stage-direction is necessary.Then the idea is:–You mean to say Iam repudiating this lady sheer whimsically and not because I am afraid of sin; but I ask you your-self, sir, if you were in such a dilemma, what would you do? CertainlyŚārṅgarava could not say that the second alternative was less sinful, His only recourse is to keep silent. But in this explanation the stage-direction विचार्यhas no significance, for an *advice gratis* of the priest. a third person, is quite uncalled for specially to aking. Read “ना पृष्टः



कस्यचिद् ब्रुयान्न चान्यायेन पृच्छतः। जानन्नपि हि मेधावी जड़वल्लोक आचरेत्”–MS. II. 11oThe first explanation, however, seems to be preferable, as later on in *Act, VII. 3I.* the king admits that he had doubt about his own action towards Śak. Also ‘सन्धिग्धबुद्धिं मां कुर्वन्' &c*.–Supra*. 'संशये' in this Śi. also suggests the same. N alone notices a variant stage-direction **'पुरोहितं प्रति'** which solves the difficulty to some extent. **2**. **गुरुलाघवम्—**The form is obtained by adding अण् to गुरुलघु (*Com*). Now अण् would cause पूर्वपदवृद्धि by 'तद्धितेषु अचाम् आदेः' 7. 2. 117. But 22 Sūtras beginning from 'उत्तरपदस्य' 7. 3. 10. and ending with 'यथातथ-यथापुरयोः पर्यायेण' 7. 3. 31 mention the exceptions where ञ-ण-ककारानुबन्ध Taddhita affixes cause only उत्तरपद-वृद्धि। According to soms the उत्तरपदवृद्धि in गुरुलाघवम् is causep (*as in परमनैष्किक*) by the rule 'परिमाणान्तस्याऽस' ज्ञाशाणयोः' 7.3.17. According to the follower of Vṛttikāra this form is not available by the above rule—Vide KV. & *Prabhā*. In any case the formation of the word cannot ibe questioned as it has been used by Patañjali & others. Cf. “पर्यायशब्दानां 'गुरु-लाघव-चिन्ता नास्ति'—*MBh*; 'आरभेत ततः कार्यं संचिन्त्य गुरु-लाघवम्'*–MS. IX. 299. Mahā. XII. I273 ; III. I0572*. 'विमृश्य गुरुलाघवम्'—Ram. IV. 2.4 ; 32.2. **3. संशये—**सम+शीlit. means 'to lie down together', hence when two or more propositions come together they create some sort of doubt. **पाशुलः—**defiled. *Ra. 11. 2.* **4.** **कुत इदम्** &c.—The speech is quite in keeping with the peculiar style of the old Professors of Philosophy carrying on discussion on abstruse subjects. **आदिष्ट-पूर्वः**—'आ+दिश् means to pronounce as a boon, to predict. Cf. 'सिद्धादेशकेन साधुना व्यादिष्टा'—Malā. V; 'सिद्धादेशेन आदिष्टा योऽस्याः पाणिग्रहणं करिष्यति' &c.—Rat. IV; 'सिद्धादेश प्रत्यय'—Ibid I. 'आदेशिकैःआदिष्टा देवी भविष्यति'—SV.

 **Time-analysis of Act V—**The action of the fifth act takes place on the day following the departure of Śak. and her party from the hermitage of Kaṇva. This is inferred from the following reasons—Kaṇva's hermitage was situated somewhere near the valley of the mount Himalaya ('एते खलु हिमगिरे रूपत्यकाऽरण्यवासिनः काश्यप' &c.—*Act V)*; and from the speech of the king to Śak. on the eve of his departure from the hermitage (*Cf.*'एकैकमेव दिवसे' &c—*VI. 12*) we know that *three, four, or eight* days, are necessary for a journey from the hermitage to the city and back. This places the hermitage at a considerable distance from the king's capital. Besides this statement is also in quite consonance with the statement of the Mahā. where the metropolis of Duṣyanta (*i. e. the city of* प्रतिष्ठान or हास्तिनपुर) is said to be 2 योजनऽ (*i. e*. a little more than 18 miles) from the hermitage. \[Cf. ‘वनमालोकयामास नगराद् योजनद्वये'।soal 'आश्रमात्तु ![](../books_images/U-IMG-1736571594Capture2.PNG) द्वितीय-योजने विप्राः प्रतिष्ठानंप्रतिष्ठितम्'॥ also 'स्याद् योजनंक्रोशचतुष्टयम्'—LīlāvatīAgain क्रोश=अष्ट-सहस्र-हस्त-परिमाणम् (*Ibid*). Thus one क्रोश=4000 *yds*.=2miles+480*yds*.\]. The party arrived at the king's place when Duṣyanta was taking rest in his inner-apartments, after finishing his mid-day duty, \[Read 'तथापि इदानीमिव धर्मादुत्यिताय' &c.—Kancukī's speech\]. This must be the sixth part of the day *i. e*. roughly 1-30 P. M. to 3 P. M. \[Cf. 'व्योममध्ये षष्ठे कलित्वमपि लभसे देव विश्रान्तिह्नः'*—Vik. II. I; Dr. Wilson's Hindu Theatre P. 209; MS. VII. 221 and Medhātithi and Govindarāja thereon.* The scene perhaps ended a bit late in the afternoon.

He is the brother of the king's concubine (अनूढ़ा). Read 'मदमूर्खताभिमानदुस्कुलतैश्वर्यसंयुक्तः। सोऽयमनूढ़ा-भ्राता राज्ञः श्यालः शकार इत्युक्तः॥*—SD. III. 80*; 'काणेलीमातः'*—Son of an unmarried lady—MK. VII*. Born very low, he is raised to power by reason of his connexion with the king. He is also called शकार for his using Śakāri dialect. 'शकार भाषा-प्रायत्वात् शकारोराष्ट्रियः स्मृतः। In *MK,* शकार (श्याल) plays a prominent part. **3. कुम्भीरकः—**कुम्भीनं हस्तिनम् ईरयति (अन्यत्र प्रेरयति) इति कुम्भिन्+ईर अण् कर्तरि ('कर्मण्यण्' 3. 2. 1.) कुम्भीरः— *BhD*. Next स्वार्थे कन्। कुम्भीरकः originally means a crocodile that drives away an elephant, and next perhaps from the thievish nature of it, the word means a thief. Or 'कु' means earth, hence secondarily 'an earthen wall'; 'भिद्' means *to break,* hence a burglar that enters a house after breaking the earthen wall. Except *R* others read कुम्भीलकwhich also means the same. Cf. ‘कुम्भीलः शालमीने च चौर श्लोकार्थ-चौरयोः'*—Medini ; Kāli* has used the first *twice* in *Vik* and the second also *twice* in *Mālā.* Cf. 'क्व गतः स रत्नकुम्भीरक'—*Act. V.* 'गृहीतस्य कुम्भिरकस्यास्ति'—*Act. II.* 'कर्मग्गृहीतेन कुम्भीलकेन'—*Act. III*. ‘अहोकुम्भीलकैः कामुकैश्च'*—Act. IV*. The fisherman here is speak-



ing the मागधी dialect (*a variant of Śakāri language*) in which 'र' is replaced by 'ल', and 'स' or 'ष' by 'श' by 'रसोर्लशौ' and in the nominative 'अ' (singular) by 'ए' \['अत इदेतौ लुक् च'\]। **4. महामणिभासुरम् &c**.—is preferable to मणिबन्धनोत्कीर्णनामधेयम्, for this means either (*i*) that the name was engraved on the *collet* where usually the gem is set (*M*). This supposes the *absence* of any gem; or, (*ii*) the setting of the various gems (मणीनां बन्धनम्) were so skillfully done on the ring as to imprint the name of the king (*i. e.* the three letters दु-ष्य-न्त) therein. This supposes the *existence of many gems.* The former contradicts the lines ![](../books_images/U-IMG-1736572502Capture2.PNG) ![](../books_images/U-IMG-1736572502Capture2.PNG) ![](../books_images/U-IMG-1736572502Capture2.PNG) तावत् एतत् महा**रत्न**भासुररमङ्गुलीयकम् &c, (*speech of पुरुष*)। ![](../books_images/U-IMG-1736572502Capture2.PNG)कथयति महार्ह**रत्नेन** &c. (*speech of जानुक*) which clearly state the *existence of a precious gem.* The second also is condradictory to the line 'न तस्मिन् महार्हं**रत्नं**भर्तुः' &c. which proves the existence of a *single gem*. Mark also that the word भासुर (*B*) is repeated in the speech of पुरुष (*Cf*. 'तस्य उदराभ्यन्तरे एतत् रत्न-भासुरम्' &c). **5. भावमिश्राः—***7n. 1*. A respectable person should be addressed as भाव.

'मान्योभावस्तु 'वक्तव्यः'—*Bharata.* “आत्मा भावो, मनो भावो भावः सत्ता भवोऽपि च।भावो पुज्यतमो लोके पदार्थोभाव उच्यते”—*Gadasingha*. **6. राजकीयम्=**राजन्+छ—pertaining to a king. राजन्=राजक by 'राज्ञः क च' 4. 2.140. छ=ईय7.1.2. 'राज्ञः ककारश्चान्तादेशो भवति कश्च प्रत्ययः। राजकीयम्। आदेशमात्रमिह विधेयं, प्रत्ययस्तु वृद्धाच्छ ४।२।१४१ इत्येव सिद्धः'—*Vāmana*. **लज्जा**=राज्ञा ('प्यन्यज्ञक्षां ज्जः')। **7. प्रतिग्रहः—**Gift, the receiving of which is one of the five duties of a Brāhmaṇa. Cf. “अध्यापनमध्ययनं यजनं याजनं तथा। दानं प्रतिग्रहश्चैव षट्कर्माण्यग्रजन्मनः”*—MS. X.75 ; I. 88; 1. 118, Bṛhat Parāśara.* Ch.



IV; 49n. 1. **कलिय**=कृत्वा (मनसि) ; Cf. “परकीयमिति कृत्वा”—Māla. II ; or **कलिअ**=कलयित्वा (R)—regarding. Cf. GG. IV. 7 ; SPB.

The 'क' added to 'नाटित', may possibly signify a poor, sorry, or ludicrous gesture. It is often *pleonastic*, but in the plays it will sometimes be found affixed to the past passive participle to which it gives the sense of a verbal noun. Thus ‘उद्भान्तक' (उद्भ्रान्तकेन निष्क्रान्ता—*Act. VI. Infra*.) 'अपवारितक' (*MK. V.*) for 'उद्भ्रान्ति' and 'अपवारण'—*M.* Generally stage direction with क्वाच्, ल्यप्, comes at the beginning of a speech. Cf. 'कर्ण दत्वा';**'**निपुणंनिरूप्य', 'अवतीर्य'—Act I and so on. Hence **भीतिं नाटयित्वा**(S) seems to be preferable. **पाटच्चर—**पाटयन् चरति यः सः।One who moves about by breaking walls. (अच् 3. 1. 134. पृषोदरादित्वात् स-लोपः 6. 3. 109. Otherwise the form would have been पाटयच्चरः।Cf. “वर्णागमौ गवेन्द्रादौ, सिंहे वर्ण-विपर्ययः। षोड़शादौ विकारः स्यात् वर्णनाशात् पृषोदरम्”॥—*BhD*. Or पटयन् वेष्टित इव चरति यः सः पटच्चरः—one that moves under cover (*of darkness*), hence a thief. Cf. 'चौरजीर्णपटयोः पटच्चरः' इति नामानुशासनम्। Vide also *Trikānda-viveka* of *Ramānātha Vidyā- vācaspati*, Next पटच्चर एव पाटच्चरः। स्वार्थं अण्। Cf. 'पद्मिनी-परिमलाऽलि-पाटच्चरैः'—*Bhāminibilāṣa.

* ***Remark.—**The city-superintendent is here speaking शौरसेनी dialect though according to *Viśvanātha Kavirāja* he should speak दाक्षिणात्य form of *Prākṛta* (वैदर्भीभाषा)। Cf. “ योध-नागरिकादीनां दाक्षिणात्या हि दिव्यताम्”।

For the fisherman caste (निषाद) is one of the lowest. Vide MS. X. 46-48.

 **188n.—1. गृध्रबलि** &c.—In old times a culprit condemned to death, was impaled and his body was allowed to stand on the stake, until it was devoured by vultures and other birds.

He has supported the interpretation by a reference to two other passages, one in Act VII of this play (पुत्रमुखदर्शनेन), another in *MK* (*P. 303, 1. 4. Cu. Ed.*). Doubtless 'पुत्रमुख दृश्' is a comraon phrase, but the whole point of this passage seems to me to lie in the ludicrous substitution

The other day (*186n. 1*) I had caught a big carp and got a ring in its maw. The fish I sold in the market and with its price I lived for some days. Then with the valuable ring in possession I did not want to go to fish for a few days, as it would bring me a large sum in exchange. Now that the ring is taken by the king, I am at a loss for the maintenance of my family *today* (V). M and his followers take it as a *return-taunt* of the fisherman to श्याल for his 'विशुद्ध इदानीमाजीवः'। But this does not harmonize with the previous and the following speeches of the fisherman and श्याल। With the other reading (B), translate “**Y**ou've ransomed me life"—*RobiDatta.* **4. अङ्गुलीयक-मूल्य** &c.—Equal to the value of the ring.**संमित**—Similar, equal.

'आनाम्यम्' means ‘अभिभवनीयम्'—what ought to be overpowered, hence 'मूल्यम्' means 'the price, worth, cost', because articles like 'cloth' &c. are produced by the outlay of stock or capital (मूल); '*price*' being a thing which, because it is capital plus profit, is superior to capital, and thus by price or 'मूल्यम्', the



capital or 'मूल' is overpowered'—*S. C. Vasu (SK*).

** Remark—**The above dialogue has been termed **‘अङ्गावतार’**by (B), supported by an authority like VK.

Also DR of *Dr. Haas*. The present dialogue gives an insight into the social condition of the days of Kāli.The then police, the *high officers* even not being exempted, were mostly uneducated and they generally used to belabour the accused, exactly as is done by the present-day police, for extracting the required confession. Bribe was frequently offered to hush up the police. Men of low classes were addicted to drink and frequented the dram-shops. The penalty for theft was an extreme one, and



the condemned man was impaled or eaten up by vultures or hungry curs. Buddhism was slowly progressing in the country denouncing the animal sacrifices performed by the followers of Vedic religion.

The wardrobe of some of our old comedians comprised a robe to walk invisible which *Gifford* supposes was a dress of light, gauzy texture. Something of the kind is used here apparently, as the stage directions are “covered with a veil”and “throwing aside the veil”—*Dr. Wilson*.

 (*Then enter, gazing at the mango-sprout, a maid-servant and behind her, a second*). First— O lightly-coppered, pale green mango-blossom, the be-all of the life of the vernal month, thou art seen (*by me*). O auspicious herbinger of the season, (*I*) propitiate thee.

 **द्वितीया—** **पर-हुदिए !** **किं एआइणी मन्तेसि** \[परभृतिके, किमेकाकिनी मन्त्रयसे।\] Second—Pārabhrtikā, what art thou chirping about to thyself ?

 **191n.—1. आताम्र**&c.—ताम्यतीति तम्+रक् =ताम्रम्; दीर्घं by 'अभि-तग्योःदीर्घश्च' (ऊ-183). ताम्रः गूणः अस्ति अस्य इति ताम्र+मतुप्=ताम्रः having the color of copper. मतुप् is elided by the Vārt. 'गुणवचनेभ्यो मतुप्लुगिष्टः' 1896.*106n, 7.* Similarly in the case with हरित।*AK*,however, does not seemto like this sort of convention. He says 'गुणे शुक्कादयः पुंसि, गुणलिङ्गास्तु तद्वति विषु i. e. when शुक्ल, ताम्र &c. mean ‘*one possessing that color*’ they assume the gender of the noun they qualify. **'आ'** means ईषत् and goes with all the three colors. Cf. Ra. VI. 17-18. **2. ०चूत &c—कोरकः** means 'bud'—*AK*. But 'कोरकोऽस्त्री कुड्मलेऽपि'—Medini. Also 'समुपहरन् विचकार कोरकाणि'—S'PB (RM). **3**. **परभृतिका & मधुकरिका—**are the names of two friends very happily chosen, as the cuckoo and the bee are closely associated with spring.

Kāli is fond of contrastive characters (24n, remark). **4**. **उन्मत्त** &c.



—The second maid asks the first one as to the reason of her muttering alone. Then परभृतिका using pun says that the cuckoo (परभृतिका) is intoxicated at the sight of the mango-buds and so also she is, and hence it is but quite natural for her, maddened as she is, to talk to herself. 5. **मधुकरिके**—Here is another play on words. It means also '*o bee*' (*Com*.) **6**. **मद-विभ्रम** &c.—(i) मद= intoxication, hilarity ; विभ्रम-गीत = amorous ditty. Or (ii) विभ्रम = wandering about. "This is the time for your (*applied to the maid*) amorous song through intoxication," or "This is the time for your (*applied to the bee*) hilarity, wandering and humming." '*Now this is the time for mirth, gaiety and song*'—*Roby Datta*. **7**. **अग्रपाद** &c.—118n, 3 ; standing on tip-toe.

 **प्रथमा—जइ मम बिक्खु अद्धं अच्चण-फलस्म**\[यदि ममापि खलु अर्धम् अर्चन-फलस्य\]।First—If mine too would be half the merit of the worship.

 Second—So it will be. my friend, even though unsaid. For, one only is our life, (*though*) our body be standing in two (*places*). (*Leaning on her friend and plucking the mango-sprout*). Lo, though not (*yet*) full-blown, the mango-sprout gets fragrant at the breaking of the stalk, (*Folding the hands so as to form a hollow*).

'पथि कुशलान्' पथिकान्। “तत्रकुशलः पथः” 5.2.63 इति ठक। But the Sūtra quoted gives वुन् (अक्) and not ठक्, and consequently the form is **‘पथकः'** and not 'पथिकः'। **6**. **पञ्चाऽभ्यधिकः**—“पञ्चानाम् अभ्यधिकः” (33n, 2).

You must be silly enough to make preparations for vernal festivities which have been prohibited by the king. **2.** **मधूत्सवे**—मधूत्सव of the Hindus may be indentified with the *saturnalia* or rather the *carnival* of the Romans. It was in old times performed in celebration of the *return of spring* and in honour of Kāmadeva (in modern times, in honour of his progenitor, Kṛṣṇa) with great pomp and eclat. Citizens both men and women, decorated with fine robes and ornaments, used to roam in the streets, dancing singing and beating drums, scattering red powders and coloured water with the help of syringe, upon the persons of their companions, Cf. 'मधु-मत्त-कामिनी-जन-स्वयंग्रह-गृहीत-शृङ्गक-जलप्रहार-नृत्यन्-नागरजन-जनित-कौतूहलस्य समन्ततः स्वच्छन्द-मर्दली-द्दाम-चर्चरी-शब्द-मुखर-रथ्या-मुख-शोभिनः प्रकीर्ण-पठवास-पुञ्ज-पिञ्जरित-दश-दिशः मुखस्य सश्रीकतांमदन-महोत्सवस्य'—Rat.

 First—Revered Sir, *(it is only)* a few days since we were sent to the feet of His Majesty by Mitrāvasu, the king's brother-in-law. And here the duty of tending the pleasure-garden was entrusted tous. Thus owing to our being strangers, the incident was not heard by two of us before.

If it may be heard by these persons, let Your Honour tell us why the spring-festival is interdicted by His Majesty.

** 194n.**—**1**. **नास्त्यत्र** &c.—should be assigned to Sānumati and not to the two maids as has been done by M. For the usualway of naming the king by the servants is 'भट्टा' or 'देव' (62n, 3) and not राजर्षिः as has beenused by सानुमती। (Cf. 'साम्प्रतमस्य राजर्षेः उदन्तं प्रत्यक्षीकरिष्यामि' (*supra*), also “राष्ट्रियेण भर्तुः पादमूलम्,” “किं निमित्तं भर्त्रा वसन्तोत्सवः प्रतिसिद्धः” (speeches of the maids). **2**. **कति दिवसानि** &c.**—पादमूलं** is indicative of *humble servitude*. 'मूल' here means 'अन्तिक'। “मूलमाद्य शिफायां स्यात् मे निकुञ्जेऽन्तिकेऽपि चे”—Viśva, “षष्ठी” after



**'गतानि'** &c. expressing the lapse of time, is very common in Sanskrit. Cf. 'मासी यातस्य यस्य'—SK. 716. “अद्य दशमी मासस्तस्य उपरतस्य"—MR. “अष्टपञ्चाशतं रात्र्यःशयानस्य अद्य मे गताः”—*Mahā. XIII.* 7732. 'भठ्टिनी-पादमूलम्' (R) is rejected as our poet elsewhere mentions maids being presented to the king and not to the *queen*. Read 'देव, अमात्यो विज्ञापयति। तस्मिन् विदर्भविषयोपायने द्वेशिल्पदारिके मार्गपरिश्रमाद् अलघुशरीरे इति पूर्वं न प्रवेशिते। संप्रति देवोपस्थानयोग्ये संवृत्ते'।—*MālāV.* 'शिल्पदारिकाभूयिष्ठं परिजन' च उपायनीकृत्य भर्तुः सकाश प्रेषितः'—Ibid V. In *Kād* चित्रलेखा also was presented to the king. **3.** **राष्ट्रियेण—**By the city-superintendent, the king's brother-in-law (श्यालः) mentioned in the Induction. Cf. 'राज-श्यालस्तु राष्ट्रियः'—AK. Or, Mitrāvasu is a person different from श्याल and probably acted as a kind of “Viceroy.” Sometimes राष्ट्रिय means a king. Cf. “राष्ट्रिय-श्यालः”—*MK. IX*. Also 'राष्ट्रीय' (H). **4**. **प्रमद-वनस्य**—प्रमदानां वनम् इति 'प्रमद-वनम्'। 'ङ्यापोः, संज्ञा-च्छन्दसो र्बहुलम्' 6. 3. 63. 'इति ह्रखः'—Bh. D. A pleasure-garden attached to the seraglio where the king takes his promenade with Vidūṣaka or with the inmates of the harem. Cf. 'स्यादेतदेव प्रमद-वनम् अन्तःपुरोचितम्”—AK. Sometimes 'आ' is not shortened. Cf.ह्रस्वाभावोऽपि। 'प्रविष्टः **प्रमदा-वनम्'** इति भट्टिः"—RM. 'वमञ्ज **प्रमदा-वनम्**'—Rām V. 41.15; 20. **5**. **किं निमित्तं**—36n, 3. 'निमित्त-प्रर्याय-प्रयोगे सर्वार्सा प्रायदर्शनम्'—इति प्रथमा—SK. 608. **उत्सव-प्रियाः**—Cf. 'प्रियमण्डना'—IV. 9.**उत्सव**—is to be derived from ‘सू’ “to give birth to” \[षू प्रसवैश्वर्ययोः\]। Lit. the word means "the birth of a son" which of course is the greatest occasion for joy, hence any festival. Note that our poet is a close observer of human nature. **6**. **बहुली-भूतम्** &c. —is स्वगतम् according



to HS. Owing to its wide publicity, the incident is almost known to all. Hence I don't think there will be any harm, if it is disclosed to these persons. 'बहुलीभू'—means 'to increase', 'spread'. Cf. 'बहुलीभूते कौलीने'—Rām. VI. 64. 30. 'पौरेषु सोऽहं बहुलीभवन्ति'—Ra. XIV. 38; 198n, 2 (middle). **7**. **शकुन्तला** &c.—**प्रत्यादेश**—Repudiation. कुल+ख—कुलौनः \['कुलात् खः' 4. 1. 139. ख = ईन 7. 1. 2. कुलीनस्य कर्मभावो वा युवाद्यण्(5. 1. 130) इति **कौलीनम्**—BhD. Primarily the word means 'nobility of birth', next it comes to mean 'something related to a big family which is to be kept secret', hence a family-scandal. Or, कुले जनसमूहे भवम् इति कुलीनम् i. e. arising from a 'crowd of men' hence a scandal; for people gathering together in a place generally speak ill of others. Or, 'कौ' पृथिव्यां लीनम् इति कौलीनम् i. e. which falls to the ground i. e. a scandal which generally has got no foundation. Read 'कौलीनमात्माश्रयमाचचक्ष'—*Ra.

 **उभे—अज्ज ! सुदं रट्टिअ-मुहादो अङ्गुलोअ-दं सणं जाव**\[श्रुतं राष्ट्रिय-मुखात् अङ्गुलीयक-दर्शनं यावत्\]।Both—(*We*) have heard from the mouth of the king's brother-in-law as far as the finding of the ring,

 **कञ्चुकी—तेन हि खल्पं कथयितव्यम्। यदैव खलु स्वाङ्गुलीयकदर्शनादनुस्मृतंदेवेन सत्यमूढ़-पूर्वा रहसि मे तत्रभवतीशकुन्तला मोहात् प्रत्यादिष्टेति तदाप्रभृत्ये व एश्चात्तापमुपगतो देवः।**

 Chamberlain—Then indeed very little remains to be told. When at the sight of ring, it was recollected by His Majesty, that Her Ladyship Sakuntala was, in sooth, previously wedded by him in private, and was rejected though infatuation—even thence-forward His Majesty is struck with remorse. For—He loathes *(everything)* delightful ; as before, he is not daily waited upon by his ministers; he spends sleep-less nights in rolling about on the edge of *(his)* couch. And when out of courtesy, he gives the wonted *(or suitable)* reply to the inmates of the seraglio, then blundering in *(their)* names, he remains disconcerted with shame for a long time.

Here an अव्ययsignifying 'intensity' (AK). But its use as an adjective is also not unusual. Vide 89n, 3; 201n, 8. **3.** **इतः प्रत्यादेशात्—**Repudiation from here (*i. e. me*). This furnishes the reason for her attempting **(व्यवसिता)** to follow her own party. **4**. **स्थिता—**implies instantaneous obedience to the mandate of her superior (शर्ङ्गरव) who loudly bade her stay. Thus the word brings out clearly the deplorable condition. M prefers "मुहुः" and translates—"repeatedly saying to her in a loud voice." Then it is obvious that Sak did not refrain from following her kinsmen at the *first bidding* of Sarñgarava. Thus the epithet **गुरु-समे** (अलङ्क्यादेशतया—*S qtd M*.) loses its significance. **5.** **बाष्प-प्रकर**&c.—'प्रकर'means समूह। Cf. 'वातेरितोत्पल-दल-प्रकरैः'—*Ra. IX. 56*. and *MN*. thereon.

  **203n.—1. न खलु** &c.—This is one of the many sentences to prove that Kali is a keen observer of the Hindu society. Mark how he rightly notices the psychological condition of a Hindu mother in such a juncture. माता च पिता च = **माता-पितरौ** (मातृ=माता) by ‘आनङ् ऋृतो द्वन्दे’ 6. 3. 25. Optionally **'पितरौ'**by 'पिता मात्रा' 1. 2.70 and not by ‘पुमान् स्त्रिया' 1. 2. 67. For मातृ is an eternal feminine form ('नित्यस्त्रीलिङ्गः शब्दः') and as such पितृ is not its corresponding masculine form, for it is also a (नित्यपुंलिङ्गः शब्दः )। Besides 'पिता मात्रा' which is a special rule becomes redundant, if पितरौ is obtained by 1. 3. 67. **'मातर-पितरौ'** is the third form by 'मातरपितरौ उदोचाम्' 6.3.32, and it is used by the people of the northern country only. Next **'पितरामातरा'** is the fourth form by 'पितरामातरा च्छन्दसि' 6. 3. 35 and it is used in the Vedas only. But Cf. 'रुदमाना तु सा देवी क्रोशन्ती **पितृमातरौ'**–PP. V. 16. **2. स्वप्नो नु** &c.—The king at present with the imprecation of Durbāsā gone, remembers Sak. He married her and enjoyed



ineffable joy in her company. But all these have now become a talk of the past. Sak escorted by several hermits and Gautami, approached him in presence of persons such as the royal hierophant, portress and others, but how was it that he could not recognise his darling! Was then this Sak affair a dream (**स्वप्नः**) ? But now he distinctly remembers that he interviewed the party in broad day-light in the Fire-sanctuary, in presence of the afore-said persons, hence surely he was not sleeping, and thus he could not be thought of dreaming a dream of Sak. Was it then a sorcery **(माया)** of any magician? But that is also not possible, as the effect of the spell lasts but for a very short time, whereas the king had not the slightest remembrance of Sak for a long period until the recovery of the signet-ring. The third alternative is to consider it to be a case of mental delusion **(मति-भ्रमः)=**But this also does not seem to be justifiable, as synchronous mental delusion of a host of persons is not possible. Besides delusion has its basis upon an unsubstantial thing. For people mistake and for aч and a respectively, or in other words they consider such things as snake or silver which are really not as such. This is of course due to delusion. Bur later on they being free from non-knowledge, can understand their mistake and the unreality of the things in question. Thus the king's is a quite different case, for he is now fully convinced that Sak did *actually* come and converse with him. Then perhaps the king enjoyed Sak's company for a *very short* time as a result of the scanty merits accumulated in his previous birth. Those merits being now exhausted **(क्लिष्टं पुण्यम्)**, that thing has also vanished. Hence



he is deprived of any further association with Sak. But one fact is certain that in any will not come to him again. the king's union with Sak is only. (Cf. 'यद्येवमस्ति खलु समागमः कालेन तत्रभवत्या'। 'न खलु मातापितरौ भर्तृ वियोगदुःखितां दुहितरं चिरं द्रष्टुं पारयतः।) But the king considers these hopes to be false and delusive like the erosions of river-banks. Just as the banks of the Ganges *(Padma)* quickly fall down, one after another, similarly the hopes of reunion, as voiced forth by Vidosaka are also unstable. **तत्** = पूर्वाऽनुभूतं शकुन्तला-समागम-लक्षणं वस्तु। i. e., either Sak's presence before him, or the happiness which the king experienced in her company. The word यद् is not necessary here (*Com. 1n, 10.*) Cf. ' ते हि नोदिवसा गता.'–UC. I. **असन्निवृत्त्यै** = असन्निवृत्तये—Never—to come back, passed for good. Cf. परलोकमसन्निवृत्तये यदनापृच्छ्य गतासि माभितः—*Ra. VIII. 49.* 'गतिस्त्वं वीतरागाणामभूयः सन्निवृत्तये'—*X. 27*. M splits up the fourth line as **मनोरथानाम् अतट-प्रपाताः**Again following the Mackenzie Mss. he reads 'एव' for 'एते', which according to *Prof. Patankar* is the *oldest* reading. This reading is also supported by K. But 'एव'here which is mainlyfor emphasis, following another 'एव' of the same nature in the third line, sounds un-kälidāsian. Besides 'अतट' ar.d 'प्रपात' are synonymous. (Cf. प्रयातास्तु अतटो भृगुः—AK. Kāli also uses 'प्रपात' in the sense of fall' and not to signify 'a precipice'. M still argues—"but there is no reason why अतट should not be used as an epithet of प्रपातto denote a very precipitious declivity." In the reading 'एते' for 'एव', 'एते' will



refer to स्वप्नः, माया, मतिभ्रमः and क्लिष्टं पुण्यम्। Besides the objections mentioned above, my attention is drawn by my colleague *Prof. Sureśa Candra Sen M. A. Vaidya-rañjana*, to the faulty nature of this explanation, as 'एते' (*masculine*) cannot refer to words two of which are masculine and feminine, while one is neuter. The right word should be one in **neuter** by 'नपुंसकम् अनपुंसकेन एकवच्चास्याऽन्यतरस्याम्' 1. 2. 69. Of course it may be argued that the violation of this rule is *often* noticed among the old writers. Cf. “आर्धिकः कुलमित्रञ्च गोपालदास-नापितौ। **एते** शूद्रेषु भोज्यान्ना यश्चात्मानं निवेदयेत्”॥—*MS. IV. 263*. **तट-प्रपाताः—**The poet perhaps is thinking of the erosions of the banks of the river Ganges (*Padmā*). Cf. “मूर्ध्नि गङ्गा-प्रपातेन"—*Ku. VI. 57*. 'गङ्गा-प्रपातविरुढशष्प"—*Ra. II. 27.* Ś explains the last half of the verse “As a man after ascending the peak of a mountain falls headlong, so my hopes after ascending to the sight of Sak are precipitated.' He seems to prefer splitting of “मनोरथा”—&c. For similar idea Cf. 'किंनु मेऽयंदिवास्वप्न श्चित्तमोहोऽपि वा मम'—*Rām. II, 12. 2* ; “किंनु स्यात् चित्तमोहोऽयं भवेद्वातगतिस्त्वियं। उन्मादजी विकारो वा स्यादयं मृगतृष्णिका”—*Ibid. V. 34.23* ; 'किन्तु सत्यमिदं खप्नः सा भूयोट्टश्यते मया'—*SV. VI. 17*; “Am I mad, or else this is a dream"—Twelfth Night. IV. 1."

Hence she had to change the ring from one finger to another, before it was well suited to one of her fingers. (2) The ring was a souvenir of love, and out of ardent affection, she had the ring placed round all her fingers with aview to



making it touch the entire hand. (3) Or, perhaps the ring was changed from one finger to another, as she grew leaner and thinner, day by day, owing to the extreme pangs of separation from the king—*R.*

M however explains एषः as referring to the king. “By my curiosity also he (the king) would be incited (to tell the reasons), *i. e.*, I too wished to put the same question to the king. **आकारित**=‘प्रेरितः’(K).

IV*. **5**. **अथेनां**—Is better than 'पश्चादिमाम्', as *already* mention (अन्वादेश) has been made of the signet-ring (इयंनाममुद्रा &c.) ; therefore 'इदम्' should be replaced by 'एन' (*Com*.) *6n. 6*. **6**. **नामाऽक्षरं—**अक्षर in the name (दुष्यन्त) may mean only *vowels* ('नामाक्षर' दुष्मन्त इति महाचक्रस्य शब्दस्य स्वरात्मकं वर्णम्'–HS).

But if it means *any letter, vowel or consonant* ('अकारादि-क्षकारान्तैक-'पञ्चाशद्वर्णः'—*Medini.* 'अक्षराणामकारोऽस्मि'—Gītā), then तावत्=**Eight days**. If we take into account the consonants (which cannot be pronounced without the vowels) then the time will be **five days**. R remarks—'त्रि-चतुर-दिनैः इति भावः' but his 'चतुर' is not clear. It is doubtful whether the king was at all definite about his time. **एकैकम्**—daily once only. **7**. **गच्छसि**=गमिष्यसि।By 'यावत्-पुरा निपातयोर्लट्' 2783.

X1V. 22*. also 'When every mornmy bosom glowed, Towatch the convoy on the road'.—*Emerson*.



 **Remark:**—It will be interesting to note that a ring episode somewhat similar to this, occurs in Katthahari Jātaka, where Brahmadatta, king of Benares, while out a-hunting married a sylvan girl and gave her a ring as a memento. But when the lady later on went to the king with her son, the latter, like Duṣyanta of the Mahā **wittingly** disowned her. This, however, does not establish Kāli's indebtedness to this Jātaka for the ring-episode, as the dates of various Jātakas are not ascertained. Besides presentation of a ring as *souvenir* is very common with the poets of all ages. Read “ददौ तस्य ततःप्रीतः स्वनामाङ्कोपशोभितम्। अङ्गुलीयमभिज्ञानं राजपुत्राः परन्तपः”—*Rām. IV. 44.* *12 ;* “अभिज्ञानं मया दत्तं रामनामाङ्गुलीयकम्”—*VI. 127, 45 ;* “तस्यैभर्तुः अभिज्ञानमुङ्गुलीयकम् ददौ कपिः”— *Ra. XII. 62.*

* *******सानुमती—रमणीओ क्खु, अवहीविहिणा विसंवादिदो**\[रमणीयः खलु अवधिः विधिना विसंवादितः\]।Sanūmatī—(*lt*) was too charming an arrangement to be frustrated by fate.

 Vidūṣaka—(*But*) how did it get inside the maw of the carp, chopped by the fisher-man ?

 **राजा—शचीतीर्थं वन्दमानायाः सख्यास्ते हस्ताद् गङ्गास्रोतसि परिभ्रष्टम्।**

 King—While doing obeisance to the Śacī-tīrtha, (*it*) dropped into the stream of the Ganges from the hand of your friend.

 **विदूषकः—जुज्जइ\[युज्यते\]।** Vidūṣaka—(*That's*) possible.

 **सानुमती—अदो क्खु तबस्मिणीए सउन्दलाए अधम्म-भीरुणो इमस्स राएसिणो परिणए संदेहो आसि। अहवा ईदिसो अणुराओ अहिण्णाणं**

 Sanūmatī—It was, indeed, for this that, as to poor Śakuntalā, this royal-sage, sin-fearing (*as he was*), had a doubt in (*his*) marriage. Or, how is it that love of such a type is in need of a souvenir ?

 **राजा—उपालप्स्येतावदीदमङ्गुलीयकम्।**

 **विदूषकः** (आत्मगतम्)—**गहीदो णेण पन्था उम्मत्तआणं** \[गृहीतोऽनेन पन्था उन्मत्तानाम्\]।Vidūṣaka (*To himself*) —He has taken to the ways of a bedlamite.

This is a *good* sign.

II. 15 ; SV. VI. 5. **मयैव** &c.—The action of the ring may be somewhat justified because it is *inanimate*. But the king's case stands unjustifiable as he, a *rational* being, disavowed the person who had been extremely dear to him. Mark that his determination of railing at the ring ends but in self-reprimand. **अवधीरिता**—97n. 5. “अवधीर्य” (with ल्यप्), however, has been used by *Māha* and *Srīharṣa*, *Sūdraka* (MK.

 **207n**.—1. **खादितव्योऽस्मि** &c.—Vidūṣaka though extremely hungry, cannot go away leaving the king alone, who has been



raving all the while. He expresses the keen-ness of his hunger by saying that hunger without getting anything as food, will surely devour him. Note that Vidūṣaka, as usual is contemplating about food. *222n. 7* (*end*) ; 72n. 1. Cf.

 **208n.**—1.**यद्यत्**—It is not possible to paint, in toto, all the human sentiments in a picture.Hence it is acommonpractice with the painter to print otherwise (अन्यथा) whatcannot be executed perfectly (**साधु**) in a picture or whatwhen painted as it is, will look other than fair.*Thus a*

*picture always falls short of the beauty of the original*. Nevertheless the loveliness of Śak has been partially delineated in the picture. Or, this may be explained otherwise thus:—The king did his best to improve upon those parts of the picture which fellshort of Sak's beauty.But her loveliness was of nonpariel nature and inspite of constant retouches, the picture does but partially imitate that beauty, *i. e.* it is inferior to the original. *For the difference between human being and its portrait.* Read—"*What find I here? Fair Portia's counterfeit!\*\* yet look, how far, The substance of my praise doth wrong thisshadow. In underprizing it, so for this shadow. Doth limp behind the substance."* The students may with advantage read the whole speech of *Basanio in Merchant of Venice, III. 2; Ra. XVIII, 33;* “चित्रगतायामस्यां कान्तिविसंवादशङ्कि मे हृदयम्। सम्प्रतिशिथिलसमाधिं मन्ये येनेयमालिखिता”–*Mālā II*.*2*. 2. **सदृशमेतत्** &c.—Like Vidūṣaka, Sānumatīalso thinksthat the picture is a faithful representation of the original.But the king is not



satisfied with it. He opines that Śak is far more beautiful. This exaggeration, however, according to Sānumatīis due to his ardent affection for Śak which has again been intensified through remorse. 3. **मोघदृष्टि** &c.—**मोघा—**useless, **दृष्टिः**=eye, hence one who has his eyes in vain.Cf. 'माधव्य, अनवाप्त–चक्षुः-फलोऽसि। येन त्वया दर्शनीयं न दृष्टम्'—61n. 5 Also 'हरिम्, अवलोक्य सफलय नयने'— Git. IX. 6. Sānumatī abuses Vidūṣaka as he considers all three equally beautiful. (Cf. 'सर्वाश्चदर्शनीयाः'—*Supra*.). Like the king, she also is speaking in this train, out of her ardent affection for Śak; for in sooth, Śak and her friends are *equally* beautiful, and Vidūṣaka is *right* to call all of them 'दर्शनीयाः'। Note that Duṣyanta also at the first sight considered *all three to be equally beautiful.* Cf. 'सम-वयो-रूप-रमणीयंभवतीनां सौहार्दम्'–Act I before 35n. Cf. also the idea in *BK. V. 19.* For **मोघ** Cf. 'याच्ञामोघा वरमधिगुणेनाधमे लब्धकामा'—*MD. 6.* 'मोघ-वृत्ति-फलमस्य वृथा चेष्टितम्'—*Ra.

 **211n.—1**. लेखितव्यम्—Excepting ***V***, all read '**लिखितव्यम्**'। Let us discuss which of these two is correct. Ordinarily 'लिख+तव्य' gives 'लेखितव्य' with regular गुण।'लिखितव्य' will be the form if ‘लिख’ is included in the **कुटादि** list. On this *Bopadeva* remarks—“अयंविभाषया कुटादिरिति केचित्। तेन लिखितुं विश्वसृजोऽपि शक्तिहानि रिति लिखितव्यं, लेखितव्यं, लिखनमित्यादि सिद्धम्”—*Kavi-kalpa-druma*. 'लिखन' is sanctioned by 'सारसुन्दरी' of *Mathures' a*. Cf. also “यस्य लिखनं पूर्वं यत्रकाले निरूपितम्। तदेव खण्डितुं राधे! क्षम्ये नाहञ्च को विधिः॥ विधातुश्च विधाताहंयेषां तत् लिखनं कृतम्। ब्रह्मादीनाञ्च क्षुद्राणां न तत् खण्ड्यंकदाचन”॥— *BrP.* *V*. But hosts of grammarians consider such forms as 'लिखितव्य', 'लिखन', 'आलिखितुकामः'—(R) &c. to be erroneous, for if लिख be included in the कुटादि list then *Pāṇīni's* 'आलेखन' (6.1.142) becomes unjustifiable. Read—“लिख अक्षर-विन्यासे। **लिखितुं, लिखिष्यति, इति प्रयोगः प्रामादिकः।** यत्तु कैश्चित् कुटस्य आदिः कुटादिः। कुटः कुटादिर्येषां ते कुटादयः। कुटादयश्च कुटादिश्च कुटादयः इति एकशेषंस्वीकृत्य 'लिखितुम्' इत्यादि समर्थितम्॥**तदसत्**॥ लेखिता, लेखिष्यति, इत्यादौ गुण-निषेधाऽऽपत्तेः॥ नः चेष्टापत्तिः॥ वृत्तिकार-हरदत्तादि-ग्रन्थ-विरोधात्। 'गाङ्लिखादिभ्यः' इत्येव सूत्रयितव्ये कुटादिभ्य

'स्वादय ओदितः' 8. 2. 45 ; \]=seated at rest. हंस serves God ब्रह्मा as a vehicle, and hence the cry of this bird has a sacred character, just as the cry of a swan with the Greek. This (also **निषस्स**and the action of मृगी) show that the swan-couple and the deer here are enjoying perfect security (even in the presence of human beings) as is natural in a hermitage. *Cf. Ra. VII. 75 ; BK. II. 18*. Also read “कैलास- वर्णना” of *Bhārata-candra*. According to *R* the prevailing sentiment is love. “(हंसमिथुना) इत्यनेन उद्दीपकत्वाऽतिशयो व्यज्यते। ![](../books_images/U-IMG-1736095012Capture2.PNG) ![](../books_images/U-IMG-1736095012Capture2.PNG) स्रोतोवहाइत्यनेन जलवाहित्वम्। तेन स्वभावाऽपरित्यागः तेन रमणीयत्वं, तेन च उद्दीपकत्वं व्यज्यते। निषण्ण-हरिणा इत्यनेन अत्यन्त-विविक्तत्वम्, तेन भृशमुद्दीपकत्वं। तेन च सुरत–क्षमत्वं ध्वन्यते”—'पावना' इत्यनेन शुचित्वेन रम्यत्वेन पर्यवसानम्” *R*. 3. **पादाः**—Spurs, hills contiguous to a high mountain. **निषण्णसहरिणाः**—(स =ष 8. 3. 66);55n. 1.

This is शाकपार्थिवादित्वात् उत्तरपदलोपीसमासः। VM cites this very word as an instance of मध्यम-पदलोपि-समास (Cf. 'बिम्बाधर इति वृत्तौ **मध्यमपद-लोपिन्याम्**'—*KSV. V. 2. 15*). This Vamana was *a rhetorician and different from the grammarian VM–author of Kās'ika Vṛtti, and is posterior* to him; for he quotes from Bhavabhūti (दोर्दण्डाञ्चित चन्दशेखर &c.), *AS* ('दृष्टैकासन सङ्गते प्रियताम्'—&c.) also from *VS, SPB, (I. 8, 12, 25, 71,) KS* and छन्दोविचिति। According to *Rājataranginī*he was contemporary to *Jayāpīḍa, king of Kasmir* (9th century A.

कवयस्तस्य वामनाद्याश्च मन्त्रिणः)। As far as grammar is concerned, this VM cannot be accepted as a *greater authority* than the grammarian VM, Nāgeśa, Kātyāyana, JS and others. Hence his statement of मध्यपदलोपी समासःis erroneous. Read ‘समानाधिकरणाधिकारे शाकपार्थि-वादीनाम् उपसंख्यानम् **उत्तर-पद-लोपश्च'—***KV.

'आः एष दास्याः पुत्रः कुसुमरसपाटच्चरः तत्रभवत्या वदनकमलमभिलङ्घति मधुकरः'—*Supra*) and he could not detect his mistake until his present speech was uttered, and then he laughed at his own stupidity. But now he says that through his association with the mad king he is just going to have an attack of insanity. There lies the humour, as we have seen that the reverse of it was true. Note that Vidūṣaka does not admit that he was mad at all, he was (**ईदृशवर्णः—*Lit.*** *of the same shade*). *i. e.,* on the verge of being deprived of his power of judgment.

 **215n.—1. एषः—**Certainly refers to the king. It is he who has painted the picture and therefore there is no wonder, if he experiences what he has painted.

before and 'अपर' what is seen later on. **विरोधी**—inconsistent Sānumatī means to say that the course of love-sickness (*of the king*) is very peculiar, as great deal of inconsistency prevails between his former and later actions. The king disavowed Śak when she came to his place out of her own accord, but when she was gone, he was overwhelmed with grief and actually wept for her. *R* explains differently thus—"पूर्वं चित्रस्य चित्रत्वेन ज्ञानं, पुन स्तस्योन्मादाऽवस्थायां सत्यत्वेन ज्ञानं, पुनरपि चित्रत्वेन ज्ञानम् इति पूर्वापरविरोधः। उन्मादाऽवस्थानन्तरं मूर्च्छाद्यवस्थाया अभावात् इति भावः। अत एव अपूर्व आश्चर्यकारी”। The picture was considered to be a picture first, and then in उन्मादावस्था it was mistaken for a real scene of life, and lastly it was again recognised as a picture, so there is inconsistency in his prior and later actions. Again his 'विरहमार्ग' is *extra-ordinary* as he did not swoon (मूर्च्छा, 9th stage) immediately after his 'उन्मादावस्था' (8th stage.) 196n.

*principal* verb must always be observed. Others, however, opine that समानकर्तृकत्व is compulsory with तुमुन् in connection with *verbs having the sense of desire only.* The Sūtra 'समानकर्तृकेषु तुमुन्' (*III. 3. 158 ; 3176*) has no connection with the other Sūtra ('तुमुन्खुलौ क्रियायां क्रियार्थायाम्' *III. 3. 10*) sanctioning तुमुन्।

The epithets **समुद्र-व्यवहारी** and **नौ-व्यसने** conclusively prove the existence of ships in ancient India, and also the prevailing practiceof trading in foreign lands with sea-going vessels.

Thus at the time of Kāli, *the widow of a deceased person could not inherit his estate*. The prevalance of this practice places Kāli in a *very antique period*, when this sort of law of inheritance of *Manu, Ápastambha*, *Bohhāyana* were not remodelled by *Viṣṇu, S'ankha*, *Likhita, Vrihaspati* and other later law-givers.

 **Remark**:—It is obvious that the importance of the introduction of the story of Dhanamitra is only to put vividly to the notice of the king, the helplessness of a man, wanting in issue and also to make him keenly feel for his legally married wife who was pregnant but ruthlessly repudiated by him (*S'l. 24 & 25 Infra*.)

'साकेत' is the name of Ayodhyā given by the *Buddhists* and it is often met with in the Buddhistic literatures. The absence of साकेत in the *Rām* according to *Dr. Jacobi* is a conclusive proof of its priority to Buddha. It is *masculine* according to यादव (*Com.*) but *neuter* according to शब्दरत्नावली।



Kāli elsewhere has used this word. **'साकेतोपवनमुदारमध्युवास'**—*Ra.XIII. 79 ; XIV. 13 ; V. 31 ; XVIII. 36*. **श्रेष्ठी**—'The head of a guild or corporation practising the same trade'—*M.* **2***.* **निर्वृत्तपुंसवना**—पुंसवन is the second of the 12 purificatory ceremonies and is performed on a woman's manifesting unmistakable sign of pregnancy, for the birth of a male child. Read“मासि द्वितीये तृतीये वा पुंसवनं यदा पुंसा नक्षत्रेण चन्द्रमा युक्तः स्यात्”—*Pāraskara*. “व्यक्ते गर्भे तृतीये तु मासे पुंसवनं भवेत्। गर्भेऽव्यक्ते तृतीये चेच्चतुर्थमासि वा भवेत्”—*S'aunaka*. “तृतीयस्य गर्भमासस्य आदिम-देशे पुंसवनस्य कालः”—*Gobhila*. **3**. **गर्भ** &c.—गर्भः = foetus. **रिक्थम्** — wealth. 'A child who is in the mother's womb at the time of the death of his father is, in contemplation of law, actually existing and will on his birth, divest the estate of anyperson, with a title inferior to his own,who has taken it in the meantime'—*Mayne's Hindu Law*. Read also "ये जाता येऽप्यजाता वा ये च गर्भे व्यवस्थिताः। वृत्तिं तेऽपि हि काङ्क्षन्ति वृत्तिलोपः विगर्हितः”—*Bhṛgu*. “उत्पत्त्यैवार्थं स्वामित्वात् लभेत इत्याचार्या मन्यन्ते"—*Gautamā*. **4**. **पापादृते**—Here पाप is an adjective (*Com*.) and is equivalent to "पापी", sinner, a wicked person. The idea is:—Duṣyanta will not fill up the place of that dead man who in his living time was a sinner; consequently when a man loses such a friend, naturally he deserves not king's protection. According to *M*, the king will not be a loving friend to a person who is living and is a sinner, even if he undergoes any bereavement. According to *R*, it means— 'Excepting sin' (*i. e. sinful act*). Or in other words the king will fill up that place of the deceased person, provided there is no sin in doing so, as there would be in his becoming a husband to a widow. "पापादृते। स्त्रीणां भर्तृत्वेन विना इत्यर्थः"—*R*. **5**. **घुष्यताम्**—

The idea is:—I have not only disavowed (त्यक्ता) my legally married wife which was a heinous crime but that was again foolishly (**नाम**) aggravated on account of the fact that even then she was bearing my seed in her womb (आत्मनिसंरोपिते) and as such was the only means of the continuity of my clan (कुलप्रतिष्ठा)। Now see *n. 4*. **2**. **कल्पिष्यमाणा**—The root क्लृप् (८।२।१८) has the sense of '*to be fit or adequate for', 'result in', 'tend to'.* Cf.

Before this (as will also be corroborated by Act II.) he was all the while talking to Vidūṣaka about the physical beauty of his lady-love Śak, and all his pinings seem to be only for material consideration. But a union of flesh can not be permanent.In the wordings of *Ravindra–nātha it only adds to the number of Hansa-padīkās (*'राजसभाय प्रवेश करिवा मात्र दुष्यन्य यदि तत्क्षणात् शकुन्तलाके ग्रहण करितेन, तवे शकुन्तला हंसपदीकार दलवृद्धि करिया ताहार अवरोधेर एक प्रान्ते स्थान पाइत"—*Sankalana. P. 123*.) This is why our poet by repentance and remorse thoroughly purgeshim of his earthly love and makes him conscious of the deeper meanings of विवाह, धर्मपत्नीand पुत्र। And he swooned aright as soonas he realized the fact that a Hindu wife was not merely for joy of this world, but it was a *sine qua* non for the clearance of hisown paternal debts and also for the solace and happiness of his ancestors that had long departed to another world. He had never before viewed this in such a light ; and consequently his ruth-less repudiation of śak barring his ancestors from joys in the next world, aggravated but his mental throe, and the shock thereof he was unable to bear. Thus his love for flesh is transferred by the elimination of its sordid elements into divine love and his purification is complete.And before long we shall hear the sound of the celestial car that will

A light covered by a screen or placed at a distance gives but darkness. Similarly the king, on account of his being at a very distant place, and also of his utter ignorance of his own son, सर्वदमन experiences despair only. ![](../books_images/U-IMG-1736183957Capture2.PNG)*Dr. Boethlink* proposes to interpret 'अन्धकार-दोषम्' by 'अन्धकार–दोषाम्—*dark night or the darkness of night* but this seems hardly a legitimate compound, nor does the sense require it' —*M*. **8**. **यज्ञभाग-समुत्सुकाः**—Owing to the slack administration caused by the repentance of Śak's repudiation \['प्रकृतिभिर्न प्रत्यहंसेव्यते'—VI. 5 ; 'ममापि सत्तैरभिभूयन्ते गृहाः'। 'अहनि अहनि![](../books_images/U-IMG-1736183957Capture2.PNG) ज्ञातुंप्रमादस्खलितं न शक्यम्'—VI. 25 ; the oblations of the sacrifices performed by his subjects are seized and carried away by the vigilant demons, the offsprings of कालनेमि \[अस्ति कालनेमिप्रसूतदानवगणः—*Infra*\] so the gods were debarred from partaking of their shares. Hence they are anxious (उत्सुक) for the reunion of the king and Śak. For then and then only proper administration can be expected from the king.

XIll. 7.* 'आत्तगन्धमवधूय शत्रुभिः'—*S'PB. XIII. 84*. **2**. **माणवकः**—To signify अपत्यजाति, मनु with 'अञ्' and 'यत्' gives 'मानुषः' and 'मनुष्यः' (1186). But as प्रत्यय's used in the sense of 'तस्येदम्' may be affixed to signify तस्यापत्यम्, so 'अण्' \[by 'तस्येदम्' 4. 3. 120\] may also be used after 'मनु' in the sense of तस्यापत्यम्। “तस्येदमिति विहितः अण् अपत्याऽर्थेऽपि भवति। इदमर्थे तस्यापि अन्तर्भवात्”—*BM* on Vārt. 2081. Hence मनोःअपत्यम् (कुत्सितम्) इति मनु+अण्=माणवः a deformed man. The cerebral 'ण' is due to the कारिका—“अपत्ये कुत्सिते चैव मनोरौत्सर्गिकः स्मृतः। न-कारस्य च मूर्धन्यस्तेन सिध्यति माणवः”।—*Qtd KV.* उत्सर्ग-प्रत्यय means the main affix as अण्। But *JS*. observes:—“इदं च वचनं 'ब्राह्मण–माणव वाड़वातयत्' ४।२।४२ ;१२५० इति णत्व-निपातनात् लब्धम्”—*T. 1186.* Also 'ब्राह्मण-माणव'—इति निपातनात् णत्वम्—*BhD*. Next 'कन्' अनुकम्पायाम्।Vidūṣaka is supposed to be deformed in body \[*55n. 1*\]. **3**. **मा तावत्**—181n. 1. The idea is—The portress says that the jester is overpowered by the evil spirits. But the king contends that it is not possible for the ghosts to haunt his palace, as he is virtuous (*I. 20*) and ever dutiful to his subjects. (*Note the* *force of अपि*). But simultaneously he changes his view (**अथवा**) and thinks that all this may



be possible. (*See next*). गृहाः—(masculine plural) means'a house'. Cf. 'इमे नो गृहाः'—*MK. I*. 'स्फटिकोपलविग्रहा गृहाः—*NC.II. 74.* 'धनपति-गृहान् उत्तरेण'—*MD. II. 14*. **4**. **प्रमाद** &c.—Sins due to carelessness. He is referring to the disavowal of his lawful wife through forgetfulness. **5**. **प्रजासु कः** **केन** &c.—The king himself does not exactly know what faults are committed by him every day. Hence it is but quite natural that he will be more careless regarding the courses taken by his subjects. Or in other words, the king is not ruling his subjects properly. So he has become a sinner. Read सर्वतो धर्मषड्भागो&c. 72. 7. Hence the presence of evil spirits. **6**. **अविहा**—A cry of distress—"save me here from danger". \[अव (save)+इह (*here*) \]—very frequent in *Mālā.* **7**. **पश्चादवनत**&c.—**शिरोधरा** (*f*) meansneck. Cf. 'गृह–कपोत–शिरधरामिः'—*S'PB. IV. 52.* Hence whose neck has been bent backwards. This is necessary for sucking blood. (*See next S'l*.). Words like '**पयोधरः'** (24n. 12), **'शिरोधरा', 'स्रोतोवहा'** (210n. 2) &c. present a grammatical difficulty. For 'धरः' (धरति यः सः), 'पचः' (पचति यः सः), &c. are formed by adding 'अच्' which is an 'अनुपपद'—affix. Or in other words, the affixes 'अच्', 'क', 'श' are used after roots when not preceded by any 'उपपद'। But 'अण्' is a 'कर्मोपपद—afflx' and such will invariably be used after a root preceded by a word in the accusative as 'उपपद' Now the *Vārt*."अकारादनुपपदात्"—&c. enjoins that the 'विप्रतिषेध', *i. e*. the subsequent Sūtra ('कर्मण्यण्'—3. 2. 1) will bar the application of the previous Sūtras (*i. e*. पक्षाद्यच्—3. 1. 134; 'इगुपधकः'—3. 1. 135; 'श'—3. 1. 138.). Read “इह उभयम् (अच्, अण्) प्राप्नोति॥ ओदनपाचः



कर्मोपपदोभवति विप्रतिषेधेन। इह उभयं(क, अण्) प्राप्नोति॥ काष्ठभेदः॥ कर्मोपपदोभवति विप्रतिषेधेन"—*MBh*. But with 'अण्' the forms become 'पयोधारः' ‘स्रोतोवाही’ ‘शिरोधारः' and so on. The difficulty is, however, avoided by *BD* *and his followers* by disregarding 'कर्मत्व' and attaching prominence to 'शेषत्व'।Read अथ कथं “न मह्यमत्र उत्तर-धारयस्य ते” इतिश्रीहर्षः। परत्वाद्धि सूत्रधारादिषु इव कर्मण्यणा भाव्यम्॥ तथाच वार्तिकम्॥ “अकारात्अनुपपदात् कर्मोपपदोविप्रतिषेधेन”इति॥ सत्यम्॥ कर्मणः शेषत्व-विवक्षायाम् अणःअप्राप्त्या शे कृते शेष-षष्ठ्यन्तेन समासो भविष्यति। एतेन गङ्गाधर-भूधर-जलधरादयः व्याख्याताः—*T; KSV.

HD. however, differs and accepts संज्ञात्व in such cases. **इक्षुभिव—**It is interesting to note that the jester who is noted for his greediness (55n. 1; 61n. 3 ) does not forget to mention something sweet, even in such a trying position.

 **226n**.—**1**.**शतक्रतोः**—Indra (*Jove or Jupiter Pluvius of classical mythology*) is called शतक्रतु according to the *Purāṇas* for his performance of *hundred horse-sacrifices.* Hence he always views with jealousy and alarm any persistency by a human being in acts of severe penance or one-hundred sacrifices which might raise him to a level with himself. *41n, 6.* Our poet also endorses this view. Read “जगत्-प्रकाशं तदशेषम् इज्यया, भवद्गुरुः लङ्घयितुं ममोद्यतः॥ हरिर्यथैकः 'पुरुषोत्तमः' स्मृतः। महेश्वरः 'त्रैम्बक' एव नापरः। तथा विदुर्मांमुनयः ‘शतक्रतु', द्वितीयगामी न हि शब्द एष नः”॥—*Ra. III. 48-49.* According to the western Vedic scholars, क्रतुस् (*Gr. Kratos*) in the Vedic Literature *invariably* means *'power' (i. e*. *wisdom, strength*) of mind or body. Hence according to them the epithet means *one whose power or wisdom is hundred i. e. infinite.* **सख्युस्ते**—Cf. 'अयंस वलभित्-सखः दुष्यन्तः'—*Act. II. Spura*. **अजय्यः**—Cf, 'तेन द्विपानमिव पुण्डरीको राज्ञामजय्योऽअजनि पुण्डरीकः”—*Ra. XVIII.* *8 ; 72n,* *8.***निहन्ता**—is a very significant epithet of Duṣyanta.

Next he continues—वस्तुतस्तु “षष्ठ्याःपति-पुत्र-पृष्ठ-पार-पद-पय-स्पोषेषु” ८।३।५३ ; ३६३८ इति सत्त्व-विधान-सामर्थ्यात् लोक–वेद-साधारण्येन “वृद्ध–कुमारी–वर”–न्यायेन अलुक् ज्ञापितः। कस्कादित्वात् ८।३।४८ ; १४४ सः। यत्तु “षष्ठ्याः पतिपुत्र—"८।३।५३ इति सत्वम् इति मुकुटेनोक्तम्॥ तन्न॥ तस्य छन्दोऽधिकारात्'। *i.e.,*अलुक् of षष्ठीविभक्ति of दिवःis to be inferred from the Vedic *Sūtra* (*8.3.53)* by the “*maxim of the old virgin's boon*" (वृद्ध–कुमारी-वर-न्याय) which has been thus explained by *Patanjali*:—“वृद्धकुमारी इन्द्रेणोक्ता, 'वरं वृणीष्व' इति। सा वरम् अवृणीत—'पुत्रा मे बहु-क्षीर-घृतमोदनं काञ्चन-पात्र्यां भुंजीरन्' इति। न च तावदस्याः पतिर्भवति। कुतः पुत्राः। कुतो गावः। कुतोधान्यम्। तत्राऽनया एकेन वाक्येन 'पतिः', 'पुत्राः', 'गावः', 'धान्यम' इति सर्वं संगृहीतं भवति इति”—*MBh* on “न मु, ने” 8. 2. 3. In other words the boon covers



all that she wishes to have, such as progeny, abundance of corn, cattle and gold. Similarly because the *Vedic Sūtra* (*8. 3. 53*) enjoins that the षष्ठी–विसर्जनीयshould be changed into 'स' with such words as पुत्र &c., therefore the inference about *Pāṇini's* view is that the षष्ठी विभक्तिin such cases should be अलुक् in the समासवाक्य।Next कस्कादित्वात् सः। *BhD* follows *Vardhamāna* who has included दिवस्पति in the कस्कादि—list, which is आकृतिगण। *Kramadis'vara* has simplified all such anomalies by framing a Sūtra "कृचिदन्यत्रापि”। *Also MN on Ku. II. 30.* **6**. **त्वन्मतिः केवला** &c.—The kingdom is well governed by the king if he is assisted by his minister. Cf. 'सदानुकूलेषु हि कुर्वते रतिं नृपेष्वमात्येषु च सर्वसपदः'—*Ki. 1. 5*. Also *MS. VII. 36-37*. But in this particular case the king is engaged elsewhere, hence the minister has alone to carry on the work. परि+पाmeans *'to protect'.* Cf.“क्लिश्यति लब्ध–परिपालन–वृत्तिरेव”—*S'ak. V. 6 ;PN. I. 20;* *MM. X. 25;Y. I. 334 ; MS. IX. 251 ;***प्रतिपालयतु**(*B*) is not good, for, 'प्रति+पा' means '*to await*.' Cf. 'प्रतिपाल्यावसरः खलु प्रस्तावः'—*S'ak*. *VII; 187n. 4*.

 **Remark**:—The students should note carefully that forms like **ह्मि**, **अह्मेषु, अह्मे**, **विह्मरिदो,** **अब्बह्मण्णम्** etc. as found in many printed books and commentaries are erroneous, for in Sanskrit combinations like, ह्न, ह्ल, ह्म when rendered into Prākṛta, न, ल, म will have the upper or the first position by the rule "ह्न–ह्ल–ह्मां न–ल–मां स्थितिरूर्ध्वम्"—Prākṛta Prakāśa, III. 8. Read—"एषु संयोगेषु अधः स्थितानां न-ल-मामित्येतेषां वर्णानां हकारस्य स्थितिरुर्ध्वं भवति। संयोगवर्णयोः परिवृत्तिर्भवतीत्यर्थः”। Sañjivanīthereon ; “एषु संयोगेषु हस्य अधःस्थितानां लादीनां तदुपरि स्थितिः स्यात्।

 **Time-analysis of Act VI :—**A long interval of about six years or so separates the sixth Act from the previous one. This we infer from the following considerations:—(*i*) The interval between Acts VI and VII is very short, and not more than a day. \['देवा एव तथा ![](../books_images/U-IMG-1736187444Capture2.PNG) ![](../books_images/U-IMG-1736187444Capture2.PNG) यथा अचिरेण धर्मपत्नीम्' &c—Act VI also Time-analysis of Act VII.\] (*ii*) From the childish pranksand talks of सर्वदमन, his age seems to be six years or so. (*iii*) According to the Mahã also सर्वदमन is six years old. ('षड्वर्ष एव वालः स कण्वाश्रमदं प्रति। ![](../books_images/U-IMG-1736187444Capture2.PNG)![](../books_images/U-IMG-1736187444Capture2.PNG))।The induction begins in the morning. The fisherman was perhaps caught at 8 or 9 A. M. (*i. e. in the market-time*) in a suburban high street where he was wandering over the market place for a buyer for the ring (188n. 3). Later on he was dragged all the way up to the wicket of the city-gate. Several hours may be supposed to have passed between Śyāla's going to and returning from the palace with gift. \['जानुक, चिरयति खलु आवुत्तः'। 'ननु अवसरोपसर्पणीया राजानः'\]।Most likely the scene ended in the evening when the party proceeded towards a vintner's shop. \['तत् शौण्डिकापणमेव गच्छामः'\]। The act proper begins in the morning, and Sānumatīafter finishing her attendance to the *morning* ablution of the sages (perhaps worshipping the sun ; Cf. 'असरो-वारपर्यायेण इह भगवतः सूर्यस्य पादमूलोपस्थाने वर्तमाना' &c.—*Vik. Act. IV*.) met the maid-servants of the king not later than



10 A. M The worshipping of Kāmadeva is also in keeping with this time. The king kept late hours in the previous night, and consequently having got up late (*198n. 6*)could not attend the *morning* court in time. \[Cf. 'उत्थाय पश्चिमे यामे कृतशौचः समाहितः ![](../books_images/U-IMG-1736187444Capture2.PNG)

![](../books_images/U-IMG-1736187444Capture2.PNG)

प्रविशेत् सा शुभां सभाम्'—*MS. VII. 145*; *183n.* *Time Analysis*). Hence he informs the minister to send all the cases that have been investigated, on paper. The conversation of the king with Vidūṣaka continued for a long period when Vidūṣaka was pinched with hunger ('कथं बुभुक्षया खादितव्योऽस्मि'—VI. pp. 176). Hence the act perhaps closes not later than two in the afternoon. The season is spring and about two weeks' time may be supposed to intervene between the Induction and the main Act before the pangs of love could have produced such aremarkable change in the king's mind and person (*S'l. 6*). Śak-affair has also by this time been thoroughly public ('बहुलीभूतमेतत् किं न कथ्यते'—VI. pp. 135.)

 **228n**.—**1**. **मघवतः**—(226n, 4.) may be connected with both ‘अनुष्ठित-निदेशः' (अनुष्ठित-मघवन्निदेशः) and 'सत्क्रियाविशेषात्' by मध्यमणि-न्याय \[A brilliant gem placed in the middle of a necklace, enhances its beauty on both sides.\] or by देहली-दीपक न्याय \[A lamp hanging over the thresh-hold (देहली) of a house, by its peculiar position, serves to light the rooms on both sides of the thresh-hold\], or by काकाक्षि—



गोलक-न्याय \[A crow (एकाक्ष) serves its purpose by moving its one pupil, as occasion requires from one socket to another\]. Here one word serves two purposes. The construction is justified by 'खापेक्ष-त्वेऽपि गमकत्वात् समासः'। Read 'संबन्धिशब्दः सापेक्ष; नित्यंसर्वः समस्यते। वाक्यवत् सा व्यपेक्षा हि वृत्तावपि न हीयते॥ *9n, 7.* **2**. **सत्क्रियाविशेषाद्—**Owing to extraordinary or special mark of distinction. *33n, 2.* **3**. **उभयत्र** &c.—This is the *best* reading. In the other reading \['उभयमप्यपरितोषंसमर्थये' unnecessarily repeated, sounds *un-kālidāsian*. Note also that this word is not only omitted by *K* and *S* but also in some Devanāgara Mss. This raises great doubt about the authenticity of this reading. **4**. **मरुत्वतः—**मरुत् (मृ+उति) means 'gods in general'. Cf. *Ra.* *XII. 101 ;* *VI. I;* 'मरुताम् अमराणाम्'—*MN.* मरुतः सन्ति अस्य इति मरुत्+मतुप \[5. 2. 94.\] = मरुत्+वत् \[म = व by ‘झयः' 8. 2. 10.\] = मरुत्वत् (*Indra*), and not ‘मरुहान्', as तकारान्त word followed by 'मतुप', is a **'भम्'**, and not a पद। "तसो मत्वर्थे' १।४।१९इति भत्वात् जश्त्वाऽभावः”—*BhD*. "मत्वर्थीय-प्रत्यये परे तकारान्त-प्रकृतिः सकारान्त-प्रकृतिश्च भम् उच्यते। (१।४।१८) मरुत्वान्”—*Prabhā.* In the Vedic literature, however, 'मरुत्' means the *'Gods of Storm'* and Indra is called as he accompanied by them, killed his foe *Vṛtra.* In *HV. I.* 3, मरुत्'s are spoken of as the step-brothers of इन्द्र। **5**. **प्रतिपत्या—**Honour, mark of distinction. Cf. *S'ak. IV. 17 ;* *Ra. XIV. 12 ; XV. 22.* 'स्थानप्रतिपत्ति'—*UC. VIl ; 204n, 4.* **6**. **अवदान** &c.—अव+दो (छेदने) (लट् द्यति)। Or from दैप (शोधने। लट दायति)। Or from दाप (छेदने। लट दाति।) with ल्युट्which in all cases, is to be used in भावे or करणे। The word means a *'valarous act', 'act of heroism' (Com.)* 'अवदानं पौरुषम्'—*K.* Cf. “प्रवीणैः संगीयमानः



त्रिपुरावदानः'—*Ku. VII. 48.* 'प्रापत् अस्त्रम् अवदान-तोषितात्'—*Ra. X7. 21.*'वीर्यावदानेषु कृतावमर्षः—*Ki. III. 43*. **'अपदान'—**has the weighty support from Rām. IV. 40 ; VI. 19. Indra has been stunned by your extra-ordinary power Most probably there is *no serious fight* at all. The demons were perhaps vanquished very easily. *Vide S'ak. III. 1 ; also Time-analysis. of Act VII.* **7**. **सत्क्रियामिमाम्—**Refers to honour recently shown to Duṣyanta (*Com.*) 'सत्क्रिया-गुणान्' is the other reading which has been explained as 'सत्क्रिया-विशेषाम्' by *K,* \[as 'गुण' at the end of a compound has the sense of 'विशेष'। Cf. 'सम्भावना-गुणम्' *infra.* Ś1. 4.\] but there is no reason why all on a sudden, *plural number* should be used, as the idea has already been expressed with *singular number.* Cf.

 Mātali :—What forsooth does not Your Long-lived Highness deserve (*at the hands*) of the Lord of the immortals. Remember—The heaven of the pleasure-loving Indra has been rendered free from the plague \[*Lit. thorn*\] of demons by (*these*) two things—by thy flat-jointed arrows now, and by the claws of the Man-lion in days of yore.

 King—Herein the might of the performer of hundred sacrifices (*is*) really to be admired. That delegates succeed in mighty undertakings,—know that (*to be result of*) the condescending grace of (*their*) masters. Could Aruṇa become the dispeller of : (*the nocturnal*) gloom, had not the thousand-rayed (*sun*) placed him in the van (*i. e. voke*) of his chariot ?

 **V. L.**—B & R omit 'नाम' after 'किमिव'। 'सुखपरस्य'—R. B. V. ‘सुरसखस्य’—M; B omits 'स्तुत्यः' and reads 'तत्र' for 'अत्र'।S has 'मा मैवम्' before 'अत्र'। The third line of Śl. 4 is thus found inB & Dr—'किं प्राभविष्यदरुणस्तमसां वधाय'।

It is both singular and plural (*Com*); 'उभये मणयः'—*BM*. “ततृषुश्चोभये भटाः”—*BK.

(*33n, 4*). Same is the case with (मूलविभुजादित्वात् *3. 2. 5* कः) which comes only in the कर्तृवाच्य। Hence *BhD* observes-“तस्मात्—'हलश्च' ३\।३।१२१ इति घञ्। संज्ञापूर्वकत्वात् न गुणः इति व्याख्येयम्”। Next he suggests an alternative—"यद्वा ब्राह्म-वैष्णव-रौद्र-भेदेन सात्त्विक-राजस-तामस भेदेन वा त्रिविधा दिव्यति व्यवहरति प्रकाशते वा (दिवु क्रीड़ा ![](../books_images/U-IMG-1736188659Capture2.PNG) ![](../books_images/U-IMG-1736188659Capture2.PNG) व्यवहार-द्युति ![](../books_images/U-IMG-1736188659Capture2.PNG)![](../books_images/U-IMG-1736188659Capture2.PNG)गतिषु दिवादिः) इति (त्रि + दिव + क) 'इगुपधत्वात्' ३।१।१३५ कः। *MN* has the following :—'तृतीया द्यौः लोकः इति त्रिदिवः स्वर्गः। **वृत्ति-विषये त्रि-शब्दस्य त्रि-भागवत् पुराणर्थत्वम्।** पृषोदरादित्वात् दिव्-शब्दात् अकारागमः। पुंस्त्वं लोकात्”॥ In a compound, a *numeral* is generally used in the sense of an *ordinal* though in form it is *cardinal*. (*72n, 7*). This may do, but *MN unnecessarily* includes it in the *anomalous* पृषोदरादि-list. For दिव also exists as अकारान्त; or proceed thus—त्र्यवयवं दिवम् इति त्रिदिवम् (उत्तरपदलोपी कर्मधारयः)। This is how *JS* explains **'त्रिलोकनाथः'**। Read 'कथं तर्हि, "त्रिलोक-नाथः पितृसद्मगोचर" इति कालिदासः। ![](../books_images/U-IMG-1736188659Capture2.PNG)![](../books_images/U-IMG-1736188659Capture2.PNG)![](../books_images/U-IMG-1736188659Capture2.PNG)त्र्यवयववो लोकः त्रिलोकः। 'शाकपार्थिवादित्वात् उत्तर-पद-लोपः'—*T*.'त्रिदिव' is ordinarily *masculine*, though its *neuter* use is not rare.Cf. 'त्रिदिवं तु खे स्वर्गे च त्रिदिवा नद्याम्' इति मेदिनी-दर्शनात् क्लीवेऽपि॥—*BhD*. Here 'मेदिनी' is a *slip* for 'हेम'। 229n, 2. **अधुना**—Either *(i)* इदम् + धुना = अ + धुना ('इदम्' changed to 'अ') = अधुना। Or *(ii)* इदम् + अधुना ('इदम्' is elided). Both to be regulated by 'अधुना' *5. 3. 17.* Read “अधुनेति किं निपात्यते? इदमः अश्भावः, धुना च प्रत्ययः *(i)*; इदमो वा लोपः, अधुना च प्रत्ययः *(ii)*; अस्मिन् काले अधुना”—*MBh*. 4. **पुरुष-केसरिणः** &c.—*6n, 2*.

'ज' is not changed into ‘ग’ by “प्रयोज्य-नियोज्यौ शक्यार्थे” 7. 3. 68 ; Read 'प्रयोक्तुं शक्यः प्रयोज्यः, नियोक्तुं शक्यः नियोज्यः भृत्यः'—*SK. 2884*. “अन्यथा प्रयोग्यः, नियोग्यः”—*Prabhā*. **7**. **सम्भावना-गुणम्** &c.—The king means to say that he has no doubt been victorious in the battle but this is really the effect of the greatness of Indra. *V* and *M* take संभावना in the sense of 'योगताऽध्यवसाय' *i. e. the word means supposition or expectation in the power or ability of another to perform any action-S'. C. Vasu's (SK. pp. 702.)* Cf. “संभावनं क्रियासु योगताऽध्यवसायः”—T on 2811 ; also *MN qtd 198n, 7*. “भवद्भिः संभावनायाः सदृशम्" &c.—*BK. XII. 22*. Indra had made a proper estimation of the king's ability and then entrusted him with the great enterprise. Thus according to them, if Indra had not condescended to entrust him with the aforesaid business, he would not have been able to show his prowess and valour. Hence Indra's estimation or expectation (संभावना) is the real cause of the defeat of the demons. Like all great men Duṣyanta is extremely modest. Kālidāsa has elsewhere expressed the same idea in different ways—"ननु वज्रिण एव वीर्यमेतत् विजयन्ते द्विषतो यदस्याः पक्ष्याः। वसुधाधरकन्दरात् विसर्पी प्रतिशब्दोऽहि-

** 232n.—1. कतमस्मिन् मरुतां पथि—**The king ashamed of the continued eulogy of Mātali ; hence with a view to avoiding it, he takes up a quite different topic—R. The ethereal region is divided into seven paths (Cf. Ra. XIII. 19.) each having a particular wind assigned to it. These have been classified by Siddhānta S'iromani thus:—'भू-वायुरावह इह प्रवहस्तदूर्ध्वं स्यात् उद्दह स्तदनु संवहसंज्ञकश्च। अन्यस्ततोऽपि सुबहःपरिपूर्वकोऽस्मादबाह्यः परावह इमे पवनाः प्रसिद्धाः॥ From VaP (Ch. 67. 110. Mq. v.) we find that the first is identical with भूवर्लोकः‚or atmospheric region extending from भूर्लोकः, or terrestrial region, (comprising the earth and the अधोलोकःcalled पाताल,) upwards to the sun. The second is the मार्गof the sun; third, that of the moon; fourth, that of the lunar constellations; fifth, that of the planets; sixth, that of the Great Bear (सप्तर्षि)। seventh, that of the pole-star. But this arrangement of the position of the wind



is slightly different in different Puranās. The king wants to know in which of these paths (कतमस्मिन् पथि) they were then traversing. As the paths are many, therefore **‘कतमस्मिन्'** is better than **'कतरस्मिन्'।** But M, biassed as he is towards the Devanāgara readings, (200n, 1. middle) argues “sometimes कतर is used for कतम,” but this is **inaccurate,** as far as the writings of Kāli are concerned. Cf. 'मातले, कतमोऽयं पूर्वापरसमुद्रावगाढ़' *&c.—Infra*; 'मातले, कतमस्मिन् प्रदेशे मारीचाश्रमः'—*Infra.* 'कतमोराजर्षिवंशः कतमो वा'—Act. I; 'कतमा तत्रभवती शकुन्तला, कतमां तर्कयसि’—Act. VI 'कतमत् प्रकरणं'—6n. 4. **2**. **त्रिस्रोतसम्—**(Ra. XVI.34; Ku.VII.15). The Ganges is so called as it has three courses, viz. मन्दाकिनी in heaven, गङ्गा in the earth, and भोगवती in 'पाताल' (Com.) Here it refers to the first course. Read "प्रधानधारा या स्वर्गे सा च मन्दाकिनी स्मृता। योजनाऽयुत-विस्तीर्णा प्रस्थेन योजना स्मृता॥ क्षीरतुल्यजला शश्वद् अत्युत्तुङ्गतरङ्गिणी। वैकुण्ठाद्ब्रह्मलोकञ्च ततः स्वर्गं समागता—BRP. (जाह्नवीजन्म-प्रस्तावे ३४ अध्यायः)। मन्दाकिनी, however, is identified with the Galaxy or Milky-way. **3. प्रविभक्त-रश्मि—**An adverbial compound (Com.) 'रश्मि' means both 'rein' and 'ray'. Cf. 'रश्मिः पुमान् दीधितौ स्यात् पक्ष-प्रग्रहयोरपि'—Medini. The idea is:—Like a charioteer with reins in hand, the प्रवह wind with due distribution of rays to the various luminaries, makes them revolve (ज्योतींषि वर्तयति)। **4.** **व्यपेत-रजसः—**'रजस्' also means both 'quality' and 'dust' (Com.). The path is free from 'रजोगुण' owing to the sacred touch of the foot of Lord Hari and also to its connection with the celestial Ganges. And it is also free from dusts as it is far above the dusty earth. (Next). **5.** **प्रवहस्य वायोः—**प्रवह is the second of the seven courses of winds in order of their distance from



this earth. (Note 1.). It makes the luminaries (ज्योतींषि वर्तयति) revolve in due order. “भचक्रं घ्रवयोर्नद्धम् आक्षिप्तं प्रवहानिलैः। पर्येत्यजस्रं सन्नद्धा ग्रहकक्षा यथाक्रमम्”—*Sūrya Siddhānta.* “भूमेर्बहिर्द्वादश-योजनानि भूवायुरत्राऽम्बुदविद्युताद्यम्। तदूर्ध्वगो यः प्रवहः सनित्यंप्रत्यग्गति स्तस्य तु मध्यसंस्था॥ नक्षत्रकक्षाः खचरैः समेता यस्मादतस्तेन समाहतोऽयम्। भ-पञ्जर खेचर-चक्र-युक्तो भ्रमत्यजस्रंप्रवहाऽनिलेन॥—*Siddhānta S'iromani.* "अलातचक्रवद्यान्ति वातचक्रेरितास्तथा। यस्माद्वहति तान् वायुः प्रवहस्तेन संस्मृतः”॥—KP. Ch. 42. 3. 'अलातचक्रवद्यान्ति वातचक्रेरितानि तु। यस्माद् ज्योतींषि वहति प्रवहस्तेन सम्मतः”॥—VP. II. 12, 28. 'यस्मात् ज्योतींषि प्रकर्षेण वहति तेन स वायुः प्रवहः स्मृतः। प्रवहस्य एव भेदाः सर्वे वायुस्कन्धाः'—इति तट्टीका॥ That the car is passing at the time through the course of **'प्रवह' wind** is also corroborated by the fact that the king in his following speech remarks that they have reached the course of **आवह wind** where clouds and lightning occur *(Sl. 7, Infra).* Hence the region above this path must be that of प्रवहwind. But a **fresh difficulty** arises in this explanation, for प्रवहthough causes the *revolution* of the *luminaries,* *(According VāP and Brahmāṇḍa Purāṇaप्रवह makes the sun revolve)* it does not bear celestial Ganges (त्रिस्रोतसम्) along its path. That is the business of the wind **'परिवह',** the reading adopted by *V. R. K. M.* Read "श्रेष्ठः**परिवहो** नाम तेषां वायुपराश्रयः।योऽसौ **विभर्ति** **भगवान् गङ्गामाकाशगोचराम्॥** दिव्यामृतजलां पुण्यां त्रिधा स्वर्गपथे स्थिताम्"*—VāP. Ch. 51, 46-47.* “सप्तर्षिचक्रं स्वर्गङ्गां षष्ठः परिवहस्तथा"—Brahmā*ṇḍ*a Purāna. 'तस्मात् प्रवृत्ता पुण्योदा नदी ह्याकाशगामिनी। सप्तमेन अनिलपथा प्रयाता विमलोदका'॥—*VāP*. But though परिवह bears the celestial Ganges, it causes the **सप्तर्षि** (and not ज्योतींषि) to revolve. Thus none of the **reading is free from objection,** still on the



whole we prefer the reading "प्रवहस्य वायोः", for in the following speech we see clearly that the chariot is moving in the आवहwind or the region of clouds (मेघ-पदवीमवतीर्णाः स्मः)। Therefore naturally the king should speak of प्रवहwind in his *previous* speech. If the reading with परिवह be adopted, then from the sixth (*or seventh according Vayu Purana)* the transition would be all on a sudden to the **second wind,** *(which evidently is not very natural).* M observes:—"We have descended to the path of the clouds i. e. to the atmospheric region between the sun and the earth, the Mārga of the clouds and of the आवह wind. The chariot must, therefore, have *traversed* with the speed of a lightning, the four intervening मार्ग’s of the planets, lunar constellations, the moon and the sun. *If the Bengali reading '*प्रवहस्य' *be adopted, the transition would merely be from one* मार्ग *to the next"* K accepts the reading परिवह, but being conscious of its inconsistency with “ज्योतींषि वर्तयति” explains “ज्योतींषि” as "सप्तर्षीणाम् धिष्ण्यानि", but it is hardly accurate. *N* justifies the anomaly in 'त्रिस्रोतसं वहति' by the following quotation from VāP—“विभज्यमानसलिला तैजसेनाऽनिलेन सा”—1. 42. 'तैजसेन ज्योतिर्वहेण प्रवहेण इति यावत्’॥ In fact all the seven *intervening* winds must have some functions in bearing the Ganges as it comes down from heaven to this world. Perhaps our poet from this consideration connects प्रवह with the bearing of the Ganges. (Cf. 'ये द्वे कालं विधत्तः'—In, 5). Or it may be considered to be a case of *lapsus memoria.* (107n, 6. middle.) 6***.*****द्वितीय-हरि** ***&c***—refers to the *dwarf incarnation* of Viṣṇu (वामनावतार) to humble the pride of Bali, Viṣṇu with a view to succour the oppressed gods, assumed the form of a manakin, went to Bali and begged, as a boon, as much land as



he could pace in three steps. Bali, amused by his form, unhesitatingly acceded to this apparently simple request. But the dwarf in the twinkling of an eye, assumed a gigantic from and covered the entire earth with his first step, and the heaven with the second, and planting the third on Bali's head, sent him and all his legions to the Pātāla and allowed him to be its ruler. Cf. “सर्वेश्वरो विष्णुर्द्वितीयंपदमव्ययम्' &c.—PP. Ch. 40; 'क्रमाकान्त-लोकत्रय'—PC. IV (end) 'वामनरूपेणैव कृत-त्रिपद-विलासेन'— Kād. pp. 338; Rām I. 29.19; IV. 37. 17; VI. 71. 64. Vāmana Purāna, Ch. 79; Ra. XIII. I; XVI. 28. **विक्रम**—foolstep. Cf. ‘गतेषु लीलाञ्चितविक्रमेषु'—Ku. I. 34. 'विक्रमाः पादन्यासाः'—MN. In the ṚV, the three steps of Viṣṇu (i. e, the sun), symbolise its rising. culmination and setting.

 Mātali (*Showing with the hand*)—Behold. (*There*) where quiescent \[*or immovable, stolid. Insensate—Ryder.*\] like the stem of a tree, stands yon sage, staring at the solar orb, with (*his*) frame half-sunk in an ant-hill, (*his)* breast having closely cleaved by a snake-slough, with *(his*) neck pressed hardly by the coil of worn-out creeper-tendrils and bearing a mass of matted hair overspreading (*his*) shoulders and thickly filled with birds' nests.

** 238n.—1. अदिति** &c.—अदिति, wife of Kaśyapa, is the mother of आदित्यऽ (Gods). 235n, 5. **2. स्वर्गादिदमधिकतरं**&c.—Though there is no rule to sanction *ablative* (५मी) in connexion with 'अधिक', *HD* thinks that ५मीand optionally७मी too are available with अधिक as *Pānini himself* has used as such in two Sūtras of his अष्टाध्यायी। Read **"यस्मादधिकं”** (२।३।९), **“तदस्मिन्नधिकम्"** (५।२।४५) इति च निर्देशात् अधिक-शब्दयोगे पर्यायेण सप्तमी-पञ्चम्यौ भवतः—*PM.* Elsewhere he sanctions तृतीया विभक्ति। Read 'अधिका खारीद्रोणेन' इति कर्तरि तृतीयापि भवति'*—Ibid on* 5. 4. 45. BD of course follows suit. It seems however very strange to us that *HD* who is profoundly read in the महाभाष्यshould *overlook* the fact that सप्तमी in 5.2.45. is in अधिकरणे, and not due to the presence of 'अधिक'। Read “यद्यपि तावत् व्यापके वैषयिके वा अधिकरणत्वे सम्भवो नास्ति औपश्लेषिक-मधिकरणंविज्ञास्यते”—MBh. "औपश्लेषिकेऽधिकरणे सप्तमी" इति भाष्यम्। “सामीपिकमधिकरणम्" इति कैयटः—*BM*. pp. 866. Hence HD's view is to be taken with a grain of salt, or we may call these lines spurious. In fact in such cases५मी may be well explained by “पञ्चमीविभक्तेः” 2.3.42. and३या by “हेतौ" 2.3.23. Cf. रामः श्यामात् धनेन गरीयान् (अधिकः) or (प्रकृष्टः) and so on. (103n, 3).



**3. भवान् कथम् &c.—**Are you going to stay in the chariot, or will you accompany ine? The king means to say that in the latter case the steeds may run away with the chariot (*See next*). **4. समय-यन्त्रितः&c.—**(Cf. 'समययन्त्रितः'—Rām. IV. 46-10). Mātali tells the king that the chariot, divine as it is, will not move an inch from where it has stopped. This is because *Kāli,* like *Vālmīki*, believes that all the divine cars such as *'Puṣpaka* and the like, have **tutelary deities** (अधिदेवता) residing on them, and which have the power to *understand the will or the slightest insinuation of the charioteer or the occupant of the car.* Consequently they will rise up in heaven or come down on the earth and stop automatically according to needs. Hence these विमानऽ are termed **'काम-गति'।** Read "एतावदुक्तवति दाशरथौ तदीयामिच्छां विमानम् अधिदेवतया विदित्वा। ज्योतिष्पथादवततार” &c.—*Ra. XIII. 68* “अध्यास्ते कामगति सावरजो विमानम्”*—Ibid 76 ;* 'आत्मचिन्तासुलभंविमानम्'—XIV. 20. 'स तंराजा समारुह्यकामगं वीर्यनिर्जितम् &c. ॥४०॥—*Rām.

We have preferred this reading, because the other one does not *clearly* state why the car *(horses*) will not move when both the king and Mātali will be away. Besides **वयं**(plural) does not sound happy after the singular**(मया)**।

'उषः प्रत्युषसि क्लीवे'—*AK.* But उषस् in the sense of "*deity presiding over dawn* \[*aurora*\] *is feminine*, as is sanctioned by Pānini in his लिङ्गानुशासन। Read 'प्रति-पद्-आपद्-विपत्-सम्पच्छरत्-संसत्-परिषद्-**उषः**-संवित्-क्षुत्-पुत्-मुत्-समिधः'—27. Hence Bhavabhūti writes "जगद्वन्द्यांदेवीम् उषसमिव” (*Now see Com.*) Paṇḍita Tārānātha has included उषस्in the feminine gender in his famous वाचस्पत्य-कोष। S' also takes उषस् (*f*) in the sense of प्रभातकाल and quotes from an *unknown lexicon.* M observes—"It is possible that the feminine noun 'उषा' may form its vowel base. from ‘उषस्’, as 'जरा’ from “जरस्”; Cf. "आपञ्चापि हलन्तानां यथा वाचा, निशा, दिशा”—*Bhāguri*. In fact 'उषस्' though *usually neuter* in *classical Sanskrit*, is always used in the *feminine* in the *Vedas*, and we have many a time noticed *our poet's fancy for archaic forms.* “अवस्युमेव चिन्वतीमघोनी उषाः याति स्वसरस्य पत्नी—*RV. III. 61. 4*; 'अच्छ वः देवीम् उसषम्'—*III. 61. 5 ; 6 ; 7 ;* ‘वि उषाः आवः’—*VII. 75 ;* where *Sāyana* observes **'इयम्** उषाः दिविजाः' &c.—The day was just dawning and hence the petals of the lotus were a little and not fully opened and its interstices in the lower part were not visible (अलक्ष्य-पत्रान्तरम्). The boy also stretched out his palm with fingers upraised, but as the fingers were joined at



their roots by a sort of membrane, the hand thus looked like a partially bloomed lotus, **एक-पङ्कजम्**—एक is added to adapt the simile to the single hand. (*Com.*). **4. इद्ध-रागया**—Suggests that the petals of the lotus, naturally red, were made *extremely* rufescent and hence the comparison with the hand of a चक्रवर्ती (15n. 4.) इन्धी(दीप्तौ)+क्त कर्मणि=इद्धः(संदीपितः) kindled, hence *enhanced*.

** 245n.—1. न शक्य एष विरमयितुम्—**Here the 1st case-ending (प्रथमा) in “एषः" involves knotty points of grammar.Let us explain. The grammarians unanimously opine that the predicate expressed by आख्यात (तिङन्त) is *principal* (प्रधान) and it is subordinate (गौण) when it is incomplete and is expressed by कृदन्त (*such as* क्त्वाच्, णमुल, तुम् &c). But the incomplete verbs depend upon the principal verb to complete the predication. Consequently the syntax should be regulated by the principal verb and not by the subordinate one. So says *HD—*"आख्यान-



पद-वाच्या क्रिया विशेष्यत्वात् प्रधानम्। विशेषणभूता तु अप्रधानम्। तद्द्वारेण तद्विषययोः शक्त्योरपि गुण-प्रधान-भावः। तत्र प्रधानाऽनुवर्तित्वात् गुणानां तन्मुख-प्रेक्षित्वात् तद्विरुद्ध-स्वकार्या-ऽऽरम्भाऽभावात् यथायथंविभक्तिरिति”—*PM.* Hence in the sentence "त्वम् एतम् विरमयितुम् न शक्नुयाः", 'तिङ्' in शक् declares the *nominative* (कर्ता) and तुम् in 'विरम' declares the 'भाव' only. (Cf. "अव्ययकृतोभावे भवन्ति इति वक्तव्यम्”—*Prabhā under 3. 4. 67)*. Hence if this sentence is changed into Passive voice, attaching 'यत्' after 'शक्' *(3. I. 99.)* it is clear that the 'कर्ता' becomes 'अनभिहित' and takes third case-ending ('अनभिहिते कर्तरि करणे च तृतीया स्यात्'—*SK. 56I)*; 'एतम्' the object of 'शक्नुयाः' should be ‘अभिहित', but 'तिङ्' being more *powerful,* the case-ending of 'एतम्' should be regulated by the प्रधान क्रिया। Hence it takes प्रथमा ('अभिहिते तु कर्मणि “प्रातिपदिकार्थमात्रे” इति प्रथमैव”—*SK. 537).* Thus we have—“(त्वया) एषः विरमयितुम् न शक्यः”। In a similar way the following uses may be justified—“यत् मूढ़ेन मया ![](../books_images/U-IMG-1735657504Capture2.PNG) ![](../books_images/U-IMG-1735657504Capture2.PNG) (गृहीत्वा) विन्यस्तः त्वयि ![](../books_images/U-IMG-1735657504Capture2.PNG) ![](../books_images/U-IMG-1735657504Capture2.PNG) न तस्याः(करः)”—*Rat. III. 1. Also 86n. I. (end).* But sometimes गुण-क्रिया may get प्राधान्य। This of course will depend upond the sense. In the sentence “पाचकः(ओदनं भोक्तुं) पचति" if the sense is—'the cook cooks ओदन *with a view to eating',* the गुणक्रिया get becomes प्रधान *(the root* पच *being* अविवक्षित-कर्म)। Hence the syntax being regulated by 'तुम्' in the neuter voice (भाववाच्य) weget पाचकेन पच्यते (ओदनं भोक्तुम्)। The *optional* nature of the case is inferred from *VM* using the word 'वा' in the following statement—"तुमर्थाधिकाराच्च सर्व एते भावे प्रत्ययाः। यद्येवं स्वादुकारं भुङ्क्ते देवदत्त इति णमुला कर्तुरनभिहितत्वात् कर्तरि कस्मात् तृतीया न भवति। भुजिप्रत्ययेन अभिहितः कर्ता। न चास्मिन् प्रकरणे शक्ति-शक्तिमतोर्भेदोविवक्ष्यते। समान-कर्तृकत्वं हि

Thus you are going to disgrace your father just as poisonous adder vitiates a sandal tree. 'सर्वभूतेषु यः सम्यक्, ददाति अभयदक्षिणां। हिंसाद्वेष-विमुक्तात्मा स वैधर्म्येण युज्यते&.'—*Mahā. pp. 2001.* With the reading सत्त्वसंश्रयसुखः ; translate—'delighting (सुखयति इति सुखः) in the protection &c'. M reads 'जन्मनः' for 'जन्मदः', and 'संयमः' for 'संयमी' and observes 'जन्मनः the जन्महेतोः इति काटयवेमः। "So प्रभवः=जन्महेतुः(*Vide pp. 113, l. 10*), operative cause of being i. e., a father; otherwise I should translate *"from thy birth"*—*M*. Evidently he derives'जन्म' with 'मनिन्' in the अपादान-वाच्य। To us, however,'जन्म' ''signifying father, appears to be quite *un-kālidāsian.* The other reading जन्मतःhas been explained byV & R as जन्मतः आरभ्य’—*from his very birth.*But was he defiling it from the *very birth.* Besides the latent implication of this reading is not a happy one. **आश्रम-विरूद्ध** &c.—Cf. "अद्य पुष्पसमिदर्थम् ऋषिकुमारकैः सह गतेन आश्रम-विरुद्धमाचरितम्"—*Vik. Act. V.* **4**. **कृष्ण-सर्प** &c.—It must be noted that 'कृष्णसर्प' is *any poisonous serpent* of any color, and not a black snake.This is acase of 'अविग्रह-नित्यसमासः'। “नित्यसमासः नित्यः समासः यस्य विग्रहो नास्ति”— *MBh.* 'बहलग्रहणंव्यवस्थार्थम्। कचिन्नित्यसमास एव। कृष्णसर्पः—*KV*. In other words, if by the *mere fixation* of विभक्ति, a प्रातिपदिक does not give its true meaning, then it is a case of नित्यसमासः। The converse of this is अनित्य-समासः।—"विभक्ति-

 King (*Aside*)—How strange ! of the same stock as myself ! This is, indeed, why Her Ladyship considers him to *take after* me. *(Aloud)* There is this final race-vow of the descendants of Puru—To them, who in their early life, for the sake of protecting the world, choose a residence in mansions, abounding in \[*or delightful with all\]* the pleasures of senses, the tree-roots become in old age, the (*sole*) dwelling place where the one vow of asceticism is rigidly maintained. But this (*sacred*) place is not accessible to mortals by their own power.

Read 'हञ्जे' वेश्याऽज्जुका तथा'—*VK.* “नाट्योक्तौगणिकाज्जुका”—*AK.* In later lexicon of course the word is found as a synonym of mother. “अज्ज अज्जू च मातरि”—*Des'i-kos' a.* 'अम्बा' isalso sometimes found in books other than *theatrical.* 'तातेन अम्ब विहीनोऽस्मि', 'बालभावेऽहमम्बया' इत्यादौअनाट्योक्तावपि अम्बा-शब्द-प्रयोगः।'तत्रमातः किमसदृशं करणंवचस्ते' इति वेणी-संहारादौ नाट्योक्तावपि मात्रादीनां प्रयोगः।—*RM.* **सदृष्टिक्षेपम्—**The boy glances this way and that way to see if his mother has actually come. **3. अपि नाम**—Vide 28n, 1.

IV. 52.* **4. अन्तिके'**—अन्तिका' is a theatrical term for *'elder sister'* ('भगिनी ज्येष्ठा'*—S'*). Also Com. This is preferred to अज्जुका' (*or* अज्जू), as an unrelated woman should be addressed as 'भगिनी' (37n, 2)। **भद्र-मयूरः**—'भद्र' means *'beautiful', 'lovely'* Cf. *PT. I. 181.* Kāli has used it elsewhere in the sense of *'foremost', 'chief' Cf.* "प्रपच्छ भद्रंविजितारिभद्रः'—*Ra. XIV. 51.* Kāli's boys seem to be very fond of peacock. Read—'कुमारः(आयुः)—तेन हि यः सुप्तवान् मदङ्के शिखण्ड-कण्डूयनो-पलब्धः-सुखः। तंमे जातकलापं प्रेषय शितिकण्ठकंशिखिनम्'—*Vik. V. 13*. **5. नाऽयमत्र-प्रस्ताव** &c.—प्रस्तावः=प्रसङ्गः*An introduction, allusion, reference*—*Apte*. Hence the various incidents direct, or indirect that have occurred since the beginningof his entrance into this penance-grove.—*Vide P. 248n,* 7. All



those incidents have almost persuaded him to believe the boy to be his son, still he is not free from anxiety and hence he fondly hopes (अपि नाम) that this his belief may not be falsified like waters seen in the desert (मृगतृष्णिकेव &c.). **नाम-मात्र-प्रस्ताव**—(R) is rejected as 'अपि नाम' which generally implies *‘inward longing’* (28n, 1; 29n, 1) is not in consonace with 'मे विषादाय कल्पते'। Again he is aware of *many incidents* and not the mention of name only. **मृगतृष्णिकेव**—*210n,* 5.

** प्रथमा**—(विलोक्य। सोद्वेगम्)—**अम्महे, रक्खा-करण्डअं से मणिबन्धे ‍ दीसदि,** \[अम्महे, रक्षा-करण्डकम् अस्य मणिबन्धे न दृश्यते\]। First Hermitess *(Looking agitatedly)*—Dear me! the protecting amulet on his wrist is not seen.

** राजा–आर्ये ! अलमावेगेन। नन्विदमस्य सिंह-शाव-विमर्दात् परिभ्रष्टम्।** (आदातुमिच्छति)। King—Don't be anxious, madam. It has fallen through his scuffle with the lion-cub. *(He wishes to pick it up.)*

(विस्मयादुरो-निहित-हस्ते परस्परमवलोकयतः)। Both—Pray don't ! *(If you)* touch it *(you shall die).* Why ! he has taken *(it)* up *(straight) ? (Astonished they lay their hands on their bosoms and look at each other).*

Of potent virtue, this divine-mighty-herb, named the *"Invincible"*, was given by the almighty Mārica at the time of the natal ceremony of this boy. This, says he, none but his parents or himself, can take it up when dropped on the ground.

** राजा—अथ गृह्णाति ?** King—But if *(any one)* takes it ?

** 250n.—1. रक्षा-करण्डकम्**—‘करण्ड' is *masculine (Com)* and ordinarily means a *little box.* Hence the whole may mean a preservative casket; or a locket, or amulet containing mystical herbs as used by people of those days. Cf. “![](../books_images/U-IMG-1735380271Capture2.PNG)![](../books_images/U-IMG-1735380271Capture2.PNG) मन्त्रकरण्डाकानुवाह। रक्षाप्रतिसरोपेतान्यौषधिसूत्राणि बबन्ध”—*Kād.* K explains it by रक्षागुटिका (a magical ball). “रक्षाकाण्डः(B) रक्षाणार्थमावद्धः समूल-लता-विशेषः।'काण्डो मूलंतरोरपि”—इत्यनेकार्थ-ध्वनि-मञ्जरी—HS.

They had seen many a time that the picker of the amulet, other than the boy's parent, was instantly bitten by a snake. But no such thing happened that time, and hence they lookedat each other in amazement. Thus they were fully convincedthat the stranger was no other than the king Duṣyanta, the father of the boy. This is corroborated by the hermitess's address to the king as “महाराजः”। **उरो-निहित** &c.—This is a peculiar



trait of women in amazed condition. *(Com.)*. **5. जातकर्म-समये** &c.—जातकर्म *(Natal ceremony)* is the fourth of the twelve purificatory rites (संस्कार) and the first after the child's birth. Before the navel string is cut off, the father distributing gold, should see the child's face; and then offering oblation to the various gods, he should give the infant honey and ghee in equal part from a pot of bell-metal (कांस्य) with his right hand *ring-fiinger—Mahā-nirvāna-tantra. Ch, IX. 130—144.* “प्राङ्नाभि-वर्धनात् पुंसो जातकर्मविधीयते। मन्त्रवत् प्राशनंचास्य हिरण्य-मधु-सर्पिषन्”॥—*MS. II. 29; Y. I. II. Ra.

** बालः—मुञ्च मं, मुञ्चमं अम्बाए सआसं गमिस्सं।** \[मुञ्चमां, मुञ्च माम्। अम्बायाः सकाशं गमिष्यामि\]। Boy—Release me, release me, *I'll* go to *(my)* mammy.

** राजा** (सस्मितम्)—**एष विवाद एव मां प्रत्याययति।** King *(With a smile)*—This contradictory statement itself convinces me.

 (ततः प्रविशति एक-वेणीधरा शकुन्तला)। **शकुन्तला** (सवितर्कम्)—**विआरकाले बि पकिदित्थंसव्वदमणस्स ओसहिं सुणिअ ण मे आसा आसि अत्तणोभाअहेएसु। अहवा जह साणुमदीए आचक्खिदं तह सम्भावीअदि एदं** \[विकार-कालेऽपि प्रकृतिस्थां सर्वदमनस्य औषधिंश्रुत्वा न मे आशा आसीत् आत्मनो भागधेयेषु। अथवा यथा सानुमत्या आख्यातं तथा सम्भाव्यते एतत्\]। (परिक्रामति)। *(Then enter S'akuntala, having her braid of hair woven once for all, i.e. wearing the same braid thatwas last**woven before the separation).* Śakuntala *(Thoughtfully)*—Even hearing that S'arvadamana's herb remained in *(its)* natural form at the time of metamorphosis, I had *(still)* no hopes in my own fortune.

** 253n.—1. अनुकूलपरिणामं** &c.—I had been no doubt extremely cruel at the time of your disavowal, still it seems to me



that in the long run, this cruelty has effected a beneficial result.

With *(ii)*, the form becomes **“सुतनुः" ;** and with *(iii)* 'तनू' which is a नदी-संज्ञक word \[by “यू स्त्राख्यौ नदी" 1 4. 3; 303; the compound form with कप्, (by “नट्ट्यतश्च” 5. 4. 153 ) becomes **“सुतनूके”** in the vocative case.In this connexion it must be remembered that with *(i)* i. e. 'सुतनु', we do not get the *feminine affix* **'ऊङ्'** by 'ऊङ् उतः' as it is not expressive of *human genus* “उकारान्त-मानव-जाति-वाचक-शब्दात् परः स्त्रीलिङ्गे ऊङ्-प्रत्ययः स्यात्”—*Prabhā.

Śak has been represented as a typical Hindu woman who always attributes



her sorrows to evil deeds done in previous birth. Cf. 'यो मदर्थे पयोराशिं रुद्धवान् वानरैर्युतः॥ स कथं मां महावीरो निष्पापां रजकोक्तितः। त्यजिष्यति ममैवात्र दैवन्तु प्रतिकूलितम्॥”—*PP. ch. 32, 23-24 ;* 'नित्यंतव पदे रक्तां त्वदुच्छिष्टभुजंहि माम्। भवांस्तत्याज तत् सर्वं मम दैवन्तु कारणम्”—*Ibid. 29*. “कल्पाणबुद्धेरथवा तवायंन कामचारो मयि शङ्कनीयः। ममैव जन्मान्तर-पातकानां विपाक- विस्फूर्जथुरप्रसह्यः*—Ra.

*Ends Well.* The king is vividly reminded of the past scene of Sak's rejection. Cf. 'भेदाद् भ्रुवोः कुटिलयोरतिलोहिताक्ष्या&c.—*V. 23 ; VI. 9.* Hence he *identifies* the present tear (तम्) of Śak with that which (यः पूर्वम्) had arisen at the time of her repudiation. (अत्र पुरातनाऽद्यतनयोः बाष्पयोः एकत्वम् अभेदाऽध्यवसायात्—*A*) just as woes experienced long before are renovated at the sight of dear and near ones. This is how *R* has explained the *significance of the correlatives* (यद्—तद्)। **4. कान्ते**—The king is doing his best to please Śak. कान्ते is suggestive of the *undiminished love of the king* for Śak, while **सुतनु**is suggestive of her *personal beauty.* 'बाष्पम्' (M) causes unnecessarypalillogy and is well rejected. But *M* argues—"The repetition of बाष्पseems at *first* unnecessary, but not if it be borne in mind that बाष्पis properly the *moisture* in the eye (142n, 1) and बाष्पबिन्दु, *the tear-drop when it has left the eye.* **प्रमृज्य**=मृज–लट् मार्ष्टि (७।२।११४) मृष्टः, मृजन्ति मार्जन्ति।

The idea is :—The absence of the ring was not a bar to my recognising you as my husband, but you, on the other hand, without it could not recognise me, as your legally married wife. Thus it is meet that the ring should have a place in the finger of you and not of mine, so that in future you can put a stop to such calamity. Cf. 'तदेषा तवैव कण्ठाभरणंभवतु रत्नावली'—**MK. VI.**

With the change of months, the sun also changes his form, hence this phrase refers to the twelve आदित्य's—the representatives of the sun in the twelve months of the year.

** 261n.—1. एकैकं**—467n, 2. The *abstract* metaphor of 'श्रद्धा' and 'विधि' has also been mentioned in Ra. II. 16. "तां देवता-पित्र-तिथि-क्रियार्थमन्वग्ययौ मध्यमलोकपालः। बभौ च सा तेन सतां मतेन, श्रद्धेव साक्षात् विधिनोपपन्ना”—Kāli must have lived in those days when sacrifices were performed constantly by the पूर्वमिमांसकऽ and the Vedic कर्मकाण्ड (पूर्वमिमांसा) was highly esteemed. **2. त्रितयं समागतम्—**Note the prolepsis, (64n, 2 middle.) and anticipatory use of 'तयप्' \[संख्यायाः अवयवे तयप्” 1843. “द्वि-त्रिभ्यां तयस्य अयज् वा” 1844.\]. It has been used before the three components 'श्रद्धा', 'वित्त' and 'विधि' by their appearance have formed the triad. In this connexion read



the discussions made in *T* for the justification of “मुनि त्रयम्" under 1844.

** 262n.—1. युष्मत्-गोत्रस्य**—'गोत्र' means the first person of a particular class, *(Com.)* hence 'त्वमेव' (कश्यप इत्यर्थः) गोत्रम् (आदिपुरुष इत्यर्थः)। यस्य—of whose race you are the first progenitor. 'युष्मत्सगोत्रस्य *(R)* has been objected to by N, for 'सगोत्र' means समानं गोत्रंयस्य सः, \[समान=स, 6.3. 85\], hence कश्यप being himself a progenitor cannot be said to be possessed of a गोत्र।For षष्ठी 257n, 5. Kaṇva is called काश्यप in Mahā (I. 67) but in the genealogies we do not find his name among the descendants of Kaśyapa. Same is the case in VaP. **2. तच्चित्रमिव** &c.—Because his power of recognizing Śak failed when she had actually presented



herself, but was roused at the finding of the ring given to her. **3**. **यथा गजो** &c.—R construes differently thus:—'समक्षरूपे' (गजे) 'गजः न' वा 'इति संशयः स्यात्'। 'तस्मिन् अपक्रामति सति पदानि भूमौ दृष्ट्वा यथा, (गज एवायम्इति) प्रतीतिः भवेत्'। 'तथाविधः' &c. The meaning is obvious. अति+'क्रम' *generally* in Kāli means *'to disregard' 'neglect'.* \[Cf. 'प्रथितयशसां प्रबन्धान् अतिक्रम्य'—Mālā1. 'किंवा परिजन-मतिक्रम्य भवान् संदिष्टः'—*Ibid. IV.*\], sometimes *‘to cross beyond'*. 'अद्रेरुपतट मतिक्रम्य'—*MD. 58.* 'सोऽतिक्रान्तः'—*Ibid II. 42.* Hence **अपक्रामति** seems to be preferable. **समक्ष** &c.—*1n, 9.* **4. तथाविधो** &c. (254n, 8 end)—Because the king could not recognize Śak ('चिन्तयन्नपि न खलु स्वीकरणमत्रभवत्याः स्मरामि'—Act V. pp. 56) when she was actually present. But when she was passing, the king became doubtful about the correctness of his memory. \[‘सन्दिग्धबुद्धिं मां कुर्वन् अकैतव इवास्याःकोपो लक्ष्यते'—Act V. pp. 72. मूढ़ःस्यामहमेषा'&c.

Next he could remember her as his legally married wife at the finding of the ring \[श्यालः—तस्य दर्शनेन भर्तुरभिमतः जनः स्मारितः'—*VI. pp. 115.* 'कञ्चुकी—यदैव अङ्गुलीयकदर्शनादनुस्मृतं देवेन सत्यमूढपूर्वा मे तत्रभवतीशकुन्तला रहसि &c.—Act VI. pp. 137.\]

 Mārica—Even when Menakā came to Dākṣāyaṇī, bearing Śakuntalā, whose calamity was visible to (Menakā) owing to her desecnt into the *Nymph's shrine,* just then I knew by meditation, that this poor *(girl),* your fellow-worker of piety, had been disavowed by you because of the imprecation of Durbāsās, *(and)* not otherwise. And that was to terminate with the finding of the ring.

But I don't remember myself to have been imprecated. Or perhaps the imprecation was not heard by me with my heart distracted by separation, for I was directed by my friends with great care thus—"In case the king do not recognise you, then show him this ring.”

** 263n.—1. अलम् ०शङ्कया**—करणे ३या।****250n, 2. **'अपचार'** (S) for 'अपराध' gives the same sense. Our poethas already used this word in this book and elsewhere. Cf. 'आहोस्वित् प्रसवो ममापचरितैर्विष्टम्भितो विरुधाम्'—*V. 9; Ra. XV. 47.* But **अपराध** seems to be the *original* reading as it has been used in the previous sentence. i. e. 'प्रत्यादिशन् अपराद्धोऽस्मि' &c. **2. ध्यानादवगतः**—ध्यान=प्रणिधान now see *190n, 7.* The knowledge of Durbāsā's imprecation is a *sine qua non* for the entire and everlasting commingling of the two hearts. As otherwise, the king, unable to account for the past misbehaviour to his legally married wife, would surely feel constant inquietude specially when near his consort whose devotion for him had not a jot diminished even after such a long lapse of time. Śak also though she was united with her husband and was informed of his unaccountable mental infatuation, would surely have perturbed mind, as there was nothing to bar the recurrence of the similar stupor in her husband. And owing to this she requested him to wear the ring to put a stop to such future calamity (Cf. 'नास्य विश्वसिमि। आर्यपुत्र एव एनत् धारयतु' *Supra & notes thereon*). Our poet purposely did not make Śak aware of the curse before her meeting with the king, only to show



that if material love, being purged of all worldly considerations, is transformed into spiritual love, it takes no cognizance of the past deeds, however sinful, and always condones a sinner, who has suffered terribly and is penitent, **3. त्वय्युपपन्नः**—Even (अपि) infatuation was possbile in a person like you. **तपस्विनी**—*126n, **6.*** **सहधर्मचारिणी**—*151n, I*. **4. दिष्ट्या अकारण** &c.—Śak was all the while under the notion that she had been disavowed without any reason. But now from her knowledge of the curse, she is made aware of the whole situation and consequently her mind, free from

inquietude, has become perfectly serene.Thus has been possible a permanent and complete commingling of the two souls. *(Supra)*. Note that this and the previous speech of Mārica are absolutely necessary for the dramatic point of view. **5. न श्रुतः**&c.—In a somewhat similar manner King Dilipa could not hear the curse of Surabhi. *Vide Ra 1.76-78.*

** मारीचः** (शकुन्तलां विलोक्य)—**वत्से ! चरितार्थासिI तदिदानींसहधर्मचारिणं प्रति न त्वया मन्युःकार्यः। पश्य—**

 Mārica *(Looking at S'ākuntalā)***—**My child! Fulfilled is thy object. So you should not now be wroth towards *(thy)* fellow-worker in piety. For**—**You were disavowed when *(your)* husband was rude through the obstruction of memory, by reason of the imprecation; *(his)* gloom *(now)* gone, yours alone *(is)* the mastery *(upon your husband).* An image tells not on the surface of a mirror with *(its)* transparency clogged by dirt, but it gains an easy scope when it is clean.

** Remarks—**Long before the Phoenicians, the Hindus knew the art of making glass, specially looking-glasses which formed a part of their toilette and were designed as ornaments for room. It will be interesting to note that even the word 'काच' for glass, occurs in works considerably over *two thousand* years old.The Singhalies

who borrowed all the arts of civilized life from the Hindus, make mention in the *Dipavans'a* of a *glass pinnacle* placed on the top of the *Hunawelle dagoba* by *Suidaitissa,* brother of *Detugaimuna,* in 200 B. C, and of a *glass mirror* in 300. B C. *(Vide Tennent's Ceylone I, pp. 454.)* *Pliny* describes the glass of India being *superior* to all others from the circumstances of its being made of pounded crystal. *(Lib. XXXVI. 66.)*

** 268n.—1. उपहरामि**—उप+हृ means *'bestow', 'offer'. Cf. Ra. XIV. 19 ; XVI. 80, XVIII.* *12. UC. VII.* Also 'किं ते भूयः पाकशासनः प्रियमुपहरतु'—*Vik. V.* **उपकरोमि** **(R)** is also often met with. Cf. 'चाणक्यः—उच्यतां किं वा भूयः प्रियमुपकरोमि'—*MR. VII ;* 'यौगन्धरायणः—देव, किं ते भूयः प्रियमुपकरोमि'—*Rat. IV ; PC. VI.* It is not easy to find out the real reading. **अतः परमपि** &c.—A very common expression at the end of Sanskrit dramas. Vide Rat, UC & MR. **2**. **तथापीदमस्तु (भरत-वाक्यम्)**—भरत is the renowned sage who was the manager of the gods' drama and the founder of the science of music and dramaturgy. His date must be of hoary antiquity as Kālidāsa has called him मुनि। Cf. “मुनिना भरतेन यः प्रयोगः&c."—*Vik, II. 18.* This celebrated work is known as 'भरतनाट्यशास्त्रम्' which is mainly a metrical composition divided into 38 chapters and deals with rulesand precepts about everything regarding dramatic composition.Hence भरतवाक्यम् is *such an utterance as that sage would recite.* Or, *(ii)* भरतmeans *'an actor' (Com.).* Also “शैलालिनन्तु शैलुषा जायाजीवाः कृशाश्विनः भरता इत्यपि



नटाः”—*AK*. तत् किमित्युदासते भरताः'—*MM. I*. “भवभूतिर्नाम कविः निसर्गसौहृदेन भरतेषु”—*Ibid.* Thus it will form a part of the king's speech. Hence translate :—"Still let there be this prayer of the actors." Or, thirdly the king's speech may be supposed to have finished with 'अस्तु'। Then it may be considered a stage-direction *(as opposed to* नान्दीwhich is uttered in the beginning of प्रस्तावना।) which enjoins all the actors to gather on the stage and recite in a body one or two verses containing expressions of well wishes on the part of the actors in the form of a prayer or blessing. Really this is the wish of the **poet** himself. नट's function is finished with प्रस्तावना, hence it has been substituted by the word भरत (R). **3. प्रवर्तताम्**—Let the chief aim of the kings be directed to the complete satisfaction of the people. \[राजा प्रकृतिरञ्जनात् ; *also 7, 4.*\] Most likely some of the kings of our poet's time were exceptions to this great principle. Cf. 'राजानः क्ष्मां शमित-विविधोपप्लवाः पालयन्तु'—PC. VI. 33 **4. सरस्वती&c**.—Thisinsinuates the predominance of the Buddhists and other sceptics who had no faith in the teachings of the Vedas. Cf. 'त्रिवेदस्य च कर्तारःभण्ड-धूर्त-निशाचराः। जुर्फरी तुर्फरीत्याद्यधार्मिकानां वचः स्मृतम्'॥ The idea hasbeen elsewhere expressed by our poet thus :—'संगतम् श्रीसरस्वत्योर्मूर्तयेऽस्तु सदा सताम्'*—Vik. V.* 24. सरस्वती=वाणी, Originally it referred to a river in कुरूक्षेत्र famous for the seats on its banks, of the earliest Brāhmaṇa thinkers. *Vide Mahā.* शल्यपर्व *ch. 37 et sequentes.* M takes महताम् genitive plural of "मह *(to honour)*+शतृ" In that case श्रुति-महताम् may mean *"of the lovers of literature."* **महीयताम्**—महीङ् is कण्डादि Atmp. and is *intransitive.* 'महीयते पूजां लभते'—*BD*. 'प्रेत्य स्वर्गे महीयते'—*Rām.* The reading **“महीय्यतात्"** being formed in the passive voice unnecessarily gives rise to प्रक्रम-भङ्गदोष। **5. क्षपयतु—**Let further



birth of mine be cancelled by the total removal of non-knowledge *(i e. by the generation* of तत्त्वज्ञान). According to VM such verbs as मिलति *(touches),* क्लवते *(fears),*क्षपयति *(destroys)* and the like, though not found in Pāṇini's धातुपाठ, are considered as *regular* verbs, as the enumerations in the several lists are not meant to be final. "मिलि-क्लवि-क्षपि प्रभृतीनां धातुत्वम्। धातु-गणस्याऽसमाप्तेः"—*KSV. V. II. 2, VM's (214n, 3 middle)* view, however, is open to criticism. The root मिल is actually found as the 1365th root in the तुदादि *Prmp.* list. The rootक्षपि also though not mentioned in the *original* list of फणान्ताः परस्मैपदिनः(2353), has been included in the list by *King Bhoja* “अत्रभोजः। दलि, वलि, स्खलि, रणि, ध्वनि, त्रपि, क्षपयश्चेति पपाठ"—SK ; Bopa-deva also has it in कविकल्पद्रुम। *BhD.* however seems to be of different opinion regardingक्षपि। This we infer from his derivation of 'क्षपा' where he has recourse to the causative form of the root 'क्षै' ('क्षये) (स्वादिगणीय)—'अस्मात् ण्यन्तात् मितः पचाद्यच्'—*BhD.* For similar idea Cf. 'भक्तस्य लोकस्य संसारच्छिदं देहि बोधोदयात्'—PC. IV (end). 'उच्छेदंजन्मनः-कर्तुम् एधि शान्तस्तपोधन'—Ki. XI. 31. **6. नील-लोहितः**—Śiva is so called as he is blue in his throat owing to poison (हलाहल), and is red owing to his matted hair—*VP. VII. 7. 41, 43 ; S'ānti, 284.* “नीलंयेन ममाङ्गंतु रसाक्तं, लोहितंत्विषा। नीललोहित इत्येव ततोऽहं परिकीर्तितः”—*Skanda Purana qtd RM ;* or his neck turned blue owing to a stroke given by Indra with his thunderbolt. “दत्तः प्रहारः कुलिशेन पूर्वं तवेशान सुरराज्ञातिवीर्यः। कण्ठे नैलंतेन ते यत्प्रवृत्तंतस्मात् ख्यातस्त्वंनीलकण्ठेति कल्प्यः”॥ Another version accounts for the blue colour to its being seized by Nārāyana in a duel. (ततः प्रसभमाप्लुत्य रुद्रं विष्णुः सनातनः।जग्राह कण्ठे भगवान् नीलकण्ठस्ततोऽभूत्”)॥ **7 परिगतशक्तिः**—परिगत=manifested all round, accompained by ; शक्ति— *(i)* prowess, energy (ii) उमा (iii) the



active power of a deity, numbering 8, 9 or 50. Hence the two together mean *(i)* whose energy is everywhere manifested *(ii)* accompanied by his wife पार्वती *(iii)* attended by the female divinities (*Cf.* "तं मातरो देवमनुव्रजन्त्यः” &c.—*Ku. VII. 38*. 'यःजयति परिणद्धशक्तिभिः शक्तिनाथः'—*MM. V. 1.* and जगद्धर's *gloss on it.* **8. आत्मभूः—**means 'ब्रह्मा'। Cf. 'ब्रह्मात्मभूः सुरज्येष्ठः'—*AK.* But here (*and also in Ku. Cf*. "सोऽनुमान्य हिमवन्तम् आत्मभूः&c.—*VIII. 21.*) it is used as an epithet of *Siva.* Elsewhere our poet has used it to refer to both Viṣṇu and Brahmā. Cf. “पुरुषमात्मभूवञ्च पतिव्रता &c.—*Ra. XI, 16*. 'यमानन्ति आत्मभूवोऽपि कारणम्'—*Ku V.* 81. From this promiscuous use it is easy to infer *(i)* that our poet had lived long before this word attained संज्ञात्व*(ii)* that he was free from sectarianism and he considered the three deities to be the manifestations of the one Supreme being. (*Cf.* "एकैव मूर्तिर्विभिदे &c.—*Ku. VII. 44; 1n, I. (end). 259n, 5. Intro. p. IV*.

** Time-analysis of Act VII :**—The interval between this and the foregoing act is only *of a day.* So we infer because of the following speech of the king—'मातले'—असुर- सम्प्रहारोत्सुकेन पूर्वेद्यु *(yesterday)* र्दिवमघिरोहता न लक्षितोऽयं प्रदेशो मया।Otherwise we would say that Duṣyanta had stayed in Indrā's place and enjoyed his hospitality for a few days. Hence most probably there was not at all any real fight with the demons and they were vanquished very easily. *(Vide Act. III. 1.)* The king reached the mount Hemakūta in the afternoon (![](../books_images/U-IMG-1735397500Capture2.PNG) ![](../books_images/U-IMG-1735397500Capture2.PNG)कनक-रस-निस्यन्दी सान्ध्य इव मेघपरिघः सानुमानालोक्यते— *Supra.* This is also corroborated by Kaśyapa's lectures on the duties of a पतिव्रता, as such discourses are generally begun in the afternoon, *(240n, 4.)* This time is also in consonance with children's going, out for a walk attended by nurses. \['अये कोनु खल्वयम् अनुबध्यमानः तापसीभ्याम्'*&c. Supra. 241n, 2*\] The act perhaps ended late in the evening.



APPENDIX I

**The Metres Used in The Play**

 Sanskrit Prosody as in Greek has been carried to an extraordinary fineness. The earliest and the most important work in Sanskrit prosody is "पिङ्गलच्छन्दःसूत्रम्" of the sage Piṅgala. The Agni-Purāṇa also gives a complete system of Prosody. There are several other works on the subject such as वृत्तरत्नाकर, छन्दोमञ्जरी, श्रुतबोध (of Kālidāsa ?) वृत्तकौमुदी, वृत्तदर्पण,वाणीभूषण&c. The first three are, however, the more popular works.

 Sanskrit verse is regulated by quantity and not by accent as in English. A stanza (पद्य, श्लोक) consists of four verses (पाद) or feet or quarters, and is either "वृत्त" or "जाति"।The metre of वृत्त is regulated by अक्षरऽ (number and position of syllables) in each पाद or quarter; and that of जाति by मात्राऽ (or the syllabic instants i e., the time taken in pronouncing a short vowel.)

 A वृत्त is divided into three classes (“सममर्धसमंवृत्तं विसमञ्चेति तत् त्रिधा”)॥(i) समवृत्त—in which the construction of the four feet obeys one principal rule and hence the quarters are all similar, e.g. मन्दाक्रान्ता, वसन्ततिलका। (ii) अर्धसमवृत्त—in which the alternate quarters are similar, e. g. पुष्पिताग्रा, वियोगिनी। (iii) विषम—in which the quarters are all dissimilar, e.g. आर्या, उद्गाथा।

 यति is the pause or caesura in a part of a verse at which the reader is required to stop his breath and then proceed on. ("यतिर्जिह्वेष्ट-विश्रामस्थानंकविभिरुच्यते”)।



 A syllable is short (ह्रस्व) or long (गुरु) according as its vowel is short or long. But a short vowel becomes long in prosody when it is followed by अनुस्वार, विसर्ग or by a *conjunct* consonant. The last syllable of a पादis *optionally* long or short according to the exigence of the metre, whatever be its natural length (संयुक्ताद्यं दीर्घं सानुस्वारविसर्गसम्मिश्रम्। विज्ञेयमक्षरं गुरु, पादान्तस्य विकल्पेन॥)

 Three successive syllables form a 'गण' *(triad,)*; a short vowel is marked as![](../books_images/U-IMG-1737977706B-removebg-preview.png), and a long one as—.When expressed in these symbols, the different metres may be exhibited as follows:—

 A long syllable is sometimes denoted by 'ग' and a short one by 'ल'। In जातिच्छन्द one मात्रा (instant) is attached to a short vowel, two to a long vowel and three to a *prolated* (प्लुत) vowel and half मात्रा to a consonant. (“एकमात्रो भवेद् ह्रस्वो, द्विमात्रोदीर्घ उच्यते। त्रिमात्रस्तुप्लुतो ज्ञेयो, व्यञ्चनं चार्धमात्रकम्॥)

 The following are the schemes of metres in this play. यति which

**A Note on the intervocalic ब (b) in Prakrit,  
corresponding to प (p) in Sanskrit.**

 In all the Prakrit passages the intervocalic unaspirated sonant labial ब is uniformly found in the edition of Professor Monier-Williams. This labial ब persists even in the indeclinable बि in Prakrit standing for Sanskrit अपि. The edition of Professor Richard Pischel, on the other hand, discloses in its stead a uniform representation by the fricative liquid ब in consonance with the prescription of the Prakrit grammarians. This discordance, however, stands in need of an explanation, as both the editions are admirably executed by scholars of no mean reputation, possessing no small experience of a truly critical editor, and one cannot but be impressed with the extent of labour, care and attention that the works have exacted from their editors in the collation of the numerous manuscripts consulted.

 Pischel, a Prakrit scholar of unique reputation claiming to have given special attention to the Prakrit passages probably because they are often found regrettably corrupt even in the editions of the savants of the East, delivers himself in the following manner :

"I have given special attention to the Prakrit passages and I trust this edition will contribute to a better knowledge of scenic Prakrit than it has been hitherto possible to acquire."

 Monier-Williams, one of the brightest luminaries of the West in Oriental Culture, having vast materials at his disposal and never shrugging nor shrinking from keeping a constant keen vigil to utilise them for a careful collation of the different manuscripts consulted, himself notes in his preface thus :



"Not a passage was printed without a careful collation of all of them, and the three commentaries were consulted from beginning to end."

 From a close perusal of the texts of these editions, it will appear as almost certain that the readings given by Pischel reveal a strong predilection for grammar, while the readings given by Monier-Williams seem to be based on an outlook of the historical background answering to the reliability of one or the other reading of the different manuscripts.

 In judging the readings of the texts of the ancient authors, specially of poets and playwrights, a mechanical adherence to strictly grammatical forms or to rules of rhetoric, prosody or dramaturgy, is as deceptive as is the blind allegiance to the text, in its entirety, of any particular manuscript, howsoever excellent or useful it might be. Collators of manuscripts best know how the original readings of ancient classics do undergo change of complexion, and sometimes beyond recognition, at the hands of grammarians, rhetoricians, prosodists and lexicographers; how blots or blemishes steal into the manuscripts through the negligence or ignorance of the scribes; how the intrusive hand of the poetasters, deluded by a chimerical and insolent hope of improving the author, inflicts a wound here and there, more serious than the mere negligence or ignorance of the copyists; how archaisms gradually give way to modern manners of expression at the hands of scholiasts long habituated to and well conversant with familiar forms and phraseologies of the modern classics.

 Needless indeed it is to expatiate upon the importance of disproving the idea of oversight or ignorance that may be deemed or apprehended as clustering round the apparently anomalous readings adopted by Monier-Williams. Oversight, which is apt to escape even the most vigilant eye, specially in strain and hurry can hardly be justified by its overwhelming frequency of occurrence. Equally



preposterous it is to throw the present Prakrit anomaly to the account of a bleared vision or an imperfect understanding of the learned editor, with finished equipment, in.respect of a sūtra^(**1**)of simple and universal nature, prescribing the change of intervocalic Sanskrit प to ब in Prakrit. Another sūtra बो बः(Hem. 1. 237 ; Tr. 1. 3. 61), a twin, as it were, in point of operation and application, that can justly be regarded as a double check to guard against the confusion or error apprehended, sets at nought the idea or apprehension of ignorance. Even if we assume or admit here the grammatical defence, not of the usual norm, devised or advised by a staunch votary of grammar, seeking to explain the labial ब in Prakrit for intervocalic Sanskrit प as a loan from Apabhramśa, wherein labial ब generally replaces Sanskrit intervocalic प^(**2**), in deference to the dictum of व्यत्यय[^82]intended or formulated to cover the irregularities admitting of admixture of variety of dialects, it is not to be doubted here that under such circumstances, Monier-Williams has been inclined, as one should be, to value more the outlook of the historical background, as it is more likely to vanish in the treatment of matter in the mould of a mere grammarian.

[^82]: "व्यत्ययश्च Hem 4. 447."

 In fact the change of पto labial ब seems to be an earlier phase of development than its mutation into the fricative liquid ब(v).

**1.** पो बः(Vararuci 2, 15 ; Hemacandra 1. 231 ; Trivikrama 1. 3. 55 ; Lakṣmīdhara p 14 ; Siṃharāja 4. 62).It should be noted here that in one of editions of Kramadīśvara's Prakrit grammar in Devanagari character the sūtra reveals a labial sonant ब, with the explanatory note and the illustrative example in the commentary, both following suit. The edition not being of a highly dependable nature in its reading, the question is one now left reserved for further investigation). Cf. also पस्यवः (Mārkaṇḍeya 2, 14).

 **2.** अनादौस्वरादसंयुक्तानां कखतथपफां गघदधवभाः, Hem. 4. 396.



The strong tendency towards sonantization of the unaspirated surds in the language of the Canonical literature of the Jainas, the collateral forms of the same word in Sanskrit both with पand ब (like कपिल and कबिल), as noticed in द्विरूपकोष, lend support to this view. It is quite likely that Monier-Williams took this kind of mutation of प to बas a case of archaism like other forms such as त्रियंवकं, आस etc. (of course not in Prakrit) noticeable in the works of Kālidāsa. Thisseems to be further corroborated by some of the irregular Prakrit forms found in the works of Bhāsa and Aśvaghoṣa which, though departing from the normal course of the Prakrit grammarians, reveal themselves as clear specimens of an intermediate stage leading to the subsequent evolution of forms unanimously sanctioned by the Prakrit grammarians. This is the main reason why the said readings with the labial ब (b) have been preferred in this edition.

 The introduction of this discourse is intended neither disparage the readings adopted by Pischel nor to avoid queries. from inquisitve corners and censure from superficial critics, but solely to illustrate and account for the unseemly difference in reading uniformly maintained throughout the two editions, where special attention has been given to the careful collation of manuscripts.
