 THE present edition of the Pûrvapîṭhikâ has for its basis a Ms. marked N., which is about 100 years old, and was lent to the editor by Govind Shâstrî Nirantar, of Nasik. A careful collation of Wilson's B. Ms., called in the notes B^(w)., and of a fragment of his A. Ms., designated A^(w)., has been made. Bw. has been written by a Marâṭhâ scribe, and is probably 250 years old. It is preserved in the Library of the India Office and numbered 107.

 A^(w)., which consists of six leaves (fols. 27, 30-34), is a modern transcript, made probably for Professor Wilson's use. The six leaves were found in a copy of Wilson's printed edition of the Daśakumâracharita, belonging to the India Office Library.

 The sources from which the text of the Daśakumâracharita has been taken are:

PREFACE  
TO  
PART I**  
(Second Edition.)

 For the second edition, the Daśakumâracharita of Daṇḍin, with the commentaries of Kavîndra Sarasvatî and Śivarâma, by Messrs. Goḍbole and Parab, has been compared, as well as Professor Târânâth Tarkavâchaspati's annotated edition of 1872, which could be used only for the notes of the first edition.

**DR. PETERSON'S  
PREFACE  
TO  
PART II**  
(*First Edition*.)  
————

 THIS edition of Books IV. to VIII. of the Daśakumâracharita has been prepared, with Dr. Bühler's concurrence, to complete the edition of the work in the Bombay Sanskrit Series. Three manuscripts have been used, **A**, a manuscript in the Bhao Daji Collection of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, written in Śaka 1687, **B** and **C**, two manuscripts in the Bombay Government Collection, dated respectively Samvat 1851 and Samvat 1880. Wilson's (**W**) and Godbole and Parab's (**G**) editions have also been used, and the former has been collated throughout.

 Little is known of the author of the book, Daṇḍin. His date has still to be settled. Wilson placed him in the eleventh century : more recent writers would assign him to the sixth. The older view will, I think, eventually be found to be nearer the truth. At all events, I believe, it can be shown that Daṇḍin is a later writer than Vâmana, who belongs to the eighth century.

 Pischel, who believes that Daṇḍin is older than Vâmana, but admits that this cannot be proved by a comparison of the one writer's Kâvyâdarśa with the other's Kâvyâlaṃkâravṛitti, tells us that Kielhorn had pointed out to him that inKâvyâdarśa,II. 51,

**न लिङ्गवचने भिन्ने न हीनाधिकतापि वा।  
उपमादूषणायालं यत्रोद्वेगो न धीमताम्॥**

 Daṇḍin would appear to be criticising part of Vâmana's rule, Kâvyâlaṃkâravṛitti iv. 2, 8, हीनत्वाधिकत्वलिङ्गवचनभेदासादृश्यासंभवास्तद्दोषाः. It might be conceded to Pischel, that these passages in the two books, if they stood alone, would not necessarily do more than disclose a difference of opinion between Daṇḍin and Vâmana, on matter of common controversy, without being conclusive as to their relative age. But the passages in question do not stand alone. AtKâvyâdarśa II. 358, 359.

**अनन्वयससंदेहावुपमास्वेव दर्शितौ।  
उपमारूपकं चापि रूपकेष्वेव दर्शितम्॥  
उत्प्रेक्षाभेद एवासावुत्प्रेक्षावयवोपि च।**

 I see a clear reference to Vâmana's teaching with regard to the figures of speech which he calls *ananvaya, saṃdeha, upamârûpakam and utprekshâvayava*. For Vâmana these are four separate alaṃkāras requiring separate treatment. Daṇḍin has made the first three fall under his general definition of *upamâ and rûpakam* respectively. But he deems it necessary to note that he has done so. The fourth, says, is a mere variety of *utprekshâ*. He mentions it at all, it is clear, only out of respect for some predecessor. In the present state of our knowledge we must, I submit, take it that that predecessor is Vâmana, and that the असावुत्प्रेक्षावयवःof Kâvyâdarśa II. 359 is a challenge of Vâmana's dictum Kâvyâlaṃk*â*ravṛitti IV. 3, 33, उत्प्रेक्षाहेतुरु त्प्रेक्षावयवः.

 Daṇḍin's contraction of the styles of poetry to two only, the Vaidarbha and the Gauḍa varieties, appears also to me to be a reflection on Vâmana, who recognizes three, the Vaidarbha, Gauḍa and Pâñchâla (Kâvyâd. I. 40-43, Kâvyâl. I. 2, 9-13).\*

 We know from R*â*jaśekhara's verse, Śârṅgadharapaddhati 174

**त्रयोग्नयस्त्रयो देवास्त्रयो वेदास्त्रयो गुणाः।  
त्रयो दण्डिप्रबन्धाश्च त्रिषु लोकेषु विश्रुताः॥**

that Daṇḍin was celebrated as the author of three books. Two are our book and the K*â*vy*â*dar'sa. The third is still to seek. Pischel, who believes that it is the Mṛichchhakaṭikâ, has to deal with an important passage in the beginning of the Kâvyâdarśa, in which Daṇḍin apparently refers to a work on metre by himself called the Chhandovichiti. Daṇḍin's Chhandovichiti, has not come down to us, or has not yet been recovered, and it is evident that there is a prim*â* facie possibility that it may be

 \*Pandit Maheśchandra Nyâyaratna, in his interesting paper in the Proceedings of the Bengal Asiatic Society for 1887, p.193, holds that it is unquestionable that Vâmana is by much the older of the two writers. He does not, however, give his reasons. The Pandit has been before me with the observation that Kâvyâdarśa II. 197,

**अरत्नालोकसंहार्यमवार्यंसूर्यरश्मिभिः।  
दृष्टिरोधकरं यूनां यौवनप्रभवं तमः॥**

is a reminiscence of Bâṇa in Kâdambari, Bombay Edition, p.102, 1. 16. केवलं च निसर्गत एवाभानुभेद्यमरत्नालोकोच्छेद्यमप्रदीपप्रभापनेयमतिगहनं तमो यौवनप्रभवम्. The remarks which follow onthe limpatīva verse were written before I knew of the Pandit's paper, where the same view is taken.

**PETERSON'S PREFACE**

 R*â*jaśekhara's third book, leaving no room for the Mṛichchhakatikâ. Jacobi has taken this view (Indische Studien, XVII. p. 44). Pischel is disposed to think that in the passage in the Kâvyâdarśa Daṇḍinis not referring to a book at all.

  I cannot think that he is right here. In Kâvyâdarśa I. 2. Daṇḍintells us that his book is to be a compendium of previous works on Kâvya based on a wide study of existing poems. In v. 10 he says that his authorities divide kâvyainto two parts, body and soul. By the body of poetry is meant a row of words characterized by meaning of a choice kind. This leads him (v. 11) to the division of the body or material substance of kâvyainto what we call prose (gadyam) and poetry (padyam), and into the sub-division of this latter according as it is measured by syllables or by quantity. He then goes on (v. 11):

**छन्दोविचित्यां सकलस्तत्प्रपञ्चो निदर्शितः।  
सा विद्या नौस्तितीर्षूणां गम्भीरं काव्यस्रागरम्॥**

  "The full exposition of that subject (sc. padyam) has been given in the Chhandovichiti:that science is a ship for those who wish to cross the ocean of poetry." Accordingly, in the Kâvyâdarśa Daṇḍinsays no more about the laws of metre. If I have interpreted the context rightly, it seems clear that Daṇḍin is referring to a book here, as also that he can only be referring to a book of his own composition. For nothing but the fact that he was able to refer to a book of his own could account for Daṇḍin's

omitting from his compendium one half of his subject, as that has just been defined by himself.  
 But while I think it probable that Daṇḍin wrote a Chhandovichiti, as Vâmana had done before him, I cannot hold, with any certainty, with Jacobi that we are to recognize in it the third pillar of his fame. In addition to the reference in the Kâvyâdarśa to the Chhandovichiti as a book Daṇḍin had written, there is an equally clear reference to a work to be called the Kalâparichchheda, which Daṇḍin intended to write, Kâvyâdarśa III. 171.

**इत्थं कलाचतुःषष्टिविरोधः साधु नीयतां।  
तस्याः कलापरिच्छेदे रूपमाविर्भविष्यति॥**

 If it should turn out that Daṇḍindid not live to write the Kalâparichheda, Jacobi's hypothesis would recover great additional probability. But as matters stand it seems more likely that the Chhandovichiti and the Kalâparichchheda were regarded by Daṇḍinand his admirers as mere appendages to his Kâvyâdarśa, and that neither the one nor the other of them can be the third book, on which, alongside of the KâvyâdarŚa and the Daśakumâracharita, his fame rested. It is still, therefore, necessary to examine Pischel's plea in favour of the Mṛichchhakaṭikâ. It can be shown that his argument will not bear a careful examination of the passages in the Kâvyâdarśa on which it is founded. Daṇḍinrefers twice to the verse, occurring in the Mṛichchhakaṭikâ, लिम्पतीव तमोङ्गानि &c. If the second reference stood alone, and if the verse had not been identified, we might have been unable to say whether it was original or not. For Daṇḍin gives it there, without note or comment, as an instance of a stanza containing two or more figures of speech which are co-ordinate with each other, not subordinate, the one to the other. But he is able to do this only because he has already (II, 226 ff.) referred to, and been at great pains to refute, the opinion of previous writers, that the verse in question consists of *upamâs* only, and not, as Daṇḍin holds, of two *utprekshâs* and one *upamâ.* The passage need not be given at length here. I will only note that Daṇḍin first gives the two examples ( चेतनस्य and अचेतनस्य) required by his two-fold division of *utprekshâ*. He then goes on :

 लिम्पतीव तमोङ्गानि वर्षतीवाञ्जनं नभः।इतीदमपि भूयिष्ठमुत्प्रेक्षालक्षणान्वितम्॥

 This can only mean

 "That (well-known) verse too लिम्पतीव तमोङ्गानि is mostly\* composed of *utprekshâs*."

——————————————————————————————————

 \* भुयिष्टम्. Daṇḍinis referring to the fact that the verse has two utpreksh*â*s as against one upam*â*. Pischel's translation "in a high degree" and Böhtlingk's "durchaus" both seem to miss this point.  

 Böhtlingk takes the view I am urging against Pischel. But his argument that Daṇḍin would hardly have ascribed here a verse of his own to “a (certain) poet,” vv. 223, 225, and even to "a(certain) man"rests on a misconception of the terms so translated, कविना and पुंसा. They have nothing to do with an ascription of authorship, a sense in which the latter of the two would be unique. In the figure *utprekshâ* some one must, by a quaint conceit, represent something as entirely different from what it really is. कविना "the (not a) poet," and पुंसा"the man," i. e. the speaker.Daṇḍin introduces the expressions to drive home the fact that in such verges इवis exactly equal to मन्ये and the like.

 The occurrence in the Kâvyâdarśa of a verse which is taken from the Mṛichchhakaṭikâ is not, it should be observed in passing, without a significance of its own. It does not prove that Daṇḍinwas the author of the play, on the contrary. But it does go to prove that Daṇḍin, who quotes the play, cannot be a very old writer. For the Mṛichchhakaṭikâ belongs to period when people had begun to forget how to write good Sanskrit.

 Dr. Bühler pointed out to me that Mr. Lewis Rice has, Inscriptions from Śravaṇa Belgola, p. 43, brought to light an important passage in which a verse from "Daṇḍin" in praise of a Jain writer Śrîvarddhadeva, author of a Chūḍāmaṇi, is quoted in an inscription which dates from the Śaka year 1050=1128 A. D.  

** य एव उपश्लोकितो दण्डिना**

**जह्नोःकन्यां जटाग्रेण बभार परमेश्वरः।  
श्रीवर्द्धदेव संधत्से जिह्वाग्रेण सरस्वतीम्॥**

 Mr. Rice would use this to help to settle Śrîvarddha's date, and that of various other authors and works that are in the inscription put before his time."Daṇḍinis placed by the best authorities in the 6th century A. D. It follows that Śrîvarddha lived either at or before that period, and that the various authors mentioned above must be understood to have preceded him." It will be evident from what has been already written that these conclusions cannot stand. There is not a shred of evidence to show that Daṇḍinlived in the sixth century. On the contrary it is absolutely certain that he follows Bâṇa, who belongs to the early part of the seventh century; and it is, as I trust, I have shown, very probable that he is later than Vâmana, who belongs to the eighth. If the "Daṇḍin" of this inscription is our Daṇḍin, we are as likely in the end to get at his date through Śrîvarddha's as to be able to determine Śrîvarddha's from his. But I have to close thesetentative remarks with the warning that the Daṇḍin. of this inscription is probably not our author, but another writer of his name, who must be distinguished from him. I mean the author of the Mallikâmâruta, a play written in rivalry of Bhavabhûti's Mâlatîmâdhava, which has been printed in Calcutta, and copies of which are in the India Office Library and British Museum. Burnell has wrongly given the name of the author of that book as Raṅganâtha. That was his father's name, and the line goes up through Śrîkṛishṇa to Gokulanâtha. They belonged to the Tuṇḍîra country, a district near Conjeevaram. All these names, taken from the preface of the Mallikâmâruta, are against the idea that we are dealing here with the author of the Daśakumâracharita; and the style of the book in no way approaches that of our author. We must therefore hold that there were two Daṇḍins, and it seems likely that the Śravaṇa Belgola inscription refers to the younger and less famous one.

**PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION**  
**(Parts I and II together.)**

<MISSING_FIG href="../books_images/U-IMG-1722596457Screenshot2024-07-30115049.png"/>

 The present is a revised edition in one volume ofDaṇḍin's DaŚakumâracharita. Part I, includingthe Púrvapîṭhikâ and the first three Uchchhvâsas of the work proper was edited as No. X of the Bombay Sanskrit Series by the late Dr. G. Bühler, C.I. E., as far back as 1887; Part II, No. XLII including the remaining five Uchchhvâsas was issued by the late Dr.P. Peterson. M.A., in 1891. Since the text of both parts together does not make more than 145 pages, the present edition is issued in a single volume.

 Considerable additions have been made to the notes, and the text has been collated with the more recent editions of the Nirṇayasâgara Press and also a South-Indian recension. The latter contains in several places better readings, which have been adopted.

 In preparing this edition, I am much indebted to Pandit R. V. Krishnamâchârya, Mr. Ramanuja Iyangar, Pandit K. R. Chakravarti and Rao Saheb T. A. Gopinath Rao, M. A., for many valuable suggestions. My acknowledgments are also due to D. R. Bhandarkar, Esquire, M. A., Dr. S. K. Belvalkar and Dr. N. G. Sardesai, Manager, Oriental Books Supplying Agency, Poona,for their kindness in lending me such books as I required from time to time.

**Popularity of the** **work.**

**Paucity of Proseworks.**

 We propose in the sequel to make an attempt to assess the literary **
**merit of the Daśakumâracharita. It will suffice here to state that as a sample of prose composition it has enjoyed a unique popularity. It is difficult to account for this marked favour except onthe ground of the paucity of prose works in Sanskrit.

 2.Bâṇa's हर्षचरित and कादम्बरी and Subandhu's वासवदत्ता are well-known, but are rather much too hard for beginners.

 Dhanapâla's तिलकमञ्जरी, Vâdîbhasiṃha'sगद्यचिन्तामणि and Abhinava-Bhaṭṭa Bâṇa's वीरनारायणचरितम्,a though said to be extant, have not yet found a publisher. भट्टारहरिचन्द्रकाव्यम्, तरङ्गवती and त्रैलोक्यसुन्दरी are known only by name, but have not yet been discovered.

**Easy style of thework.**

 3. Under these circumstances, the Daśakumâracharita has been found handy for beginners at a stage intervening between thePañchatantra or Hitopadeśa on the one hand, and advanced prose works like the Harshacharita and Kâdambarî on the other. This alone can account for the work being prescribed by the Universities of Calcutta and Bombay,and for the issue of selections by the former and the publication of the complete work by the Bombay Educational Department. But this is only one of the reasons of the popularity of the work.

**Degeneracy of taste.**

 4. Appayya Dîkshita, the famous authorof the Kuvalayânanda beguiled his leisure hours by writing an abridgment of the Daśakumâracharita and one Gopinâtha, referred to later on, showed the same partiality to the work about the same time. Very recent times have also found an admirer of this Daṇḍinin Kavimalla **bhaṭṭaHarimalla** of Jeypore, who in 1894 published, among other works, his abridgment of the Púrvapîṭhikâ ( दशकुमारदशा ) in a small brochure entitled “Jayapura-Pancharangam." It is possible that the very questionable taste with which Daṇḍin has dwelt on love scenes, the effrontery and nonchalance with which intrigues in the harem are avowed by the lovers and the utter callousness with which the advances of these princely suitors are encouraged by the ladies of the harem, all these apparently caught on the imagination of these latter-day Pandits and induced them to raise the author to the position of "a prince of poets” !Unless we are prepared to own a degeneracy of taste in recent times, it is hard to justify the estimation in which the work seems to have been held.

**INTRODUCTION**

**THE PÛRVAPÎṬHIKÄ**

———** **

**Daṇḍin'sown workincomplete.**

 5. Daṇḍin's own work, as now extant, has neither a beginning nor an end.The first is supplied by a Pûrvapîṭhikâ or Introductionwhich is believed on very good grounds to be the work of some other hand, and the last by a supplement called “ Śesha" which is known to be the work of a Deccan Pandit by name Chakrapâṇi Dîkshita. There is something suspicious even about the title of the work, since Daṇḍin'sText gives only eight stories and not ten, the remaining two being supplied by the Pûrvapîṭhikâ

**Bhaṭṭa Nārāyaṇā'sPûrvapîṭhikâ.**

 6. The Deccan College Manuscript Library contains another Pûrvapîṭhikâ, No.32, Coll. 1873-74. This is much more concise andconsistent withthe narrative in the text of Daṇḍin'sown work and is now for the first time published as an Appendix to this edition. This Pûrvapîṭhikâ following colophon:—

**भट्टनारायणकृतं पूर्ववृत्तान्तदर्शनम्।  
अप्राप्य दण्डिरचितं हरिशर्मा व्यलीलिखत्॥**

 The first point worth noticing in this colophon is the position of the absolutive अप्राप्य,which can be construed either way, that is, either withभट्टनारायणकृतं पूर्ववृत्तान्तदर्शनम् or with the following expression दण्डिरचितम्. If अप्राप्य be taken with भट्टनारायणकृतम्, it would raise the presumption of this Pûrvapîṭhikâ having been written by Daṇḍinhimself. But if a Pûrvapîṭhikâ was written by the author himself, the question naturally arises “why should Bhaṭṭa Nârâyaṇa have attempted another?” Bâṇa's son completing his father's unfinished work is intelligible enough, but why should a stranger seek to fill up a gap left by another author ? Professor Wilson ventures the conjecture that it “ may be regarded as the work of one of the author's disciples," though be observes at the same time that“ its general congruity with the acknowledged composition of Daṇḍinrenders it not improbably his work." (p. 5, Introduction).

**Pûrvapîțhikâ the work of some other hand.**

 7. Even a cursory examination of the Pûrvapîṭhikâ is, however, sufficient to show that it is not the work of the author of the Daśakumâracharita. Professor Wilson himself admits that “it is less ambitiously written" and adds that “as the incidents related are in one or two cases, briefly repeated in the body of the work and with some contradictions, doubts have been started as to the accuracy of the attribution.” (p. 5 Intro.) Further on at p. 22, in noticing à contradiction between an incident as related in the Pûrvapîțhikâ and in the body of the main work, Professor Wilson remarks that “either the author has been nodding or the Introduction is the work of a different writer who has been heedless or forgetful of the narrative of his predecessor."

**The style inferior.**

 8. Professor Wilson has dismissed the subject of the inferiority of the Pûrvapîṭhikâ with the single remark thatit is “ less ambitiously written.”But´as a matter of fact, it lacks not only the grace and finish, but contains comparatively more unfelicitous and unmeaning compounds and greater transgressions of grammar and idiom than are to be found in the main work. There is, besides, an unevenness in style as between one Uchchhvâsa and another, the fifth reaching a high level of elegance and the first being the most crude---a circumstance which raises a suspicion of even this part of the work having proceeded from different hands.

**Contradictions and repetitions.**

 9. The doubt about the identity of the authorship of these two parts of the work is confirmed by the repetitions and contradictions which disfigure the Pârvapîṭhikâ. The description of the personal charms of Vasumatî on p. 2 and that of Avantisundarî on pp. 25 and 26 of the Pûrvapîțhikâ are evidently faint copies of the word-picture of Kalpa-Sundarî (p. 74 of the text) in the story of Upahâravarmâ.

**Omissions**.

 10. Besides the contradictions noted by Wilson (at p. 22 of his Introduction), we may note that there are omissions also which cause a deal of confusion. In para. 1 (p. 67. 11. 1-2), the daughter of Upahâravarmâ's nurse speaks of certain overtures made to her by a forester (शबर) and of her escape from that plight through the good offices of a follower of the King of Mithilâ, an incident of which there is no trace in the Pûrvapîṭhikâ.

**BhaṭṭaNârâyaṇa's Pûrvapîthikâis more concise and consistent.**

 11. As stated above, the Pûrvapîṭhikâ printed in the Appendix is (1) more concise and (2) more consistent withDaṇḍin's text, both in the order of narration and the nature of incident. The princes introduced to the reader in Bhaṭṭa Nârâyaṇâ's work follow each other in the order of Daṇḍin's text, whereas the accepted Pûrvapîṭhikâ opens with the story of Upahâravarmâ in the place of Apahâravarmâ of the text. Bhaṭṭa Nârâyaṇa's Introduction begins with an account of Somasarmâ, but the Pûrvapîṭhikâ ends with an account of the prince who bore the name of Somadatta.

 Bhaṭṭa Nârâyaṇa gives in a few words the same story which is presented in greater detail in the Pûrvapîṭhikâ, which has been commonly accepted as the composition of Daṇḍin himself, but which would seem at best to have merely obtained his approval. If the two now brought together were carefully compared, it would appear as if some of the disciples of Daṇḍin, as hinted by Professor Wilson, filled in a sketch approved by the author and each one tried his hand according to his own fancy and literary ability, and it is possible that the longest and the one which in any degree made an approach in manner and diction to the composition of the Guru was finally accepted.

**Discrepancies**.

 12. Without some such surmise, it is hard to account for the many discrepancies in detail which a comparison of the two cannot fail to disclose. For instance, we find in Bhaṭṭa Nârâyaṇa's work Matiśarmâ for Sitavarmâ among the King's ministers. So also we find Dharmapâla having only two sons assigned to him, *viz*., Kâmapâla and Sumitra; and Padmodbhava having three instead of two, Sumantra being transferred from Dharmapâla's line of descent. Again, the third minister Matiśarmâ has only two sons instead of three.

 As the story proceeds, we have more minor differences in detail, such as the gift by Śiva of a spear (śula) instead of a mace (gadâ). In the story of Somadatta, Bhaṭṭa Nârâyaṇa speaks of the Brahmin (who presented the foundling) as wandering in the Daṇḍakâ forest instead of on the bank of the Kâverî, hundreds of miles away in the South. So also in the same story we have the mention of Kulûta for Lâṭa. Similarly in the story of Pushpodbhava, the sage introducing the foundling is described by Bhaṭṭa Nârâyaṇa as merely sauntering on the sea-shore, instead of his being represented as returning from his ablutions in the Râmatîrtha, and in the course of the same story Bhaṭṭa Nârâyaṇa mentions only a Yavana-dvîpa instead of Kâla-yavana-dvîpa. These discrepancies in the matter of geographical places are important to show that the mention of places was more a matter of fancy than as resting on any degree of probability. The author of the Pûrvapîṭhikâ never seems to have been troubled with any thought as to the plausibility of his stories; neither the distance from the Vindhyas of the spots at which the foundlings were picked up, nor the fatigue of a long journey over hill and dale, nor the utter helpless and weak condition of the little babes being matters of any consequence.

**Bhaṭṭa Nârâyaṇa's consistency.**

 13. The foundlings introduced in Bhaṭṭa Nârâyaṇa's narrative again follow exactly the order of Daṇḍin's story and the consistency of his brief introduction is clearly established by the circumstance that Pramati is described as the son of Kâmapâla by the YakshiṇîTârâvali in conformity to Daṇḍin's own statement in the Fifth Uchchhvâsa.

 Then again Bhaṭṭa Nârâyaṇa speaks of the recovery of Râjasiṃha's lost kingdom “through the favour of Vâmadeva." This statement is important, because it leaves no room for the *Śesha or Uttarapîṭhikâ*, referred to in para. 5 above. So also the story of Sâmba at p. 27 (11. 18-24) is anticipated by Bhaṭṭa Nârâyaṇa, and Rajahaṃsa is assured by a sage of Râjavâhana's elevation to paramount sovereignty after his captivity for two months. The Purvapîṭhika describes the marriage of Avantisundarî with Râjavâhana as being brought about by a magician, but Bhaṭṭa Nârâyaṇa says that the hero simply found an opportunity of entering the princess' apartment while the magician was exhibiting a thunder-storm.

 Moreover the last two sentences of Bhaṭṭa Nârâyaṇa's Introductions often the abruptness of Daṇḍin's own narrative by the mention of a previous conversation between the lovers and the reference to a Śâstric injunction prescribing a description of the Universe as a means of winning over the affection of a young damsel.

**Bhaṭṭa Nârâyaṇa difficult to identify.**

** **14. It is difficult to say definitely who this Bhaṭṭa Nârâyaṇa was, unless we have incontrovertible evidence to fix the date of the composition of the Daśakumâracharita itself. The Bhaṭṭa Nârâyaṇa of the Veṇî-Saṃhâra seems to be altogether out of the question, since the pedantry and *penchant* for alliteration which distinguish every sentence of this Introduction are hardly in keeping with the style of the Veṇî-Saṃhâra. Aufrecht mentions 29 authors who bore thatname. If not a contemporary’this Bhaṭṭa Nârâyaṇa must have lived at least very near Daṇḍin's own time.

**The S'esha or concluding section.**

 15. Mention has already been made of the concluding part known as ‘Śesha'the work of a Deccan Paṇdit by name Chakrapâṇi Dîkshita, about whom nothing is known. Pandit R. V. Krishnamâchârya, a well-known Sanskrit scholar known as Abhinava-Bâṇa, speaks of a ninth Uchchhvâsa written by one Padmanâbha and published at Madras. Professor Wilson mentions (P. 30 Intro.) a concluding chapter by one Gopînâtha , which the Professor seems to have examined and rejected as being “not of great interest." This Gopînâtha is mentioned by Aufrecht as Gopînâtha Kavirâja and as the author of (1) दशकुमारकथा (A. D. 1677.) and some other works. On the whole, we feel inclined to hold that the Pûrvapîṭhikâ is not the work of Daṇḍin.

 Let us now proceed to a consideration of the work itself.

**DAŚAKUMÂRACHARITA.**

**————**

**( A ) INTERNAL EVIDENCE.**

 16. Who was Daṇḍin, the author of the Daśakumâracharita, is a very hard question to decide, and before we proceed to a discussion of the same, it is necessary to examine the internal evidence afforded by the work itself.

 Such an examination of the work will help us in arriving at some solution of the question of authorship.

**Internal evidence of the Daśakumâracharita.**

 Since Daṇḍin, the author of the Kâvyâdarśa, has been assumed till now to be also the author of the Daśakumâracharita, we propose to conduct our examination of the Daśakumaracharita in the light of the precepts laid down in the Kâvyâdarśa itself. We propose to confine the test to the work proper, leaving out of consideration the Pûrvapîṭhikâ which most scholars concur in ascribing to other hands.

**The essential requisite of good composition.**

 17. The author of the Kâvyâdarśa warns all aspirants to poetic fame against connivance at even the most trivial flaws in composition, and illustrâtes his meaning by comparing even a single fault to “a spot of white leprosy which mars the beauty of the whole person." तदल्पमपि नोपेक्ष्यं काव्ये दुष्टं कथंचन। स्याद्वपुः सुन्दरमपि श्वित्रेणैकेन दुर्भगम्॥ Káv. I. 7.

**Violation of Grammar and idiom.**

 18. With such a general test of good composition before us, is it possible to defend such (**A**) ungrammaticalforms as:—

 (1) चुम्बयितुम् and आलिङ्गयितुम् **p. 34-1. 7-8.**  
 (2) रमेयम् **p. 72–1. 8.**  
 (3) अमुखयिषत **p. 92-1. 8.**  
 (4) आह्लादिषत **p. 92-1. 9.**  
 (5) उपगूह्य **p. 106-1. 8.**  
 (6) आचक्षिषि **p. 128-1. 1**  
 (7) आस्वादयितुम् **p. 133 - 1. 23.**

or such (**B**) ungrammatical constructions as:-

 (1) एनमनुरक्ता **p. 35-1. 12.**  
 (2) अहमाचकमे **p. 81-1. 19.**  
 (3) अहं सस्वजे **p. 139 -1. 24?**

or (**C**) such irregular syntax as in the following sentences :—

 (1) भगवन्तं मरीचि वेशकृच्छ्रादुत्थाय तेनास्मित्वद्दर्शनमवगमितः **p. 64-1.6.**  
 (2) प्रियसखीं दिदृक्षुः प्रियंवदा वसुमतीं सह भर्त्रा पुष्पपुरमगमत्। **P. 66-1. 8.**  
 (3) पुनरहमभिलिख्यात्मनः प्रतिकृतिमस्मत्प्रतिकृतिरमुष्यै नेया। **p. 69-1.11.**  
 (4) मघवतोपि भाग्यवन्तम् **p. 88- 1. 7.**  
 (5) साहमस्मि वो जननी **p. 95-1. 4** ; नः सखी.....कनकलेखा, plural for singular **p. 123- 1. 8.**  
 (6) उपसर्पेयमिति प्राञ्जलिं परिष्वज्य गतासीत्**P. 96 -1. 13.**  
 (7) यद्यस्मि पतिव्रता **p. 140-1. 22**. (Without some such word as वक्तव्यम् ?

or (**D**) such lapses in idiom as:—

 (1) अभिहितनामधेयः **p. 103 -1. 6.**  
 (2) परिव्राज उज्जयिनीम् **p. 116 -1. 9?**

or (**E**) such unfamiliar use of words as:—

 (1) त्वदन्वेषणप्रसृते मित्रगणे **p. 41-1. 1.**  
 (2) त्वया तु राज्ञे प्रेषणीयम् **p. 85-1. 22**. for sending a message.  
 (3) अथेदानीमत्रभवान् प्रविशतु **p.101-1. 5**. for calling on a prince to begin his narrative.  
 (4) चिल्लिकालताम् **p. 121- 1. 14.**  
 (5) क्षुधमतक्षियम् **p. 140-1. 8.**

or (**F**) such misuse of words as:—

 (1) ब्राह्मणब्रुवः**p. 35-1. 12**. as applied to a Kshatriya who pretended to be a Brahmin.  
  (2) अमृत्रfor ‘there' **p. 115-1. 1.**  
 (3) उपरि **p. 117-1. 1** for 'after' without any word to govern.  
 (4)जगदीश**p. 127-1. 21**. for “King of the country”? We have culled these instances of bad grammar and faulty idiom only to show that an authority on Rhetoric to whom even trivial literary blemishes were like 'spots of white leprosy' could not possibly have sinned so grievously in his own composition, knowing that his own work would be cited by others against his own dicta.

 19. Besides all the lapses we have cited above, there is one more specific departure from the precepts of the Kâvyâdarśa. Though as a general

**another departurefrom the rules of thekâvyâdarśa**

rule, Daṇḍin insists upon perspicuity of style ( प्रसादबत् &c. Kâv. I. 45) he considers “elaborateness of style" ( ओजः) as the "soul of prose” ( ओजः समासभूयस्त्वमेतद्वद्यस्य जीवितम् I. 80 ). Now, as a matter offact, the Daśakumâracharita is much easier anddecidedly less elaborate than even the Harshacharita. Except where describing the personal charms of a heroine or some particular pose as in Kandukâvatî's dance (p. 104) or some weird or picturesque scene, he seldom uses long and unwieldy compounds.

 Nor does it appear likely that the author of the Kâvyâdarśa would have indulged in that literary *tour de force* of which the seventh Uchchhvâsa is such a notable example. And what by the way can we say of the motive assigned for resorting to such literary acrobatics ?

**Bad taste.**

 20. Thus far in regard to the mere use of words and expressions;but a more flagrant transgression of the rules laid down in the Kâvyâdarśa is to be found in the manner and matter and in the development of Rasa or Emotion.

 The author of the Kâvyâdarśa was a purist- both in style and sentiment. To him perspicuity of diction was as dear as chastity of thought. His literary taste was as refined as our own and he would not tolerate such words as 'spitting' निष्ठ्युर्तोद्गीर्णवान्तादि गौणवृत्तिव्यपाश्रयात्। अतिसुन्दरमन्यत्र ग्राम्यकक्षां विगाहते॥Kâv. I 95., much less describe one of his heroes as spitting after chewing betel-leaf on a white-washed wall at the foot of the sofa on which he sees his love sleeping. (Vide Daśak. p. 63,11. 6, 7). Though the spit is shown as making on the wall a likeness of a Chakravâka bird, the very idea of spitting did not evidently strike the author of the Daśakumâracharita as vulgar, apart from such a thing being considered an affront to his lady-love.

**Indelicacy.**

 21. The dicta of the Kâvyâdarśa in the matter of expurgating whatever savoured of indelicacy or vulgarity are such as will commend themselves tothe most fastidious critic of the West. For instance, "the delectableness of every expression of thought", says he “depends mainly on the absence of impropriety, whatever embellishments of style may be used to make the meaning attractive." ( कामं सर्वोप्यलङ्कारो रसमर्थे निषिञ्चतु। तथाप्यग्राम्यतैवैनं भारं वहति भूयसा॥Kâv. I. 62. ) Not content with merely a general caveat against impropriety, he illustrates the above rule by condemning even such an apparently harmless sentence as " How dost thou, O Girl!not love me, who love thee? " ( कन्ये कामयमानं मां न त्वं कामयसे कथम्। Kâv. I. 63. )

 Even such a bald or blunt sentence is in his opinion " repellent.” ( इति ग्राम्योयमर्थात्मा वैरस्याय प्रकल्पते )।Ibid. If we place side by side with this dictum the very offensive verse त्वामयमाबद्धाञ्जलि &c., (p. 63-1. 4 Daśak.) can we in our heart of hearts believe that the same Danṇḍin who laid down the rule also composed such a lewd verse ?

 The author of the Kâvyâdarśa is stern in denouneing not only the general meaning of a passage, but even the use of a single indelicate word. For, says he, " there is vulgarity even in the use of a single word if it suggests anything improper ( शब्देऽपि ग्राम्यतास्त्येव सा सभ्येतरकीर्तनात्। Kâv. I. 65 ). " Even an innuendo or equivocation either by the trick of joining words or by implication was abhorrent to him " ( पदसंधानवृत्या वा वाक्यार्थत्वेन वा पुनः। दुष्प्रतीतिकरं ग्राम्यम्।Kâv. I. 66 ). If these canons of good taste were applied to the Daśakumâracharita how can we justify the many improper passages which disfigure the work ? When these passages are carefully considered, the conviction grows upon one that Daṇḍin, so well known and so highly respected as an authority on Rhetoric, could not, without stultifying himself, have so far forgotten his own precepts as to violate in practice what he taught in theory:

**Subject-matter.**

 22. If the diction and style and bad taste of the Daśakumâracharita give the lie direct to the teaching of the Kâvyâdarśa, what can we say of the subject-matter ? Gambling, burglary, murder, impersonation, abduction and illicit love are jointly or severally the predominant incidents in every story and one is surely justified in asking oneself whether the author of the Kâvyâdarśa meant these stories to be a practical illustration of his own precepts. A Kâvya in his opinion should have a good subject ( सदाश्रयम् ) drawn from history or popular tale or from othersources; it should depend upon the fruit of the fourfold objects of life and the hero should be both clever and noble:( इतिहासकथोद्भूतमितरद्वा सदाश्रयम्। चतुर्वर्गफलायत्तं चतुरोदारनायकम्।Kâvyâdarśa 1. 15). Can we say that the stories of the Daśakumâracharita fulfil any one of these conditions ?

 Besides all that we have urged above, a comparison of the Kâvyâdaśa and the Daśakumâracharita brings to light an instance which to us appears to be a clear indication of a non-identity of the authorship of these two works. In the second Parichchheda of the Kâvyâdaśa occurs the following verse:—

**सहिष्ये विरहं नाथ देह्यदृश्याञ्जनंमम।  
यदक्तनेश्त्रां कन्दर्पः प्रहर्ता मां न पश्यति॥**

 At page 105-11. 18-19. ( U. VI. ) of the Daśakumáracharita we have the following sentences:— अस्ति किञ्चिदञ्जनम्। **अनया यदक्तनेत्रया** राजसूनुरुपस्थितो वानरीमिवैनां द्रक्ष्यति।

 It may be noted that the idea in both is the use of a collyrium. In the Kâvyâdarśa, the collyrium is described as making a person "invisible". The Daśakumâracharita carries the idea further and makes the collyrium to have the property of making the person using it "look like an ape.” In the former, the idea is put elegantly and grammatically. In the latter the same is expressed clumsily and ungrammatically. If the author of the former work had also written the latter, would he have thus sinned both against grammar and perspicuity ?

**The author ofKâvyâdarśa is not probably the author of the Daśakumâracharita**

 23. This examination of the Daśakumâracharita with special reference to the Kâvyâdarśa, is to our mind sufficiently strong evidence of the improbability of both these works having proceeded from the same pen. Let us now see if the hypothesis we have attempted to raise can find any support, also from the plot and the general tenour of the work.

**The plot.**

 24. The plot consists of a number of tales loosely strung together with a single thread running through them all, viz., the acquisition of paramount sovereignty. The hero of each story is a friend of Râjavâhana and each one becomes by some means the de facto ruler of a separate kingdom. The means employed in each case are execrable, a violent death of the actual ruler and a clandestine marriage with the Queen or a Princess being the main incidents of each tale. As far as Daṇḍin's own narrative goes, the seven Kumâras who are Râjavâhana's friends and associates lay at the feet of their royal master their own rights as rulers, each one having, in the course of carving out his career, secured a princely spouse. They all unite in assisting Siṃhavarmâ, the King of Aṅga, against Chaṇḍavarmâ, Viceroy of the King of Malwa, and have the honour of meeting their royal master and the satisfaction of receiving his congratulations on their ingenuity and prowess.

**The tenour of the work.**

 25. We have in a previous section referred to the bad taste of the author in reference to the style and sentiment, but our attempt at estimating the literary merit of the work, would be one-sided and incomplete without an examination of its moral tone. Men and women may be wicked and an author may be permitted to paint them as they are in their true colours, but when an author stoops to justify what is immoral, he plays the part of an *advocatus diaboli* and cannot hope to escape censure. For instance, what can we say of an author who ferrets out or invents a story purporting to justify adultery and invokes the blessing of a deity on such unhallowed intercourse (p. 79, 1. 9) ? A mind that could conceive such a situation and a society that applauds such open advocacy of immorality are justly considered to be on the verge of degeneracy.

 26. Prof. Wilson and Mark Collins seem to have attached some importance to the geography of the Daśakumâracharita. We have already referred to the mention of रामतीर्थ, कालयवन and कावेरी in the Pûrvapîṭhikâ. What weight can be attached to the. geographical accuracy of the Pûrvapîṭhikâ, when one considers the description of the Kingdom of उज्जयिनीas सप्तसागरपर्यन्तं महीमण्डलम्( p. 22, 11. 5-6 ) ? Mention is, indeed, made of no less than 18 different countries in the course of Daṇḍin's own narrative, but except in the case of the countries referred to in the Seventh and Eighth Uchchhvâsas, there is nothing to show that the author knew them familiarly. It

 The author of the Kâvyâdarśa is stern in denouncing not only the general meaning of a passage, but even the use of a single indelicate word. For, says he, “there is vulgarity even in the use of a single word if it suggests anything improper ( शब्देऽपि ग्राम्यतास्त्येव सा सभ्येतरकीर्तनात्।Kâv. I. 65 ). “ Even an innuendo or equivocation either by the trick of joining words or by implication was abhorrent to him " (पदसंधानवृत्त्या वा वाक्यार्थत्वेन वा पुनः। दुष्प्रतीतिकरं ग्राम्यम्।Kâv. I. 66 ). If these canons of good taste were applied to the Daśakumâracharita how can we justify the many improper passages which disfigure the work? When these passages are carefully considered, the conviction grows upon one that Daṇḍin, so well known and so highly respected as an authority on Rhetoric, could not, without stultifying himself, have so far forgotten his own precepts as to violate in practice what he taught in theory:

**Subject-matter.**

Can we say that the stories of the Daśakumâracharita fulfil any one of these conditions ?

 Besides all that we have urged above, a comparison of the Kâvyâdarśa and the Daśakumâracharita brings to light an instance which to us appears to be a clear indication of thenon-identity of the authorship of these two works. "In the second Parichchheda of the Kâvyâdarśa occurs the following verse:—

**सहिष्ये विरहं नाथ देह्यदृश्याञ्जनं मम।  
यदक्तनेत्रां कन्दर्पः प्रहर्ता मां न पश्यति॥ II.15.**

 At page 105-11. 18-19. (U. VI. ) of the Daśakumâracharita we have the following sentences:— अस्ति किञ्चिदञ्जनम्। **अनया यदक्तनेत्रया** राजसूनुरुपस्थितो वानरीमिवैनां द्रक्ष्यति।

 It may be noted that the idea in both is the use of a collyrium. In the Kâvyâdarśa, the collyrium is described as making a person "invisible". The Daśakumâracharita carries the idea further and makes the collyrium to have the property of making the person using it "look like an ape.” In the former, the idea is put elegantly and grammatically. In the latter the same is expressed clumsily and ungrammatically. If the author of the former work had also written the latter, would he have thus sinned both against grammar and perspicuity ?

**The author of Kâvyâdarsa is not probably the author of the Daśakumâracharita.**

23. This examination of the Daśakumâracharita with special reference to the Kâvyâdarśa, is to our mind sufficiently strong evidence of the improbability of both these works having proceeded from the same pen. Let us now see if the hypothesis we have attempted to raise can find any support, also from the plot and the general tenour of the work.

**The plot. **

 24. The plot consists of a number of tales loosely strung together with a single thread running through them all, viz., the acquisition of paramount sovereignty. The hero of each story is a friend of Râjavâhana and each one becomes by some means the de facto ruler of a separate kingdom. The means employed in each case are execrable, a violent death of the actual ruler and a clandestine marriage with the Queen or a Princess being the main incidents of each tale.

They all unite in assisting Siṃhavarmâ, the King of Aṅga, against Chaṇḍavarmâ, Viceroy of the King of Malwa, and have the honour of meeting their royal master and the satisfaction of receiving his congratulations on their ingenuity and prowess.

**The tenour of the work.**

25. We have in a previous section referred to the bad taste of the author in reference to the style and sentiment, but our attempt at estimating the literary merit of the work, would be one-sided and incomplete without an examination of its moral tone. Men and women may be wicked and an author may be permitted to paint them as they are in their true colours, but when an author stoops to justify what is immoral, he plays the part of an *advocatusdiaboli* and cannot hope to escape censure. For instance, what can we say of an author who ferrets out or invents a story purporting to justify adultery and invokes the blessing of a deity on such unhallowed intercourse (p. 79, 1. 9)? A mind that could conceive such a situation and a society that applauds such open advocacy of immorality are justly considered to be on the verge of degeneracy.

 26. Prof. Wilson and Mark Collins seem to have attached some importance to the geography of the Daśakumâracharita. We have already referred to the mention of रामतीर्थ, कालयवन and कावेरी in the Pûrvapîțhikâ. What weight can be attached to thegeographical accuracy of the Pûrvapîțhikâ, when one considers the description of the Kingdom of उज्जयिनी as सप्तसागरपर्यन्तं महीमण्डलम् (p. 22, 11. 5-6 ) ?Mention is, indeed, made of no less than 18 different countries in the course of Daṇḍin's own narrative, but except in the case of the countries referred to in the Seventh and Eighth Uchchhvâsas, there is nothing to show that the author knew them familiarly. Itmay be noted that the name ऋषीकas one of the countries mentioned in the south, though mentioned by Varâhamihira, is not found in later authorities.

 27. Notwithstanding all we have said above, it must be conceded that there is a good deal to be said on the bright side, though it cannot redeem the grossness of the picture as a whole.

**The style.**

 The style is generally fluent and the choice of words appropriate and sometimes very charming. Some of his sentences such as (1) आर्याः रूपेणैव परिवृत्तो मम स्वभावः( p. 78, 1. 9); (2) त्वमेवोन्मत्ता यानुन्मत्त इत्युन्मत्तं मुक्तवती ( p. 64, 1. 2 ) &c.. are very pithy and are justly admired.

 The literary *tour de force* which, though not in keeping with the spirit of the Kâvyâdarśa, displays great skill and mastery of vocabulary.

 Along with a plentiful vocabulary and skill in the use of words, the author no doubt possessed considerable imagination and his descriptions of sunrise on pp. 51 and 68 and sunset on pp. 46, 71 and 125 are worthy of praise. So also is the imagery with which he describes the strange apparition which met the gaze of Arthapâla when he was suddenly brought face to face with Maṇikarṇikâin the subterranean chamber, P. 88-89. In fact, it would appear that the author had in him all the making of a good poet but for his erotic tendency. He seems to have specially affected Vâtsyâyana's Kâmasûtra and the Kauṭilîyam. The former gave to his imagination a taint of sensualism and the latter warped his judgment of right and wrong.

 The work on the whole contains evidence sufficient to point to some author other than Daṇḍin of the Kâvyâdarśa and we shall now proceed to some other evidence in the same direction.

**(B) EXTERNAL EVIDENCE.**

**The influence of theKâvyâdarśa discernible Kavirâja Mârga.**

 28. Professor K. B. Pathak at p. 13 of the Introduction to his edition of Nripatuṅga's Kavirâja-Mârga, a Kânarese Work on Alaṃkâra has shown that six verses in Nṛipatuṅga's Kavirâja-Mârga are literal translations of corresponding verses of the Kâvyâdarśa. We give below the name of each of the Alaṃkâra and the reference to both the Kânarese work and the Sanskṛit original side by side:—

[TABLE]

 After quoting these parallel passages Professor Pathak goes on to add (p. 19, Introduction) “that most of the verses in the Third Parichchheda of the Kavirâja-Mârga are either translations or adaptations from the Kâvyâdarśa.”“Nor do we fail,”continues he “to recognise his influence in other parts of the work.”This is convincing evidence of Nṛipatuṅga's familiarity with the Kâvyâdarśa and the debt he owed to the author of the Sanskrit original.

**Absence of mention in the Kavirâja Mârga.**

 29. What is more pertinent to our present inquiry is the question whether any trace of the Daśakumâracharita is found in Nṛipatuṅga's work. Prof. Pathak refers (p. 13) to Nṛipatuṅga's “extolling” Bâṇa's two works, Harshacharita and Kâdambarî, as masterpieces of Sanskrit prose. But there is absolutely no mention of the prose-work of a Sanskrit author from whom he has borrowed so much in his own work on Alaṃkâra. Is it possible that Nṛipatuṅga knew not the Daśakumâracharita or if he did, did he deliberately ignore it? Neither of the two inferences is, we think, justified. To us it appears more likely that the Daśakumâracharita was simply non-existent. This absence of any mention in Nṛipatuṅga's work should also suffice to dispose of the argument that this work was perhaps an earlier production.

**No mention by Nâgavarman.**

 30. Mr. M. A. Râmânuja Iyangar, Kannada Translator, Mysore Educational Department, writing on 3rd July, 1914, says that "Nâgavarmâ an equally good authority on Alaṃkâra of the 12thcentury makes mention of the name of Daṇḍin with Bhâmaha, Rudraṭa and Vâmana, the ancient and eminent authorities on Rhetoric "--a statement also testified to by Prof. Pathak (p. 17) but apparently there is no mention even in Nâgavarma's work of the Daśakumâracharita.

**Chauṇḍarâja'sKannada "Abhinava- Daśakumâracharita" of the 13th century.**

** **31. The evidence adduced till now is all of a negative character, but the Kannada language has happily preserved for us a clue to ascertaining approximately the time of this Daṇḍin. Mr. Râmânuja Iyangar already referred to states that there is a *champu* work in Kânarese called "Abhinava Daśakumâracharite." "The author is one Chauṇḍarâja, probably living at the close of the thirteenth century. He has in the 17th verse of the First Âśvâsa said 'Daṇḍin\* the King of poets composed in Sanskrit a work known as Daśakumâra-

**The Telugu version by Ketana, also in the 13th century.**

 32. Another great scholar, Pandit K. R. Chakravarti, Assistant Kannada Translator, Educational Department, Bangalore, speaks of a Telugu version of the Daśakumâracharita by a Telugu poet named Ketana, who assumed the name अभिनवदण्डी, presumably because he rendered the Sanskrit work of दण्डी into Telugu. He is also said to have flourished in the 13th century.\*

**The Sanskrit original may be assignedto the eleventh century.**

  33. Now the production of two different versions in two sister languages in two contiguous provinces at about the same time, that is, in the thirteenth century seems clearly to point to the composition of the Sanskrit original within about two centuries previous at the best. If therefore we assign this Daṇḍin, the author of the Daśakumâracharita to the eleventh century, we shall not be far from the mark.

**References in Sanskrit works of a laterdate.**

 \* Extract from the Andhra-Daśakumáracharitam:

**कोम्मेवशौरिसूनुनककुण्ठित कीर्तिविलाससमोन्दग,  
द्यम्मुने दण्डचेण्पिन कथाक्रमममोण्पदेनुं गुंभासार्मोदग,  
द्यम्मुनु बद्यमुंचेरय संचितभावरसोदयाभि रामम्मगुनट्  
लुगा दशकुमारचरित्र मुचप्यवूनतिन्।**

Literature in the domain of Alaṃkâra that we have is to be found in the citation of the opening verse of the Pûrvapîṭhikâ( ब्रह्माण्डच्छत्र&c.) without any mention of the author's name in the SarasvatîKaṇṭhâbharaṇa. The verse is ascribed in the Śârṅgadhara-paddhati and also in the Subhâshita-ratna-bhâṇḍâgâra to Daṇḍlin but is not given under that author by Mr. Thomas in his Introduction to the Kavîndravacana-Samuccaya. It is quoted under Âśis as pointed out in our Note to p. 1, 11. If the verse is one of the class designated by the author of the History of Aryan Civilization as floating literature, it may possibly have been adopted as a benedictory verse at the beginning of the Pûrvapîṭhikâ as in the case of the Subhâshita-Prabandha of Bhoja. (Vide Note p. 1, 11.)

 35. Another reference that we have been able to trace is contained in Taruṇa-Vâchaspati's commentary on Kâvyâdarśa I. 28, where that author mentions the Daśakumâracharita asan example of *Prabandhas* which are included under the head of Âkhyânas. This Taruṇa-Vâchaspati is mentioned by Aufrecht as a writer on Alaṃkâra and Prof. Raṅgâchârya considers him an old commentator of some note. No other work by him is known. He seems to us from his style and his way of exposition to be a comparatively late writer.

 One more reference that we have been able to trace is to be found in Pûrṇa-Sarasvati's commentary on Kâlidâsa's Meghadûta I, 31 where in explaining the word 'प्रार्थनाचाटुकारः' Pûrṇa-Sarasvatîquotes त्रिभुवनसर्मयात्रासंहारसंश्रिताभिः कथाभिः प्रत्यानीयमानरागपूरां न्यरूपयत् ( Daśak. p. 38, 1.2). This Pûrṇa-Sarasvatî is not mentioned by Aufrecht. There is no doubt that he is later than Mallinâtha and Pandit R. V. Krishnamâchâriâr, otherwise known as Abhinava-Bâṇa places him in the 17th century.

 There is also a reference of a very late date. Piṅgalârtha-Pradîpa of Sri Lakshmînâtha, noticed by Sir R. G. Bhandarkar at p. Ixxiii in his Report on the Search of Sanskṛit Mss. for the years 1887-1891, mentions a reference in that work to Daśakumâradaśâ under the head of Varṇavṛitti. This पिङ्गलार्थप्रदीप was according to Dr. Kielhorn composed in A. D. 1601. 36. Such references as these, coupled with the circumstance already referred to, viz. that of the composition of abridgments of Daśakumâracharita by Appayya Dîkshita, Gopînâtha Kavirâja and Bhaṭṭa Harimalla bespeak a comparatively late date for the composition of the Daśakumâracharita and support the internal evidence afforded by the text.

**Indications of modernity in the Textitself.**

 37. The Bṛihat-Kathâ of Guṇâdhya is, no doubt, the parent source from which many Sanskrit poets have drawn materials for their compositions;but the author of the Daśakumâracharita is generally believed, and that too with good reasons, to have drawn upon either the Bṛihat-Kathâ-Mañjarî of Kshemendra or the Kathâsarit-sâgara of Somadeva. The story of a boy passed off as a girl (p. 99), the story of Dhûminî (p. 108), that of Nitambavatî (p. 115) and the so-called transformation described at p. 125 seem to be taken from either of these works as we have pointed out in the Notes. We are, however, inclined to hold that the latter work seems the more likely to have been used rather than the former, since there are many expressions, as we have pointed out in theNotes, which seem to have been borrowed directly from that work. Since the main incidents are common to both works, it is difficult to say definitely which work was used. We give below some of the incidents with references to both the works:—

**The Bṛihat-Kathâ-Mañjarî.**

 (1) Three ministers and their sons Mañj. **P. 36, V. 39.**  
 (2) A boy sage carrying a woman to a penance forest where she is delivered of a son, **P. 37, V. 50.**  
 (3) Vindhya-Vâsinî bestowing a sword on a prince, **P. 47, V. 25.**  
 (4) A prostitute's mother remonstrating with her daughter, **P. 52, V. 87.**  
 (5) A magician preparing to offer a Princess as a victim to Chanṇḍikâ, **P. 86, V. 218.**  
 (6) A wife in a previous birth, **P. 107, V. 61.**  
 (7) Sons of the old ministers and companions of the Prince, **P. 113, V. 132-134.**  
 (8) Vidyâdhara prophesying paramount sovereignty to the Prince, **P. 116, V. 15.**

 (9) Aśokadatta snatching an anklet from off the foot of a woman, **P. 126, V.139**

 (10) A prince pursuing a boar goes to the nether world and marries a princess who was in the power of the boar, **P. 133, V. 224.**

 (11) A Bhikshukî employed in winning the affection of a woman, **P. 192, V. 418**

 (12) Sons of ministers raised to their father's offices, **P. 204, V. 560-562.**

 (13) A ship wrecked on the coast of Ceylon, **P. 212, V. 40.**

 (14) A Vidyâdharî cursed by a sage to birth as a mortal, **P. 213, V. 50.**

 The above are instances of such hints as mayhave been borrowed from the Bṛihat-Kathâ-Mañjarî.

 These hints of incidents could as well have been gleaned from the Kathâsaritsâgara. The following references to words and expressions, however, point to that work as the more likely source.

 (1) भित्त्वासुरुङ्गां प्राविक्षत्स तद्राजसुतागृहम्(Kathâ. **P. 337, V. 54**).

 (2) अजीवयत्स्वमांसास्त्रैः**P. 390-391, V. 6.**

 (3) छिन्नहस्तपादचतुष्टयम् **Ibid V. 9.**

 (4) निकृत्तहस्तचरणो **Ibid V. 12.**

 (5) हेमभस्त्रा and हेमभृता दृति **P. 386, V. 28-30.**

 These are casual references; many more can be traced in either work. It is needless to multiply them, since the only point of such a search is to find out the source from which the incidents of the different stories are drawn. The Bṛihat-Kathâ-Mañjarî as well as the Kathâsaritsâgara both belong to the end of the eleventh century and it is a matter of no great importance to determine which of the two works could have furnished the materials.

 38. There is in the last section (**p. 129, l. 11**) it reference to the dynasty of Bhoja ( भोजवंशभूषणम् ) which being complimentary is taken by Prof. Wilson as some evidence of the age in which the Daśakumâracharita was probably written. Wilson doubts the genuineness of this concluding section on the very slender ground of a change of style, but concedes that “if the work be, as it stands, the composition of Daṇḍin, he must have flourished some time after Bhoja—not long however—and in the time of some of his descendants.” To us this last section seems to be the most powerful part of the work and since it is meant to give a résumé of Kauṭilya's scheme of politics, the style naturally undergoes a change suited to the nature of the subject.  
 We feel some hesitation in accepting this reference as pointing definitely to the celebrated King of Dhârâ. What to us appears to be the clear meaning is a reference to the Bhoja dynasty, and since the rulers of Vidarbha have been known to belong to the Bhoja family, the poet has simply given a compliment to the last King as "an ornament to the Bhoja race." Mr. Mark Collins has indeed set up an elaborate plea to show that the Bhojas referred to here must be the Vâkâṭakas. Says Mark Collins (p. 36. of the Geography of the Daśak.) "the use of the name Bhoja which both ( Kâlidâsa and Daṇḍin ) these authors apply to the rulers of this country (Vidarbha) finds an explanation if we assume that they wrote at a time when this dynasty was predominant in the South.” Mr. Collins has, however, assumed that the author of the Kâvyâdarśa also wrote the Daśakumâracharita, a hypothesis which to us appears to be untenable from the internal evidence of the Daśakumâracharita itself and the other data which we have set out at some length in the preceding sections.

 39. Prof. Wilson notices also two more indications of the comparative modernity of the work. Virûpaka in the second Uchchhvâsa (p. 47) repents of having, out of disappointment in love, been a convert to Jainism and longs to return to the orthodox faith. He also notes an allusion to Nâstikas or unbelievers in the orthodox faith at **p. 127, 1. 17.**

 These two references appear to us to point to a time when Jainism was powerful enough to make converts.

 Prof. Wilson also notices (p. 19, Introduction) the incident of the intention to defraud a Yavana merchant of the fair price of a valuable diamond,. (**p. 77, l. 18**). The name of the Yavana merchant in the Bombay recension is Khaniti and it is possibly formed, as hinted in the notes, of the two words खान + इति (खानेति ) which by a slight elongation of the Mâtrâ or mark ove नऽo as to be joined to the perpendicular mâtrâ after खmight have been copied to look as खनिति. If this was so, then Khâna would clearly be an Arabic or Persian name. In the Southern recension, the name of the Yavana trader is written as असभीति which might be असफ्—इति. In éither case, the reference is not to some Greek but to an Arabic or Persian name.

 40.Another allusion to a Yavana trader is found in the Sixth Uchchhvâsa **(p. 106, 1. 24)** where Mitragupta is picked up by a Yavana ship of which Râmeshu was the captain. Though the name cannot be connected with any Arabic or Persian name in familiar use, there is no doubt that he was a Persian, since there is a reference in the next sentence to watering a thousand grape-plants (**p. 107, l. 1**). The use of the word Yavana may, moreover, be noted, since according to Sir R. G. Bhandarkar “the Mahomedans were for some time after the conquest of the country by them called Śakas by some of the Sanskrit writers and the name Yavana to designate them came into more general use afterwards,”(Report for the Search of Sanskrit Manuscripts for the years 1887-1891, p. lxviii). Thus the word Yavana stands not for a Greek but for a Mahomedan.

 41. In addition to these clear indications of modernity, there are casual references to the practices of a degenerate age, interspersed throughout the work. In line 17. p. 96, there is an account of a Brahmin watching a cock-fight. Such cock-fights were well known in Pâlnâd in the Krishna District.

Mr. Robert Sewell describes Nâyakurâla of Gurzâla witnessing a cock-fight (p. vii Appendix to Lists of Antiquities, Madras Vol. I.). At p. xxv. of the same Appendix, is described a male figure having a spear in one hand and a fighting cock in the other. The earliest date assigned to the "Pâlnâti Virula Bhâgavatam" from which the story is taken is 1080-1087 A. D. This reference to a cock-fight while indicating a late date incidentally also points to the Southern Presidency as the land of Daṇḍin's birth.

 42. In line 21, p. 96 there is the use of the word उपहस्तिका, a bag of leather or cloth for holding betel-nut, etc., the ingredients of a ताम्बूल. The practice of habitually chewing betel-leaf is itself very modern and the use of a handy leather bag for carrying the same is still more modern, at least in the case of Brahmins.

 43. So also the mention of चित्रास्तरण for variegated carpets (p. 92.1. 13) and काञ्जनकुङ्कुमकम्बलor saffron-coloured shawls of gold embroidery (p. 138. 1. 21) and also the use of the word भिल्ल unknown to Amarasiṃha and which seems to have been first incorporated by Hemachandra, all these more or less bespeak a comparatively late date. Some well-known Sanskrit scholars see in the last two words of the last line of the opening verse of the Pûrvapîṭhikâ(विबुधद्वेषिणां कालदण्डः) an allusion to the Mahomedan invasion of India.

 44. There is, besides, as we have pointed out in our note on 1. 23, p. 130 some indication, however slight, of the author's having taken his cue in the harangue of Vihârabhadra from Kali's diatribe in the Naishadhîya, Canto xvii, 37-96. The author of the Naishadhîya flourished towards the end of the twelfth century and if it be admitted that the hint for Vihârabhadra's burlesque is taken from the Naishadhîya, this would be an additional ground for assigning the Daśakumâracharita even to the end of the twelfth century.

**Objections answered.**

** **45. A friend urges that the composition of the Daśakumârâcharita could not be placed after the ninth century. because there is a mention at p. 110. l. 5 of कावेरीतीरपत्तनम्, the ancient capital of the Cholas, as in affluent circumstances (?). In the first place, there is nothing in the text to show that the town was then in a flourishing condition. Secondly, has not the author mentioned श्रावस्ती, वलभी, दामलिप्त and even कुसुमपुर itself ? At best the mention of कावेरीतीरपत्तनम् might show his more intimate acquaintance with places in the Southern Presidency.

 46. The same friend also lays some stress on thelate marriage on which the story in the fifth Uchchhvâsa (p. 99, 1. 9) turns. We have already shown that the story is borrowed from the Kathâsaritsâgara and cannot be taken as a reference to any usage of the author's age.

**The Mallikâ-Mârutapossibly borrows incidents from the Daśakumâracharita.**

 47. Among the many Sanskrit authors and poets who signallised their admiration of the Daśakumâracharita may be mentioned Uddaṇḍa Raṅganâtha, the author of the MallikâMâruta, a Sanskrit drama professedly written after Bhavabhûti's Mâlati-Mâdhava. This drama has been ascribed by some to the author of the Daśakumâracharita. There is, indeed, a parallelism in incidents which is well calculated to raise such a presumption and the following enumeration will interest the careful student of the Daśakumâracharita.

(1) The plot of the drama is laid in Kusumapura.  
(2) Mâruta, the hero, received from his father the portrait of a lady which happened to resemble that of Mallikâ, the heroine.  
 (3) While Mâruta is praying to the Goddess Gauri for success in his suit, Mallikâ the heroine happens to drop from the hands of a demon directly into his arms.  
(4) Viśvâvasu, a celestial friend of Mâruta, personates Mallikâ and Kâlakaṇṭha, Mâruta's human friend, assumes the garb of Mandâkinî.  
(5) Kâlakaṇṭha disgusted with life prepares to throw himself from a precipice.  
 (6) A flamingo coursing through the sky drops a necklace which was no other than that worn by the heroine.  
 (7) The daughter of Viśvâvasu is playing with balls before Gauri.  
 (8) Mâruta draws a portrait of his lady-love in the act of playing with balls.  
 (9) A sage curses the hero and heroine to mortal birth.  
 (10) The awakening of a strange consciousness of previous birth and past relations both in the hero and heroine.

**The hypothesis untenable.**  
 48. These points of similarity and the taint of indecency from which the drama is not free (see especially v. 22 of Act viii, p. 244 Jibananda's Edition)must have suggested theascription of the authorshipof this drama to Daṇḍin. But an examination of the style of this drama is sufficient to disprove such identity of the authorship of these two works. The dialogues of the drama present much greater elaboration and consequently are much harder to understand than the simpler prose narrative of the Daśakumâracharita. The verse too is equally rugged, and whosoever reads the two works together cannot fail to be convinced of the groundlessness of the suggested common authorship of these two works. But even without the internal evidence above specified, we have sufficient and very full information supported by tradition among Southern Pandits about the life and times of Uddaṇḍa Raṅganâtha, the author of the Mallikâ-Mâruta.

**Name and date of theauthor of theMallikâ-Mâruta.**

 49. Rao Saheb T. A. Gopinâtha Rao, M.A., Superintendent of Archæology, Trivendram, says "Uddaṇḍa Śâstri was a native of the village called Lâṭapura on the bank of the Pâlaru (Kshiranadî), a place near Kâñchîpura. He was the son of Bhaṭṭa Raṅganâtha and Raṅgâdevî and belonged to the Vâdhûla Gotra and the Âpastamba Sûtra. Though born of a respectable family, the author was a poor man and had as a consequence to seek his fortune in the Ândhra, Karnâṭaka, Kaliṅga, Chola, and Kerala countries. Finally, he attached himself to the Court of the Zamorin, Mâna-Vikrama of Calicut and there he wrote his Mallikâ-Mâruta. He was a contemporary of the author of Tantra-Samuchchaya who lived in the Kollaru era, year 602 (A. D. 1427).” Rao Saheb Gopinâtha Rao adds in a post-script that “many verses and sentiments are common between Kokila-Sandeśa (another work of Uddaṇḍa) and the Mallikâ-Mâruta which should confirm the identity of the Authors of both.”

 The same account is given in Sanskrit in No. 27 of Vol. VI of the Vijñâna Chintâmaṇi, the well-known Sanskrit Magazine conducted by Kerala Panditas.

 50. Now that the time of the composition of the Mallikâ-Mâruta is definitely ascertained, we are justified in counting this Uddaṇḍa among the admirers of the Daśakumâracharita. In fact, it would appear that this Daṇḍin of the Daśakumâracharita whoever he was, jumped into popularity as soon as the Daśakumâracharita came to be known. Poets like Uddaṇḍa copied and incorporated incidents from his work. Commentators like Pûrṇa-Sarasvatî quoted passages from his work and scholars like Appayya Dîkshita charmed away their tedium by composing abridgments of his work.

**Summary.**

 51. We have in the foregoing paragraphs attempted to show that—

(1) The internal evidence of language and subject-matter of the Daśakumâracharita is altogether inconsistent with the teaching of the Kâvyâdarśa and the two works could not have been written by the same author.

 (2) That the Daśakumâracharita was unknown up to the end of the ninth century

 (3) That adaptations of the Sanskrit original in Kanarese and Telugu Languages were produced in the thirteenth century.

 (4) That Sanskrit writers later than the fifteenth century make references to the work or make abridgments of the same.

 The cumulative effect of all these data is to point to the eleventh or twelfth century as the probable date of the composition of the Daśakumâracharita.

**Meaning of Râjaśekhara** **'s couplet.**

 52.This naturally leads us to a consideration of the well-known couplet of Râjaśekhara ascribing three Prabandhas to Daṇḍin. ( त्रयो दण्डिप्रबन्धाश्चत्रिषु लोकेषु विश्रुताः ).

 In the first place, with all due deference to earlier writers on this subject, we demur to the meaning in which the word Prabandha seems to have been taken. A Prabandha is explained in the Kalpadruma as काव्यादिग्रथनम्. In explaining the word प्रबन्धकल्पना (Amara, V. 6) Kshîrasvâmin प्रबन्धस्य कल्पना कादम्बर्यादिरुत्पाद्यत्वात्. Thus according to Kshîrasvâm in,a Prabandha implies some exercise of the creative faculty.As instances of this special meaning ofप्रबन्ध we may refer to the following:—

 (1) अनुज्झितार्थसम्बन्धः प्रबन्धो दुरुदाहरःŚiśupâlavadha, II. 73.

 (2) भाससौमिल्लकविमिश्रादीनां प्रवन्धानतिक्रम्य Malavikâgnimitra, Act I.

 (3) प्रत्यक्षरश्लेषमयप्रपञ्चविन्यासवैदग्ध्यनिधिं प्रवन्धम् Subandhu. But the following two quotations from the Kâvyâdarśa itself will be more convincing :—

 (a) भाविकं तमिति प्राहुः प्रवन्धविषयं गुणम् (KâvyâII. 363).

 (b) एकवाक्ये प्रवन्धे वा पूर्वापरपराहतम् (Ibid. IV. 8.)  
 But better still is the following verse ascribed to Râjaśekhara himself in the Sûkti-Muktâvali (vide p. xi, v. 44 of Sir R. Bhandarkar's Report for 1887-91).

**कालंजरपतिश्चक्रे भीमटः पञ्चनाटकीम्।  
प्राप प्रवन्धराजत्वं तेषु स्वप्नदशाननम्॥**

 It may be seen from this verse that Râjaśekhara uses the word प्रवन्धin the sense of “a poetic composition” and we have therefore the greatest hesitation in including the Kâvyâdarśa, professedly a scientific treatise, among the three works ascribed to Daṇḍin.

 It may also be remembered that Râjaśekhara obviously intended to confer a sort of immortality on poets only, and not on Sanskrit authors generally; for in that case he might have written on authors on Medicine, Astronomy, Rhetoric and other subjects as well. Works on these subjects occasionally present rare specimens of really poetic feeling. He might at least have mentioned the names of Bharata, Bhâmaha, Varâhamihira and a host of others but he has evidently done nothing of the kind. His memorial verses in our humble opinion refer to poets alone and he would not have devoted a verse to Pâṇini, if the latter had not been credited with the authorship of the Jâmbavatijaya. In short, we feel inclined to hold that Râjaśekhara had not the author of the Kâvyâdarśa in his mind—nor is that work a Prabandha in the sense in which the word is used in Poetics.

**Kâvyâdarśa a compilation.**

 53. Nor is this surmise altogether groundless. The author of the Kâvyâdarśa begins his work with an explicit avowal of compiling his work after a close study and critical examination of the usages of earlier poets. (पर्वशास्त्राणि संहृत्य प्रयोगानुपलक्ष्य च I. 2). Further on, he says that they have themselves laid down the rules for that species of composition ( सूरयः। वाचां विचित्रमार्गाणां निबबन्धुः क्रियाविधिम्I. 9) and have also shown the body and the ornaments of poems तैः शरीरं च काव्यानामलङ्काराश्च दर्शिताःI. 10). He makes no secret of his having borrowed his illustrations from earlier poets and actually uses the word कवीनाम् in I. 65, कविना in II. 223, 225, कवयोin IV. 32, कविकौशलान् in IV. 57, besides referring to poets as सूरयः in I. 9, as सद्भिःin II. 56, as तद्विदाम् in II. 54. As an instance of the criticism to which he subjected the poetical concepts of preceding authors, it is sufficient to mention that he has bestowed no less than 8 consecutive verses (II, 226-233) on an examination of the famous verse लिम्पतीव तमोङ्गानि which as far as our present knowledge goes seems first to have been used by Bhâsa in the first Act of both his बालचरित and चारुदत्त ( See T. Gaṇapati Śâstri's Introduction, p. xxiii). As specific instances of what Peterson has called reminiscences, we may add to the one from Bâṇa quoted by Peterson (*vide* p. 3, Preface) इन्दोरिन्दीवरद्युति।लक्ष्म लक्ष्मीं तनोतीति (Kâvya. I, 45) which reminds one of Kâlidâsa's मलिमपि हिमांशोर्लक्ष्मलक्ष्मीं तनोति (Śâkunt. Act 1. 18). Similarly यस्याः कुसुमशय्यापि कोमलाङ्ग्या रुनाकरी।साधिशेते कथं तन्वी हुताशनवतीं चिताम् (Kâvyâ. II. 285) naturally recalls to one's memory the sweet moan of Aja in the Raghuvaṃśa नवपल्लवसंस्तरेपि ते मृदु दूयेत यदङ्गमर्पितम्। तदिदं विषहिष्यते कथं वद वामोरु चिताधिरोहणम् (Raghu. viii. 57). So also प्रभामात्रं हि तरलं दृश्यते न तदाश्रयः(Kâvyâ. II. 129) may have been suggested by Kâlidâsa's न प्रभातरलं ज्योतिरुदेति वसुधातलात् (Śakunt Act I). These are some striking instances of the usages of previous authors, but there are others in which the similarity in thought and expression is less obvious. For instances of this latter kind may be adduced the following;—रवितप्तो गजः पद्मांस्तद्गृह्यान्बाधितुं ध्रुवम्। सरो विशति न स्नातुं गजस्नानं हि निष्फलम्। (Subhâshita-Ratna. p. 242 v. 60) which seems to have prompted Daṇḍin's मध्यन्दिनार्कसन्तप्तः सरसीं गाहते गजः। मन्ये मार्तण्डगृह्याणि पद्मान्युद्धर्तुमुद्यतः(Kâvyâ. II. 222). So also the Subhâshita अमुष्य मुषिता लक्ष्मीश्चक्षुषेति न नूतनम्। न वेद्मि कथयत्यस्याः कर्णेलग्नं किमुत्पलम् ( Subhâshita-Ratna. p. 271, 66 ) has a suspicious resemblance to Daṇḍin's अपाङ्गभागपातिन्या दृष्टेरंशुभिरुत्पलम्। स्पृश्यते वा न वेत्येवं कविनोत्प्रेक्ष्य वर्ण्यते। (Kâvyâ. II. 225 ). The verse मृतेति प्रेत्य संगन्तुं यया मे मरणं मतम्। सैषावन्ती मया लब्धा कथमत्रैव जन्मनि। (Kâvyâ. II. 280) so graphically striking the key-note of the romantic love of Udayana and Vâsavadattâ and so redolent of the sweetness of Bhâsa, but not found in that author's स्वप्नवासवदत्तम्, has been traced to मदालसा by Premachandra Tarka-Vâgîśa‚ the learned Bengali commentator of the Kâvyâdarśa. Taruṇa-Vâchaspatî, the commentator, however distinctly refers this verse to the love between Vatsaraja and Avantî which was another name of Vâsavadattâ (अत्र अवन्तीविषये वत्सराजस्य जाता रतिः.......पुनर्जीवन्त्या दृष्ट्यापुष्टिमानीयमाना शृङ्गाररसतामापाद्यते p. 161, Raṅgâchârya's Edition). So also the verse निगृह्य केशेष्वाकृष्टा कृष्णा येनाग्रतो मम। सोयं दुःशासनः प्राप्तो लब्धः किं जीवति क्षणम्। ( Kâvyâ. II. 282) though not found in the Veṇi-Saṃhâra, raises a presumption of some earlier drama in which Bhîma and Duḥśâsana are brought face to face. Such marked coincidences quite naturally lead to the surmise that wherever Daṇḍin could not actually quote the words, he resorted to the next best expedient of paraphrasing such verses as suited his purpose. Svapneśvarâchârya, the learned commentator of the Sâṇḍilya Sûtra has actually described the following couplet अद्य या मम गोविन्द जाता त्वयि गृहागते। कालेनैषा भवेत् प्रीतिस्तवैवागमनात्पुनः। ( II. 276 ) as a प्रतिरूपा or paraphrase of Vidura's welcome to Srîkṛishṇa in the Mahâbhârata. (See Udyogaparva, 91, 29-30). The wellknown Subhâshita सुखं जीवन्ति हरिणाः वनेष्वपरसेविनः (Kâvyâ. II. 341) is most probably a quotation, since Daṇḍin himself says in the next verse सेयमप्रस्तुतैवात्र मृगवृत्तिः प्रशस्यते। राजानुवर्तनक्लेशनिर्विण्णेन मनस्विना।(Kâvyâ. II. 342 ). The Subhâshita-Ratna-Bhâṇḍâgâra ascribes the verse एकवक्रो रथो यन्ताetc. (Kâvyà. II. 328) to a poet by name Argata about whom nothing. is known. If all the poetical literature which Daṇḍin had before him, were available to us, we might possibly have been able to trace many more verses which formed the basis of his observations, but the few that we have cited above are sufficient to show that he made no claim to originality, but as premised by him at the outset (I. 2) studied the poetical usages of earlier authors. We have laboured this point somewhat only to show that Daṇḍin in composing the Kâvyâdarśa drew more upon other writers than upon his own imagination. We do not deny that he must have possessed considerable poetical talent and must have been able to write very elegant verse, but what man of real literary culture, especially a literary critic, is not able to do this? But just as a few drops of rain do not make the rainy season, the occasional writing of a few verses cannot surely entitle one to the high distinction of a poet. The colophon at the end of the work rightly describes the author as आचार्यदण्डी an appellation which all subsequent writers have confirmed by tradition to distinguish him from his name-sake the poet.

**Age of the Kâvyâdarśa .**

 54. The question of the non-identity of the authorship of the Daśakumâracharita and the Kâvyâdarśa cannot be finally set at rest until the age of the latter is even approximately settled. We propose, therefore, to see if the contents of the Kâvyâdarśa itself can furnish a clue in this direction.  
The Kâvyâdarśa contains in the following verse a distinct reference to the Setubandha :—

**महाराष्ट्राश्रयां भाषां प्रकृष्टं प्राकृतं विदुः।  
सागरः सूक्तिरत्नानां सेतुबन्धादि यन्मयम्॥ ( I. 34 ).**

 Pravarasena, the author of the Setubandha, is placed by all authorities, not later than the fifth century A. D. Assuming this as the *terminus ad quem*, let us see how far further we can push our enquiry. The reminiscence from Bâṇa quoted by Peterson appears to us to be very convincing, but even if we ignore it, there are indications here and there which by cumulation furnish pretty sure ground for pursuing our enquiry. In giving an illustration of the *Saṅkhyâta* variety of *Prahelikâ*, the author has given us the following verse:—

**नासिक्यमध्या परितश्चातुर्वर्ण्यविभूषिता।  
अस्ति काचित्पुरी यस्यामष्टर्णाह्वया नृपाः॥( III. 114 ).**

 The commentator identifies the town as काञ्ची, which is made up of four alphabets having a nasal in the centre and adds in reference to the kings of that town काञ्चीनगर्यांपल्लवा नाम क्षितिपतयः सन्तीति विवक्षितार्थस्य चतुरष्टवर्णशब्दाभ्यां सङ्ख्यावाचिभ्यां व्यामोहकरत्वात्सङ्ख्यातत्वम्। If the com mentator is right in this identification, we have a clear hint that the author lived in the times of the Pallavas who ruled over Kâñchî, till about the middle of the eighth century A. D. If we piece this reference to another to a king by name Râjavarman\* (II. 279) we obtain a clue to fixing,

—————————————————————————————————————————

 \* Prof. Raṅgâchârya reads रातवर्मन् though he has also givenराजवर्मन्the reading of most other Mss. Since no king of the Pallava dynasty is known to have borne that name, we have adopted the readingराजवर्मन् as the correct one.

however approximately, the age of the Kâvyâdarśa. This Râjavarman is possibly the Râjasiṃha who has been identified by Dr. Fleet with Narasiṃhavarmâ II ( *vide* p. 330 of Fleet's ‘Dynasties of the Kanarese kings'). This King was a devout Śaiva and is known to have built many temples in honour of Śiva and the praise which Daṇḍin has put into the mouth of that king in verse II. 278, comes very appropriately from the lips of such a devoted worshipper.

 There is a widely believed tradition that the Kâvyâdarśa was written by Daṇḍin to serve as a text book for his royal pupil. The word पश्य in the 2nd Pers. Sing. occurring in I. 5 and II. 172, lends support to the tradition of the author's having compiled the work for a single pupil, but the additional circumstance that the pupil's attention is pointedly drawn to the "reflection in the mirror of literature of the glory of former kings" ( आदिराजयशेविम्बमादर्शं प्राप्य वाङ्मयम्। तेषामसन्निधानेऽपि न स्वयं पश्य नश्यति I. 5 ) seems clearly to confirm the tradition of a royal pupil. Now, Mahendravarman, the son and successor of Narasiṃhavarman II, already referred to, is known as the author of a Sanskrit burlesque called मत्तविलासप्रहसनम् and it is quite possible that this Mahendravarman was the princely pupil for whom Daṇḍin wrote his work. Narasiṃhavarman II was the son and successor of Parameśvaravarman I who is placed between A. D. 655 and 680. Consequently Narasiṃhavarma must have ruled over Kâñchî about the very end of the seventh century and if all that we have urged above is accepted, Daṇḍin would seem to have flourished in the latter half of the seventh century.

 We proceed now to adduce tentatively a piece of collateral evidence which points the same way. We confess that it is not quite convincing, but if future research supplies the links which at this date are missing, the hint we are offering with some misgiving might perhaps be the most conclusive evidence in regard to the age of the author of the Kâvyâdarśa. This evidence is suggested by the last quarter of the first verse of the Kâvyâdarśa, which describes Sarasvatî, the Goddess of Learning, as "all white." (सर्वशुक्लासरस्वती). Now a Karnâṭaka poetess, named variously as Vidyâ, Vidyakâ, Vijjâ or Vijjakâ (See Thomas' Kavindra.' p. 106) seems to have assumed, the so- briquet of Sarasvatî and the claim seems to have been admitted by such an authority as Râjaśekhara, who, according to the Sûkti-muktâvali, the Subhàshita-Hârâvali and the Śâraṅgadharapaddhati extolled this poetess as सरस्वतीवकार्णाटी विजयाङ्का जयत्यसौ। या वैदर्भगिरां वासः कालिदासादनन्तरम् ।Paṇdit Durgâprasâda and Parab in their Sanskrit preface to the Karpûramañjari also venture the guess that the verse:—

 एकोभून्नलिनात्ततश्च पुलिनाद्वल्मीकतश्चापरस्ते सर्वे कवयो भवन्ति गुरवस्तेभ्यो नमस्कुर्महे। अर्वाञ्चो यदि गद्यपद्यरचनैश्चेतश्चमत्कुर्वते **तेषां मूर्ध्नि ददामि वामचरणं कर्णाटराजप्रिया॥**

 The last line is important, since it shows the egotism which led विज्जका to assume the name of Sarasvatî. If Durgâpraśada's guess is right, we can very well account for the following verse as coming according to the Śâraṅgadharapaddhati and the Subhâshita-Hârâvali, from the lips of Vijjakâ herself:

**नीलोत्पलदलश्यामां विज्जकां मामजानता।  
वृथैव दण्डिना प्रोक्तं सर्वशुक्ला सरस्वती॥**

 The pleasant banter implied in the couplet has a point\* only when there was a chance of their meeting each other during their life-time. This means that at some time or other they were contemporaries. The high praise which Râjaśekhara, no mean judge of poetical merit, has bestowed upon the poetess inclines us to hold that the verse was uttered by

—————————————————————————————————————————

 \* A friend has brought to my notice the reading विजयाङ्काम् for विज्जकां माम्, which would imply that the gibe was uttered not by the poetess herself, but by some other person. Even if this reading is admitted, it is necessary to concede that there was a possibility of Daṇḍin's personal knowledge of the poetess' complexion having preceded in time his description of Sarasvatî as "all white." Daṇḍin could surely not have dreamed of a poetess being born after him, who would claim to be an incarnation of the Goddess of Learning. A note to p. 53 of the Kâvya-Mîmâṃsâ of Râjaśekhara (See p. 10 of the Notes) ascribes the following reading of the verse to Râjaśekhara himself,

**नीलोत्पलदलश्यामां विज्जकां तामजानता।  
वृथैव दण्डिनाप्युक्तं सर्वशुक्ला सरस्वती॥**

But this ascription seems to be erroneous, since in the whole of the Kâvya-Mîmâṃsâ, there is not a single reference to the Kâvyâdarśa. In Dr. Bhandarkar's Report for the years 1887-1890-91 the verse is given as anonymous (vide p. xii). According to Mr. Thomas also, the verse is given as anonymous in the Sûkti-ratnâvali.

Vijjakâ herself and if we could ascertain her age, we should be in a position to settle, however approximately, the date of the Kâvyâdarśa.

 We have seen that Râjaśekhara has described the poetess as a कार्णाटी and she calls herself the beloved wife of a king of Karnâṭaka. Who was this king of Karnâṭaka is the next question to decide. As far as research has gone hitherto, only one Vijayâ has been traced as a queen of Karnâṭaka. She is mentioned as Vijayâ-Bhaṭṭârikâ in the Nerur and Kochre grants (vide ‘Ind. Ant.,' Vol. VII., p. 163, and Vol. VIII., p. 44). She was the queen of Chandrâditya, eldest son of Pulakeshi II., the conqueror of Harsha. The date of the grants is Śake 581, that is, A. D. 659. We own to some misgiving in accepting without great reserve this queen as the poetess, since the epithet कलिकालप्रतिपक्षभूता applied to her in the grants cannot be taken to imply that she was a poetess. This is undoubtedly a serious flaw, but her date is so near that of the Pallava King Râjavarmâ, and if Durgâprasâda's conjecture is right, her description of herself as a queen and the proud distinction which Râjaśekhara conferred upon her as the abode after Kâlidâsa of utterances in the Vaidarbhîstyle, and also as Sarasvatî, tempt us to identify this Vijayâ as the one who indulged in that light pleasantry in reference to Daṇḍin's description of Sarasvatî. We offer the hint for what it is worth in the hope that future research might possibly supply the links wanting in this line of enquiry. Is it possible that Viśâkhadatta, the author of the Mudrârâkshasa, who lived according to Telang “in the early part of the eighth century” had this Vijayâ in his mind in writing the third line of the Nândî to that drama?

 It may be seen that all the three lines of investigation, viz. (1) the reminiscences from former poets,. (2) the reference to Kâñchîand the Pallava King Râjavarmâ, and (3) the reference by Vijayâ, converge and point towards the close of the seventh or the beginning of the eighth century as the age of Daṇḍin, the author of the Kâvyâdarśa.

 55. Rao Saheb T. A. Gopinatha Rao has suggested another piece of evidence in support of the same conclusion and we proceed to give it in his own words. "I might call your attention to the mention of Daṇḍin as a contemporary of the Jain teacher Śrîvardhadeva whose name preceded that of Akalaṅka only by one generation in an inscription dated the 12th century A. D. (‘Ep. Ind.,' Vol. III., p. 200).. Akalaṅka, again, was a contemporary of Sâhasatuṅga; and I have found this latter title held by the Râshṭrakûṭa Dantidurga (Dantivarma II.) of about the middle of the eighth century, in a Telugu recórd from the Cuddapah District. Consequently it looks as if Daṇḍin the great rhetorician—if at all he is identical with the Daṇḍin mentioned in the Jain inscription above referred to—must have lived roughly in the beginning of the eighth or in the last quarter of the seventh century."

 56. A study of the Kâvyâdarśa seems to show that the author was a Southerner. In illustrating. his canon on देशविरोध for contradiction in location, he refers to Kaliṇgas, Cholas and the banks of the Kauveri. He has also a reference to the Jainas (vide III. 46) which seems to show that that sect had just begun to lose ground. His particular reference to Kâñchî is well-known.

 57. Let us now proceed to the consideration of a subject which also arises out of the Kâvyâdarśa. Are the verses composed by Daṇḍin in illustrating his literary canons sufficient to entitle him to be recognised not only as a great poet, but as the rival of Kâlidâsa? Mr. Thomas has verified only 16 verses cited in the Śâraṅgadharapaddhati, and some more can be traced in the Subhâshitaratnabhâṇḍagâra. but the five citations from the Śriṅgâratilaka, the Sadukti-Karṇâmṛita, Subhâshitamuktâvali and the Padyaveṇî, which Mr. Thomas has verified, are suffi-cient to justify an inference that there must have been a poet by name Daṇḍin. Tradition abounds with stories of the poetical contests between Daṇḍin and Kâlidâsa, and the verse वनिताकरतामरसºverified by Mr..Thomas is supposed to be Daṇḍin's extempore rejoinder to Kâlidâsa's एकोपि त्रय इव भाति कन्दुकोयम्. This tradition of the contemporaneity of Daṇḍin and Kâlidâsa is supported by the following verse ascribed to Kâlidâsa in the Subhâshita-Hârâvali and in the Subhâshita Ratnakara—

**जाते जगति वाल्मीकौकविरित्यभिधाभवत्।  
कवी इति ततो व्यासे कवयस्त्वयि दण्डनि॥**

 When we consider that this volume of tradition has not only been handed down by generations, but has left clear traces in anthologies of a substratum of fact, we feel bound to concede that there was surely a poet by name Daṇḍin, whose works have been lost to us. It is possible that the three works referred to by Râjaśekhara must have been written by this Daṇḍin. An oft-quoted but still unverified verse picking out the peculiar excellence of the four poets who have written Mahâkâvyas gives the palm to Daṇḍin for felicity of expression.\* Are we to find this felicity in the verses of the Kâvyâdarśa? If prose works are meant, are not Bâṇa's works superior to the Daśakumâracharita? The three other poets named in the verse are Kâlidâsa, Bhâravi and Mâgha, who have left us long metrical compositions. Is it possible that a writer of prose fiction is bracketed along with these three shining luminaries in the firmament of Sanskrit verse? All these considerations incline us to the belief that there must have been a poet by name. Daṇḍin, the author of the Prabandhas.

**Daṇḍin of the Daśakumâracharita.**

 58. Who then was this Daṇḍin, the author of the Daśakumâracharita ? All research has failed till now to give us any clue to obtaining a satisfactory answer and fully 70 years after Prof. Wilson first edited the work, we have nothing better than a series of conjectures even about the name.

 Prof. Wilson conjectured that this author was “a Daṇḍin” “who amused his leisure with inventing

—————————————————————————————————————————

**\* उपमा कालिदासस्य भारवेरर्थगौरवम्।  
दण्डिनः पदलालित्यं माघे सन्ति त्रयो गुोणाः॥**

the stories in question, however inconsistent with his religious meditations” (p. 4, Intro.). Some well-known Pandits in Southern India who have kindly favoured us with their views concur in this conjecture and Pandit Krishṇamâchariar advances another conjecture that the author had the sobriquet given him in a spirit of banter by his contemporaries. Pandit Chakravarti on the other hand considers him a Sannyâsîn whose cravings for the delights of sense outlived his assumption of the yellow garb. Others again think that he was an impostor who like Chatterton in English Literature attempted to pass off his own work under a revered name.

 All that we can glean from the Daśakumâracharita itself is that he was very probably a native of Southern India. In his references to Kaliṅga and Ândhra, his language and style are specially felicitous. The story of Gominî in the sixth Uchchhvâsa is so realistic in all details and gives such a minute description of economic house-keeping in Southern India that it is found unchanged even at this date. The reference to cock-fights already cited is another evidence of the poet having been a Southerner.

 59. To conclude, we have attempted to show by internal and external evidence that the author of the Daśakumâracharita could not be placed earlier than Râjaśekhara and consequently this Daṇḍin could not be in his mind when he wrote his verse on Daṇḍin.

 60. Many ingenious suggestions have been put forward as to the three works of Daṇḍin, on the assumption that the Daśakumâracharita was also written by him. Some have suggested a छन्दोविचिति but that is a very common name for a work on Prosody. For, we read even in Âpastamba—छन्दः कल्पो व्याकरणं निरुक्तं शिक्षा छन्दोविचितिरिति ( प्र. २, ख. ४, सू. ११ ) also छन्दोविचितिरिव मालिनीसनाथा(p. 135, Vâsavadattâ, Vâṇivilâsa Series), छन्दोविचितिकलाकामशास्त्रदण्डनीतिपूर्वा विद्या (Vâmana, Kâvyâlaṃkâra III. 3, and again in the same छन्दोविचितेर्वृत्तसंशवच्छेदःIII. 6 ). Even Varáhamihira has said विपुलामपि बुध्वा छन्दोविचितिम्. The commentator of Kâvyâdarśa says in his gloss छन्दोविचित्यामिति ... छन्दोविचित्यां पिङ्गलनागेन दर्शितः (Kâvyâdarśa, p. 10, Raṅgâchârya's edition).

 As the third work, others have suggested a कलापरिच्छेद by Daṇḍin. The commentator above referred to says, however, काव्यादर्शस्य कश्चिदन्योपि परिच्छेदोस्तीत्याहुः। तत्र कलाचतुः षष्टिर्द्रष्टव्या (p. 282, Kâvyâdarśa). A chapter on कलाdoes not seem to be improbable, since even Vâmana in the above Sûtra makes a reference to कला.  

 But all this search appears to be needless, since aswe have attempted to show it is all on the wrong track. It is to trace the three works of the Poet Daṇḍin that our researches must be directed.

 61. 'As to the verse cited in the Śravana Belgola Inscription referred to in Dr. Peterson's Preface, it is possible that it may have been written by the author of the Kâvyâdarśa, since Mr. T. A. Gopinatha Rao has expressed the opinion that Śrivardha-deva, the Jain poet to whom the panegyric refers, lived about the end of the seventh or the early part of the eighth century.

 62. Bhâsa was till recently nothing more than a mere name. Let us hope that some fortunate explorer like Gaṇapati Śâstri will at no distant date light upon the lost works of Daṇḍin and satisfy the curiosity of the Sanskrit-loving world as regards the three works of Daṇḍin, "well-known in all three worlds."

 The late Dr. Peterson has noticed in his edition of the Subhâshitâvali no less than 350 poets. Mr. Thomas has given references in the Introduction to the Kavîndra-Vacana-samuccaya to 109 poets, besides only naming 66 more. Râjaśekhara's memorial verses which record the names of different poets mention only 37 poets, of whom the works of only 6, *viz*. कालिदास, कुमारदास, बाण, भारवि, माघ and भास have seen the light of day. The works of the rest are either entirely lost or lie buried in obscurity. However much the lover of Sanskrit poetry may regret the inaccessibility of such a treasure, he must console himself with the hope that time will restore these precious gems. It is no wonder that Daṇḍin shares the fate of so many of his compeers.

**Conclusion**. 

 63. All that we have attempted to do in this rather lengthy introduction is to bring together what material we could find to dissociate the Daśakumâracharita from the name of Âcharya Daṇḍin, the author of the Kâvyâdarśa. Much, however, remains to be done to clear the mist that hangs about the name of Daṇḍin. Was there a poet of the name of Daṇḍin, distinct from Âchârya Daṇḍin, the author of the Kâvyâdarśa? If there was one, was he a contemporary of Kâlidâsa as the 'S. Hârâvalî and the S. Ratnâkara seem to suggest in the verse जाते जगति वाल्मीकौ, etc. (see para 57)? Or was the author of the Kâvyâdarśa also the poet referred to by Râjaśekhara in his famous couplet ? If he was identical, what are the three Prabandhas "well-known in the three worlds"? Gangâ-devî, the famous poetess queen of Vijâyanagar who wrote the Madhurâ-Vijayam in celebration of her husband's conquest, seems to take the author of the Kâvyâdarśa as the poetDaṇḍin, since in the course of her panegyric on earlier poets, she expressly prefixes the epithettoआचार्य Daṇḍin's name in the following verse :—आचार्य दण्डिनो वाचामाचान्तामृतसंपदाम्। etc. ( I. 00 ). We cannot see our way to reconcile this ascription with the absence of all reference to the Kâvyâdarśa in the Kâvya-Mîmâṃsâ, also ascribed to Râjaśekhara. The last work is professedly a work on Poetics and it is a matter of surprise that there is absolutely no mention of the Kâvyâdarśa at least in the recently published part of that work. Or was this Râjaśekhara quite a different person from the one who wrote the memorial verses on poets? If in the course of future research the poet Daṇḍin is found to be distinct from Âcharya Daṇḍin of the Kâvyâdarśa as also from his name-sake, the author of the Dasakumâracharita, we shall have to concede that there were three Daṇḍins, as Râjaśekhara himself is credited with the supposition of three Kâlidâsas ( श्रृङ्गारे ललितोङ्गारे कालिदासत्रयी किमु( S. Hârâvalî). These are some of the questions that must await further research.

( Dec. Col. Mss. *No. 32.*  
                1873-74.)

 **P. 1. L. 3.** कूपदण्डः(कूपो गुणवृक्षः ) hence कूपदण्डः"A mast;" अक्षदण्डः “a pole-staff;” कालदण्डः“a death-dealing club." "The author apparently alludes to the name of the original writer, Daṇḍin, by including in his initiatory benediction the word Daṇḍa 'a stick or staff ' in a variety of applications."(Wilson).The metre of the verse is Sragdharâ. It is quoted in the Second Parichchheda of the Sarasvatî-Kaṇtḥâbharaṇa, P. 1. 14. (Borooah). \[Bühler\].

 Wilson's remark can hold good if the Pûrvapîthikâ can be proved to be also the work of Daṇḍi, but tradition is all the other way. Prof. Kale sees in the word त्रैविक्रम the result of the exploits of three men "a reference to the literary labours of three workmen."

 As pointed out by Bühler, the verse is quoted in the Sarasvatî-Kaṇthabharaṇa as an instance of समस्तानेकगुण अनुप्रास, but it is note-worthy that the author's name is not cited. It is also quoted along with five other benedictory verses at the beginning of a work called the Subhâshita Prabandha of Bhoja (P. 1. Dec. Col. Collection No. 248-Vis) and is cited under Ashis in the Sârngadharapaddhati. It may be noted that it is not cited by Mr. Thomas under Dandin.

 **P. 1. L. 6.** निकषायमाणा Nominal pres. pt. "serving as a test or standard (to all cities)." (Wilson). Mark the author's fondness for alliteration. °माणा...गण्यपण्य &c.मणिगणा–शश्वद्–माहात्म्या " whose greatness equal to that of the ocean (which is also a mine of jewels) was manifested by the quantities of countless jewels and other articles that were constantly offered for sale and were countless"\[Bühler\].

 **P. 1. L. 8.** पुष्पपुरी ‘Patna.' \[Bühler\]. As this city is described as the capital of Magadha and is also referred to asपुष्पपुरin L. 4. P. 9. and as Kusumapura in L. 14. P. 81. it seems to be the same as the Kusumapura of the Mudrârâkshasa. (Vide P. 22, Telang's Edition). According to Hiuen-Thsang the old capital of Kânyakubja was called Kusumapura. "Are we to see in this statement a hint that in former times (under the Maukharis) Pâtaliputra and Kânyakubja were under one Government? Or was Kusumapura an older name for Kanauj? Kusumapura appears to have been the name of the royal precinct at Pâtaliputra (Beal, Buddhist Records Vol. II. P. 83. note 4) and it is possible that if the Guptas established a more central capital for their dominions the new place and royal precinct should preserve the name of the old, and this name (as in the case of the capital of Magadha) be used to denote the town itself." (Mark Collin's Geographical Data of the Raghuvaṃsa and Daśakumâracharita, P. 25).

 वीर-भट-दण्डः '' The enemy's army is the ocean, the heroic warriors are its waves, the horses and elephants, the sharks or alligators in it and the King's arm the churning-stick." (Bühler ). Note the author's fondness for alliteration in bringing together भट and पटल, उत्तरङ्ग and तुरङ्ग, पुराङ्गण and पुरन्दर and all the following words having a नor , because of the jingle they produce.

** P. 1. L. 10.** पुरन्दरेत्यादि ‘ the young dancing women are the Apsarâs' \[Bühler\].

 **P. 1. L. 11.** शरदित्यादि. Mark the tautology involved in the use of the twelve nouns in this long compound. All those words from शरदिन्दुto काश connote the same idea of 'whiteness' and the whole compound looks like a string of railway trucks! It is worthy of note that Daṇḍin, the author of the Kâvyadarśa condemns this sort of tautology. (Vide Kâvyadarśa, IV. 2. Raṇgâchârya's Ed.)

 "शरदित्यादि down to काश is a Dvandva compound, then a Karmadhâraya and finally a Bahuvrihi. The whole qualifies कीर्त्या ‘fame' which is represented as 'brilliantly white i. e., resplendent and pure.' The अट्टहास of Śiva is said to be "white" because the God shows his white teeth, when he laughs. The translation of गिरिशाट्टहास should be "the glitter of Śiva's teeth, when he laughs loudly" \[Bühler\].

 **P. 1. L. 13.** स्वर्लोकैत्यादि—‘who had the happiness to enjoy as his wife the earth, whose girdle is the ocean, which contains jewels as large and brilliant as Mount Meru.'(Bühler).

 **P. 1. L. 14.** अनवरतेत्यादि who maintained by his rewards for the constant performance of sacrifices Brahmaṇas who were Śishtas (Vide Manu XII,109, and Âpa-stamba I. 7,208.)' Visishta' 'excellent and resplendent through carrying a load of sacred learning' i.e., brahmavarchasinah.\[Bühler\].

 **P. 1. L. 15.** विरचितारातिसंतापेन प्रतापेन सतततुलितवियन्मध्यहंसः. Note the use of the periphrasis वियन्मध्यहंसः for the sun, simply for the sake of alliteration with राजहंसः. "The swan

of the sky is the sun—a simile which occurs already in the Rig-Veda, e. g., I. 163, 9" \[Bühler\].

 **P. 1. L. 16.** धनदर्प&c. This is a compound which is inelegant according to a canon of Daṇḍi, the author of the Kâvyâdarśa. (Vide Kâvyâdarśa I. 72.)

 **P. 2. L. 1.** The second word वसुमती must be construed with रमणी, since लीलावती-कुलशेखरमणि does not bear a double meaning, so as to be an attributive to वसुमती ‘the earth.'

** P. 2. L. 3.** भस्मीकृतचेतने.The vital principle which is an abstract notion can never be reduced to ashes. We must therefore take चेतन here in the sense of body—an instance of looseness in the selection of words which characterises the whole of the Púrvapîthikâ. The word, however, seems to have been used for the jingle it makes with केतने in the following expression. "Construe भयेन with समभूवन् in line 12"\[Bühler\]. तस्य refers to मकरकेतन,the idea being that when the body of the God of Love was burnt by the fire emanating from the forehead of Śiva, all the armoury of Cupid with which he conquers the world found a resting place in the limbs of Vasumatî who being a woman was unassailable. If the reading तस्याःis preferred, it must be taken to refer to वसुमती.

 **P. 2. L. 9.** जैत्ररथ "the victorious car of Kâma." See below P. 25. L. 25. and P. 74. L. 6. (where the sameidea occurs). अतिघनं जघनंis really compared to the wheels of the chariot and not to the chariot itself. \[Bühler\].

 **P. 2. L. 10.** रम्भे “two plantain-stems.” जयस्तम्भ "a pillar of victory” or a tṛiumphal column." The pillars of victory which are found in the Presidency, e. g., at Kapadvanja and Siddhapur and which belong to the times of the Chalukya dynasty of Anhilpur Pâtan, consist of two carved columns united by a Torana, See also Forbes' Ras Mâlâ I. P. 253. seqq. \[Bühler\].

  **P. 2. L. 12.** The adjective सानन्तभोगलालिता can be construed with both वसुमती, the Earth, in which case अनन्तभोग means the body of Śesha, the fabled serpent, which supports the Earth, and also with वसुमती in which case अनन्तभोग means "countless enjoyments."

 **P. 2. L. 14.** परमविधेयाः "charged with great offices" परमं विधेयं कार्यं येषां तेपरमविधेयाः\[Wilson\]; better "most obedient,” see the Pet. Dict. under विधेय—धीरेत्यादि "who despised on account of their firm understanding business which would have given trouble to Brihaspati." \[Bühler\].

 **P. 2. L. 21.** पुरंदरपुरातिथिषु पितृषु “their fathers being dead or having been received as guests in the City of Indra. \[Wilson\];" at present the usual euphemism for "he died" is among Śaivas कैलासं गतः”\[Bühler\].The author, however, seems to intend स्वर्ग which is more commonly supposed to be the abode of the dead.

 **P. 2. L. 22.** नानाविधेत्यादि, with जन्य (battle) ends the first Bahuvrihi, which qualifies राजन्य. महदायुध is possibly not a grammatical blunder but intended to be a puzzle. It ought to be explained as महदानि आयुधानि “weapons giving greatness or glory" महं ददातीति महदः \[Bühler\]. But

this word महत् is found again on P. 6. L. 19. in composition with अभिख्या. The latter word ordinarily means “fame” andमहत् must therefore be taken in its ordinary sense of "great." The same word also occurs at P. 16. L. 10. in composition, as महदाशापूर्णमानसः and some have explained it as महद + आशा, giving to the word मह the meaning of "liberation." But this unusual meaning of मह appears to be inconsistent with the immediately preceding epithet कार्पण्याविवर्णवदनः। In the preceding line the Brahmin is also described as दीनानन, बहुतनयसमेत, and स्थाविर; and सोमदत्त is also described as उदीतदय. Consequently, it is better to take the word महत् as it is, and consider this use of महत्instead ofमहा° as a lapse on the part of the author.

** P. 2. L. 23.** प्रत्यग्रेत्यादि “who was insatiable in new battles." \[Bühler\].

 **P. 2. L 25.** हठिकाकर्णनेत्यादि The meaning seems to be, "who were mortally afraid on account of the great noise of the army." Wilson gives a marginal note from one of his Mss. हठिकाकर्णनं शुश्रूषामन्तरा यदाकर्णनं सा (sic) हठिकाकर्णनं महान्नादसमुदायसंघातः(Bühler). Godbole's own Sanskrit glossary in the Nirṇayasâgara edition explains the expression हठिकाकर्णनाद् asमहतो ध्वनेर्बलादाकर्णनाच्छ्रवणात्। हटिका is a very obscure word, and according to the commentators, it seems to be connected with हठ, which means force or violence, the expression हठिकाकर्णन meaning "the involuntary hearing of sound." शुश्रुषा literally means the 'desire to hear' and शुश्रुषामन्तरा आकर्णनं would, therefore, mean the hearing of sounds without any desire or effort to hear.

 **P. 2. L. 26.** निजेत्यादि“(with an army) which was hurting the heads of the snake King already tired by carrying &c. "^(०)वल is derived from the root बल्हिंसायाम् for which the Pet. Dict. gives no examples, by the affix अच् Siddh II 320 (Pan. III. 1. 140). \[Bühler\]. The word according to Native Grammarians is derived under two Sutras दन्तशिखात्संज्ञायाम् (Pan. V. 2. 113) and वले (Pan. VI. 3. 118) कृषीवल is formed by the same suffix.निजभरेत्यादि।Godbole explains the whole compound as under :— निजभरेण स्वभारेण नमन्त्यधोगच्छन्ती या मेदिनी पृथ्वी तस्या भरेण भारेणायस्तं पीडितं भुजंगानां राजा शेषस्तस्य मस्तकबलं येन।

  **P. 3. L. 2.** विग्रहः सविग्रह इव a “like war incarnate." \[Bühler\].

**P. 3. L. 4.** नव्यवल्लभेत्यादि. “The Apsarâs come to the battlefields in order to choose husbands among the fallen warriors and to lead them to Indra's heaven. The cloud of dust which hangs over the battlefield is therefore compared to a nuptial Maṇdapa, a square enclosure, the sides of which are formed by gay coloured curtains and which is erected in front of the bride's dwelling," \[Bühler\].

 **P. 3. L. 5.** दिविषदध्वनि must be construed with धिक्कृतेत्यादि ''deafening the universe with the roll of the drums that surpassed all other sounds in the air.”\[Bühler\].

 **P. 3. L. 6.** शस्त्राशस्त्रि हस्ताहस्ति.These compounds are formed in accordance with the Sutras तत्र तेनेदमिति सरूपे(II.2.27) and इच्कर्तव्यतिहारे(V. 4. 127).Compare Kielhorn's Sanskrit Grammar S. 558.

 **P. 3. L. 14**. सीमन्तोत्सवम् A purificatory and sacrificial ceremony observed by women in the fourth, sixth or eighth month of pregnancy, an essential part of the rite being a partition of the hair.

 **P. 3. L. 16.** देवेन विरच्यार्चनार्हो Our Southern Manuscript reads देवेन विरञ्च्यर्चने नियुक्तः which too does not give a good meaning. If विरच्य is a misreading for विरिञ्च्य, it may mean "one who is fit to be worshipped like the God Brahmâ." As it is, देवेन विरच्यार्चनार्हः can only mean "one who is fit to be worshipped by the King" देवेन विरच्या यार्चना तामर्हतीति.

 **P. 3. L. 18**. सम्यग्ज्ञातेत्यादि The Fakir's or Bawa's dress is now, as it was in olden times, a favourite disguise. Regarding the custom to send spies, see Kâmandaka Nîtisâra **XIII, 26** \[Bühler\]. तपस्विलिङ्गिनो धूर्ताः. For यति See Kirâta I. 1.

 **P. 4. L. 1.** कालीविलासिनमनश्वरं महेश्वरं The epithet कालीविलासिनं and अनश्वरare added merely for the sake of alliteration without much propriety.

 **P. 4. L. 5.** देवसहायेन. Parab and Kale as well as our Southern Ms. have देवसहायेन which is a better reading than दैवसहायेन, since the King of Mâlava had obtained a boon from Śiva. Note the solecism in the use of the word सहाय for साहाय्य.

 **L. 5.** असांप्रतम्=Inexpedient.

 **P. 4. L. 11.** मूलबल Kâmandaka enumerates six divisione of the army, Viz., मौल, भृत, श्रेणि, सुहृद्, द्विषत् and आटविकfor. Of these मौल as distinguished from भृत (mercenary) seems to correspond to the modern "Militia." Kâmandaka. **XIX. 3.**

 **P. 4. L. 24.** कल्याणि &c., Some word to say that the Ministers addressed the Queen would make the sentence more intelligible. As it is, we must take the whole clause from कल्याणि in **L. 24. P. 4.** to अनुनीयमानया in **L. 1. P. 5.** as the ministers' expostulation.

 **P. 5. L. 25.** हरिश्चन्द्र is named as the representative of the Solar race \[Bühler\]. He is considered to be the 28th of that dynasty and was celebrated for his piety and liberality and was on those accounts elevated along with his subjects to heaven.

  रामचन्दर also a King of the Solar dynasty, immortalized by the genius of Vâlmîki in the famous epic, the Râmâyaṇa.

L. 10.** holds good only on the supposition that the author of the Pûrvapîthikâ could write correct Sanskrit. Those who are of the contrary opinion, can point to the very bad forms आवोचि **P. 6. L. 13,** शासन् **P. 3. L. 10,** अदंशि **P. 10. L. 25.** which all Mss. offer. I for my part, however consider all of these blunders to be due to clerical mistakes” \[Bühler\]. See, however, our note **P. 2. L. 22.**  
  **P. 6. L. 21.** रसेन must be construed with अवाचि. \[Bühler\]. This word is omitted in our Southern Ms.  
  **P. 7. L. 1.** कीर्तिव्यापृतसुधर्माणि whose fame occupied the assembly of the gods. Prof. Taranath's correction व्याप्त for व्यापृत deserves consideration' \[Bühler\].  
 **P. 7. L. 5.** निजबले सति विधेये 'His obedient army not being on the spot' \[Bühler\]. This explanation however, does not seem to be correct, since in the very next line we have हतावशेषेण सैन्येन i. e., “ with the remnant of his army." Parab and Kale adopt the reading विदेहे and explain the word to mean “killed" which

too is inconsistent with हतावशेष in the next line. Instead of understanding an avagraha before सति, as Dr. Bühler does, will it not be better to take the expression निजवले सति विधेये as having an oppositional force and explain it, as “(though) his army was obedient or under control?”

 **P. 7. L. 6**.कारुण्येन पुण्येन विसृष्टः “having in consequence of his merit, been set free out of compassion." \[Bühler\]. Strict grammatical accuracy requires the insertion of च after पुण्येन. Cf. मैथिलस्तु मालवेन्द्रप्रयत्नप्राणितः in the story of उपहारवर्मन् **P. 66. L. 11.**

 **P. 7. L. 7.** The descendants of the Śavaras are probably the Suars (?) of modern India. Sanskṛit poets are not particular about the names of the aboriginal tribes. Below **P. 7. L. 22.** and **25,** the same people are called Kirâtas and **P. 8. L. 14.** again Śavaras, while **P. 66. L. 18.** the robbers who captured Apahâravarman are named Bhillas \[Bühler\]. Note also that the people who robbed the King of Mithilâ in the forest are called लुब्धक in that passage.

 **P. 7. L. 8.** महानिरोधः hemmed in on all sides. मूलबलाभिरक्षितावरोधः. The members of the harem being saved by the feudal army or militia. मूलबल formed one of the six branches of a King's army. Vide Note, ante **P. 4. L. 11.** Also Kâmandaka. **XIX. 3.**  
 **P. 7. L. 11.** Our Southern Ms. reads उदग्रग्रावणि and so also do Parab and Kale. We have adopted this reading in preference to the old उदग्रपाणिः, because ^(०)ग्रावणि gives better sense and accounts for her stumbling.

 **P. 7. L. 12.** मदीयदुहितेत्यादि. For this part of the story compare below the Upahâravarmacharita, **Page 66. L. 15-20.** क्रोडमभ्यलीयतisgrammatically a doubtful construction. अभ्यलीयत is according to Wilson ‘3rd Pers. Sing. 1st Pret. Atmanepada from ली verb of the 4th Conjugation,' but ली of that conjugation is intransitive and cannot take an object, and therefore the word क्रोड must be in the locative. Compare for the story **P. 66. L. 15-20.** where the same account is given in slightly different words. \[Bühler\].

 **P. 7. L. 24.** दंदशयित्वाऽee Kielhorn **S. Gr. S 355 b**. अनेकचरणैः पलायमानम्‘while he flies on all fours' \[Bühler\]. Parab takes अनेकचरणैः with कुक्कुरबालकैः and this is more plausible, since it is very doubtful, if a little child after such perilous adventures could have either the strength or presence of mind to run away on all fours.”

  **P. 8. L. 10.** पक्कणः शबरालयःA. K. \[Bühler\].

 **P. 8. L. 15.** आत्मपल्लीसमीपे ="पल्ल्यते पक्किः गृहालिः, कुटीग्रामकयोः पल्लिरिति तु शाश्वतः " क्षीरस्वामी.

 **P. 8. L. 23.** कालयवन By this term probably Zanzibar on the coast of Arabia is meant. (Bühler). This passage is specially referred to in Mookerji's "Indian Shipping" **(P. 66),** but there is no attempt made at identifying this island.

 It is interesting to note that in the Pûrvapîtḥikâ by Bhatta Nârâyaṇa, (Vide Appendix) the expression is simply यवनद्वीपम् ; so also instead of रामतीर्थे स्नात्वा  
प्रत्यागच्छता मया, we have कस्यांचिद्वेलायां वारिधिवेलायां भ्रमता मया. Whether the name of the island was given as कालयवन

and the name रामतीर्थ **(P. 8. L. 20.)** was introduced for poetic effect or to give the story a semblance of genuineness, it is hard to say. One thing is certain, namely, that रत्नोद्भव was ship-wrecked and that his infant son, hardly a few days old, was saved by Vâmadeva's disciple and brought with the mother all the way from the sea-shore to the fastnesses of theVindhya Mountains.

 To make the story credible, it is necessary to locate कालयवन as near the Vindhyas as possible, and it must also have adjacent to it some holy place called after Râma. Alexander is said by Ârian to have passed through a village called Râmbâkia which Cunningham has identified with "Râmbâgh in the Aghor valley, in which the principal sacred places are connected with the history of Râma, the great hero of the Râmâyaṇa." (Mc' Crindle's Invasion of India by Alexander P. 168). In the course of his voyage down the Western arm of the Indus from Pâtâla, Alexander reached an island where his fleet met with a mishap similar to that described in the text (Vide **P. 258** Me' Crindle). If the island कालयवन is ‘Killouta of Ârrian' (Mc' Crindle **P. 164),** the story has a semblance of plausibility.

 **P. 9. L. 1.** Note the alliteration in मनोहारी and व्यवहारी as well as ^(०)गुणालयो and ^(०)भूवलयो in the preceding line.

 **P. 9. L. 15.** महाग्रहेण महतावेशेत Paḍ.

 **P. 9. L. 18.** फलेतरतया because (he found that the child was) not a fruit.' (Bühler). See P. 20. lines 10 to 15 for the same story.

  **P. 10. L. 4.** यक्षकान्ता “a Yaksha woman" (Bühler). For the same story, See **P. 82. L. 15-20.**

  **P. 10. L. 10.** विधाय having named.

 **P. 10. L. 12.** समाराधितदेवकीर्तिम्“who had obtained or possessed a splendour equal to that of the gods \[Bühler\].

 The epithet might as well be taken with नरपतिं in which case कीर्तिं should be taken in its ordinary sense of fame. Wilson, Godbole and Kale insert another epithet निर्भर्त्सितमारमूर्ति between ^(०)देवकीर्ति and कुसुमसुकुमारम्. Our Southern Ms. does not give the epithet and we have preferred to follow Bühler.

 अवगमय्य literally "having brought near.”

  **P. 10. L. 20.** अग्रहार "a village or land given to a Brahmin for his maintenance" \[Bühler\].

  **P. 10. L. 25.** अदंशि. We have adopted this reading on the authority of our Southern Ms. Wilson, Parab and Kale also read अदंशि in place of the inaccurate form अदंशि of the old edition.

  **P. 11. L. 2.** विषमविषज्वालावलीढावयवा=her limbs being inflamed by the flame i. e. heat of the virulent poison.

  **P. 11. L. 12.** Regarding Chaula and Upanayana, see e. g., Âśvalâyana Grihya Sûtra I. 17, and 19 seqq \[Bühler\].

 **P. 11. L. 14.** आख्यानक 'Episodes' and आख्यायिका 'stories' like the Kâdambari. See also 'Daṇḍin' Kâvyâdarśa I. 23. seqq on the difficulty of distinguishing between a कथा and आख्यायिका. As a matter of fact Daṇḍi con-

siders कथा and आख्यायिका as one with only two names (तत्कथाख्यायिकेत्येका जातिः संज्ञाद्वयाङ्किता) Kâvyâd **I. 28.** In the text the word is चित्रकथा which the Paḍ. explains as रम्यकथा.

 **P. 11. L. 15.** कौटिल्यनीतिपटलis Châṇakya's Daṇdanîti. Compare also note to Pañchatantra II. and III. **P. 10. L. 7.** \[Bühler\].

 **P. 11. L. 18.** "The Institutes of thieving and gambling were very necessary for the heroes of the Daśakumâracharita, as their subsequent adventures show. The work on the art of house-breaking is ascribed to Karṇî-suta. See below note to **P. 48. L. 4.** and **P. 65. L. 6.** (Text)." \[Bühler\].

 **P. 11. L. 19.** तत्तदाचार्येभ्यः सम्यग्लब्ध्वा 'Having acquired proficiency (in all these branches of learning) from teachers or professors of the same.' This clearly implies an army of teachers, but what is more noteworthy is that there were regular instructors in the black arts such as magic, and such nefarious professions as house-breaking, thieving and gambling !

 The whole passage is noteworthy as the author's ideal of a prince's education. The vitiated taste, possibly the reflex of the degeneracy of the age in which the author lived, is forcibly and strikingly seen when this ideal of a prince's education is compared with that set forth in the Kâdambari. The latter has an addition of 25 more arts, some of which are remarkable and well worthy of being included in the range of studies befitting a prince. It may  
also be noted that the black arts of magic and the

sinister arts of thieving and gambling find no place in Baṇa's list of the accomplishments of a prince.

 It will be an interesting question to fix, however approximately, the age in which this degeneracy set in. In a work called Prabandhakośa composed by Râjasekhara, son of Abhaya, and pupil of Tilakasuri about the year, A. D. **1270** at Delhi, the following very interesting list of the subjects studied by Ama, son of Yaśodhara King of Kânyakubja, occurs at page 10 **(Vide Ms. No. 363, 1871-72 Dek. Col. Col.)**

 Some of these names are unintelligible, but खेचरीकला, अमरीकला, पातालसिद्धि, इन्द्रजालम् seem to mark the downward tendency of the age in which faith in occultism seems to have gained such a hold on the public mind as to have necessitated the inclusion of such arts in the scheme of a prince's education.

Evidently Bühler takes this as a Dvandva compound, but it might be taken as a Tatpurusha and तन्त्र understood in its ordinary sense of प्रधान ( principal ) or सिद्धान्त ( conclusion). Vide Amarakośa. **III. 3. 186.** तन्त्रं प्रधाने सिद्धान्त. Thus, the expression might mean "the conclusions arrived at in the different sciences or branches of learning."

 **P. 14. L. 2.** सिद्धसाध्याराध्यमानस्य " which is being worshipped by Siddhas and Sâdhyas" \[Bühler\]. The Siddhas are a class of gods-पिशाचो गुह्यकः सिद्धः Amarakośa **(I L. 11)** साध्याः are demigods or attendants upon gods, महाराजिकसाध्याश्च Amarakośa, **I. 1. 10.**

 **P. 14. L. 3.** विधेराननमिव as if it were an opening made by destiny or fate.

 **P. 14. L. 4.** ताम्रशासनम् properly ‘an edict of grant written on a copper-plate'. विधिमित्यादि perform the ceremonies (prescribed) on that, considering (that they will procure) victory over fate' \[Bühler\].

 **P. 14. L. 10.** साकल्येन every one of them.

 **P. 14. L. 17.** प्रत्यूहपरिहारिणि ‘whilst Râjavâhana wardedoff all impediments orinterruptions' (of the sacrifice by evil spirits etc.). \[Bühler\].

 **P. 14. L. 18.** पुण्यगेहम्abode of merit.

 **P. 14. L. 24**. असुरोत्तमनन्दिनी. Bhatta Nârâyaṇa takes this best of demons as Namuchi (Vide Appendix ).

 **P. 15. L. 7.** मां तत्सपत्नीं करोतु भवान् ‘make me the rival of that (kingdom) i. e., marry me' the kingdom being considered the first wife of the King \[Bühler\].

 **P. 15. L. 14.** विशाला“Ujjain.” उपशल्य “An open space near a village or town." \[Bühler\] Cf. प्राप्यावन्तीन्...अनुसर पुरी श्रीविशालां-विशालाम् Megh. **I. 30.**

 **P. 15. L. 16.** पल्लवितचोताः It is impossible to render exactly the very common simile of the Sanskṛit poets, by which the mind is compared to a tree and is said to throw out sprouts or shoots under the affection of joy. It may be translated by 'his mind being moved or affected by great joy' \[Bühler\].

 **P. 15. L. 19.** सरभस &c. From सरभस to विलासि must be taken as a compound qualifying हर्ष and the whole word as a Bahuvrîhî.

  **P. 15. L. 21.** राजा refers to राजवाहन though he was properly युवराज, without a kingdom.

 **P. 16. L. 1.** चिन्ताज्वरातिशयो.From the way in which सोमदत्त is introduced to the reader 'seated on a swing in the midst of damsels, there appears to be no visible sign of anxiety, unless it be on account of the disappearance of राजवाहन.

**THIRD UCHCHHVÂSA.**

 **P.16. L. 10.** महदाशेत्यादि. \* Whose mind was filled with hopes of (obtaining) liberation' \[Bühler\]. But it would be better to consider this a lapse on the part of the author. Vide note to **P. 2. L. 22.** where this expression is discussed at some length.

 **P. 16. L. 12.** "Something seems to have been left out in our Mss., as nothing has been said before regarding a royal camp" \[Bühler\]. May not the pronoun एतत्be taken as pointing with a finger towards a camp in the distance, since the context seems to suggest that Somadatta's very words are quoted ?

 **P. 16. L. 14.** लाटेश्वरः ‘the country of Lâta, the Larike of the ancients, corresponds nearly to Central Gujarat" (Bühler). According to Vincent A. Smith, it is Southern Gujarât (P 425, Early History of India Ed. 1914). It is mentioned as one of the 18 Maṇdalas or provinces in the Kumârapâla Prabandha Chintâmaṇi P. 243, Râjya-bhakta Printing Press, Bombay, A. D. 1888 अपरमालवपश्चिमेन लाटविषयः says Jayamangala.

 **P. 16. L. 16.** अवधूतदुहितृप्रार्थनस्य who scorned (Mattakâla's) suit for (the hand of) his (Vîraketu's) daughter. पाटली a town which seems to have been situated somewhere near विशाला.

 **P. 21. L. 1.** साधकत्व Quality as a Magician.

 **P. 21. L. 2.** विविधनिधिसूचक Indicating various (buried)treasures.

 **P. 21. L. 3.** वसुपूर्ण filled with treasure or coin.

 सिद्धाञ्जनेन ‘By Magic collyrium' enabling the eyes to see through opaque substances \[Wilson\].

 **P. 21. L. 4.** दीनार is derived from the Latin denarius and denotes a gold coin. According to Kâtyâyana and Bṛihaspati, as quoted by Nandapaṇdita on Vishṇu **IV. 9,** a Dinâra is equal in value to 42 Kârshika Paṇas. Dinâras were first coined in India by the Indo-Scythian Kings, Kanishka and his succes-sors \[Bühler\]. It may, however, be noted that the word दीनार is given by Amarasiṃha **III. 3. 14.** and is derived by Kshîrasvamin as दीनैरर्यते दीनारम्. It is formed according to Bhattoji Dîkshit under the Unâdi Sûtra दीङ्गो नुट् च **(427 U. S.).** Târânâtha in his Vâchaspatyam explains दीनार as विष्णुगुप्तोक्ते सप्तमांशाधिक हेमरतिकारूपरोपकैरष्टाविंशत्यापरिमिते though he does not give a more definite reference to this Vishṇugupta. It is clear, therefore, that the word was known to the author of the Unâdi Sûtrâs, Amarasiṃha and also to Vishṇugupta.

 It is also worthy of note that the author refers to the find of hidden treasure in the vicinity of the "sites of old towns," implying thereby that there were even in his times relics of an earlier age.

 **P. 21. L. 5.** गोणी 'a bag.' Here the double bags are meant which the Vanjâras and other traders use for conveying grain on their bullocks. \[Bühler\].

 **P. 21. L. 6.** अन्यद्रव्यमिषेणPretending that it was other people's property.  
 **P. 21. L. 7.** तदधिकारिणाwith their leader.  
 **P. 21. L. 10.** गूढवसति living in cognito.  
 **P. 21. L. 17.** लतान्तबाण = पुष्पधन्वा the flower god or the god of love. Cf. कुसुमसायक in the next line.  
 **P. 21. L. 18.** सायकायमान Nominal verb from सायक 'an arrow.'  
 **P. 22. L. 3.** रहस्य^(०) on account of the confidence produced by privacy.  
**P. 22. L. 7**.राजराजगिरि— ‘Himâlaya, the abode of Kubera.' (Bühler). राजराज is a name of Kubera and his residence is Kailâsa and not Himâlaya. Mark Collins refers to this mention as 'purely mythical' and one in which "the border line between real and mythical or fabulous geography is wholly disregarded" (P. 12. Geographical Data of the Daśak. ).  
**P. 22. L. 10.** भवतो लावण्यायतचित्ता Enamoured or charmed with your handsome appearance.  
 Note that भवेत् should properly have formed part of the compound लावण्यायतचित्ताम्.  
 **P. 22. L. 11.** दूरीकृत्य ‘not caring (if he commits) \[Bühler\].  
 **P. 22. L. 15.** अधिष्ठाय having possessed. तदाकारसंपदाशाशृङ्खलितहृदयो ' who chained or captivated by the hope of obtaining) that treasure of a form i. e., that beautiful damsel.'  
 **P. 22. L. 18.** सिद्धेन by a sage or seer.  
 **P. 23. L. 1.** एकान्तनिकेतने In a secluded apartment.  
 **P. 23. L. 4.** वंशसंपल्लावण्याढयाय “to me who am rich in personal charms and in nobility of birth or descent."

 **P. 23. L. 8.** युष्मन्मनोरथः note the use of युष्मत् when in the sentence immediately preceding पुष्पोद्भव is addressed as भवत्. In the succeeding the succeeding sentence he is again addressed as भवत्.  
  **P. 23. L. 20.** नगरव्याकुलां spread or known all over the town.  
 परीक्षन् can be defended by the Paribhasha अनुदात्तेत्वलक्षणमात्मनेपदमनित्यम् which though rejected by Nâgoji, is admitted by Bhattoji, Siddh. **II P. 112.** Compare also the Pet. Dict. under ईक्ष्+परि where examples of the Parasmaipada from the Mahâbhârata and the Purâṇas are given \[Bühler\].  
  **P. 24. L. 1.** कुचग्रहणे Parab also reads कुचग्रहणे which though suggestive of impropriety gives a more intelligible meaning. Wilson seems to have toned down the expression to सुमुख्यालिङ्गने, as he has done. wherever he found a trace of indecency.  
 **P. 24. L. 2.** प्राहरन् must be taken here in the sense of "Killed." नियुद्धम् ‘pugilistic encounter, personal encounter' \[Bühler\]. नियुद्धरभसविकलम्thrown into disorder in the heat of the wrestling or single combat.  
  **P. 24. L. 15.** अस्मै i. e., to Pushpodbhava.  
 **P. 24. L. 19.** महीसुरवर 'best of Brahmins' प्रकटयन् 'proclaiming' (that Râjavâhana the best of Brahmins was skilled in all arts). For a reason for such a feint, See **P. 27. L. 4-7.**  
 **P. 24. L. 20.**अञ्जनभोजनादिकम्. Parab and Kale read मज्जनभोजनादिकम् which is better, since अञ्जन would mean' anointing' and not bathing."

 **P. 25. L. 1.** मीनकेतन^(०) “ who was the leader of thearmy of the god having the fish on his banner i. e., the god of love."

 मलयगिरीत्यादि. “The snakes are said to feed on air and are called पवनाशन or पवनाशिन् (compare the Pet. Dict. Sub v. v.) Hence the South wind may be called the leavings of the snakes of the Malaya hills." \[Bühler\].  
 **P. 25. L. 2.** सूक्ष्मतरेण'Thinner,' because the serpents had had their feed before it blew blew away from the Malaya hills.  
 धूतहरि^(०) Parab and Kale read ya for धूत, which is a better reading, since it assigns a reason for the following epithet मन्दगतिना.  
 **P. 25. L. 3.** सहकारेत्यादि "Making the air noisy with the sweet sounds of the bees and of the koils whose throats were made tuneful by tasting the sap of the young sprouts of the Mango trees.” \[Bühler\].  
 **P. 25. L. 10.** चूतपोतक gada small or young Mango tree.  
 **P. 25. L. 11.** दन्धेत्यादि "consisting of various kinds such as sandal, flowers, rice mixed with saffron, minium and ambra " \[Bühler\].  
 **P. 25. L. 15.** रसालतरुषु Rasâla is a name of various trees, but may be understood here of the Mango which blossoms in spring \[Wilson.\]  
 **P. 25. L. 16.** विकसदिन्दीवर^(०) –इन्दीवर is blue lotus, कह्लार is white lotus, कैरव also a species of white lotus, राजीव is also a blue lotus.

 **P. 25. L. 20.** पुरुहूत literally “invoked by many,"a name of Indra. \[Bühler\].  
 **P. 25. L. 21.** Construe या with निर्मितेव रराज.  
 **P. 25. L. 25.** जैत्ररथ see above, note on **P. 2. L. 19.** \[Bühler\]:  
 Translate "and she shone as if created by Cupid who, who, fondly fondly longing after Rati, and desiring to make a statue of her, framed some female figure, produced its feet from the beauty of the autumnal lotus growing in his pleasure garden" &c. \[Bühler\]. **Cf. L. 2-10 P. 2** for a similar description.  
 **P. 26. L. 4**. प्रतिबिम्बीकृतबिम्बम् literally 'which made the Bimba fruit an imitation' or more freely, which surpassed the Bimba-fruit. \[Bühler\].  
 **P. 26. L. 14.**घुणाक्षरन्यायेन literally "according to the analogy of the wood-borer's writing, i. e., accidentally." When the insect called Ghuṇa, makes, holes in the wood, they occasionally resemble letters. But, of course, that happens accidentally. Compare Śiśupâlavadha III. 58. \[Bühler\].  
 **P. 26. L. 18.** रेचितभ्रू^(०)Wilson reads अंचित which is better. Does रेचित here mean curved as explained by Paḍ. at P. 53. L7?. कुरङ्गेत्यादि^(०‘)Whose beauty captivated herjust as the snare captures the deer \[Bühler\]. She was herself the deer and the beauty of Râjavâhana was the snare (आनाय) to her.  
 **P.26. L. 19.** भावरसानां^(०) भाव state of mind and रस sentiment or emotion. See below P. 53. L. 2.

 **P. 26. L. 21.** Wilson and Parab read कस्या पुरि which is decidedly a better reading than the old oneकस्यापुरि.  
 **P. 27. L. 12.** शापावसानेत्यादि ‘at the time when (the effects of) the ascetic's curse ceases. See **P. 37 LL. 11-14.** \[Bühler\].  
 **P. 27. L. 25.** नैष्ठिकम् "a professed student" i. e., such a one who after completing the study of the Veda stays with his teacher and becomes an ascetic, without having passed through the "Grihasthâśrama" \[Bühler\].  
 **P. 28. L. 7.** जातिस्मरत्वम्—Power to remember the incidents of a previous birth. This sort of जातिस्मरत्वाis a favourite device of this author and is taken advantage of in bringing about love marriages. For similar instances, see Ratnaprabhâ Lambaka, Taranga **IX,** verses **154-156** and also Śaktiyaśo Lambaka, Taranga **IX v. 56**, Kathâsaritsagâra.  
 For a wife in a previous birth, see the same Lambaka and Taranga, verse 233.  
 **P. 28. L. 20.** Note the double meaning of राजहंसकुलतिलक as 1st "the best of swans" and 2ndly "an ornament to the family of राजहंस' the father of the hero राजवाहन.  
 **P. 28. L. 22.** मरालमिव कुमारमुद्दिश्यऽo also in the Śâkuntala, the heroine when called away by Gautamî in the 3rd Act addresses the bower of creepers in which she was resting.  
 परिवृत्तदीनवदना Cf. आसीद्विवृत्तवदना च विमोचयन्ती &c., Śâkuntala Act **II. v. 13.**  
 **P. 29. L. 1.** बहुलपक्ष the dark half of the month. \[Bühler\]

 ** P. 29. L. 2.** रहस्यमन्दिरेIn her private apartment.

 **P. 29. LL. 1-5.** For these remedies against the 'fire of love' मन्मथानल Compare Śâkuntala Act III.  
 **P. 29. L. 13.** चन्द्रमसं वाडवानलादतितापकरं मन्ये. For a similar sentiment, compare अद्यापि नूनं हरकोपवन्हिस्त्वयिज्वलत्यौर्व इवाम्बुराशौ & तव कुसुमशरत्वं शीतरश्मित्वमिन्दोः &c, Śâkuntala Act III.  
 **P. 29. L. 13.** यदस्मिन्नन्तः प्रविशति शुष्यति पारावार; &c. The origin and the attributes of this submarine fire are thus given in the Mahâbhârata :—ततस्तं क्रोधजं तात और्वोग्निं वरुणालये। उत्ससर्ज स चैवाप उपयुङ्क्ते महोदधौ॥ २१ ॥ महद्वयशिरो भूत्वा यत्तद्वेदविदो विदुः। तमग्निमुद्गिरद्वक्रात्पिबत्यापोमहोदधेः॥ २२ ॥ Âdiparva, Chap. **196. v. 18** निजयष्टीत्यादि Compare Śâkuntala, Śloka **117.** Note the paronomasia involved in the word दोषाकर which means the moon and is in that sense brother to Lakshmî (पद्मालया).

 **P. 29. L. 24.** स्मरणीयां गतिम् Ito a state of being remembered i. e., dead.

**  P. 30. L. 4.**पादपमूलम् &c. Like a creeper to be sought after, coming to the root of the tree.

 **P. 30. L. 10.** उन्नततरुफलम् &c., Compare प्रांशुलभ्ये फले मोहादुद्वाहुरिव वामनः Raghu. I. 3.

** P. 30. L. 14.** metre Âryâ—तथा मृदुलम् as tender (as thy body is soft) \[Bühler\].

** P. 3 L. 18.** यदा केलीवन इत्यादि. Bühler had the following note on this:-"My conjecture रन्तुमनाःinstead of the senseless गतमना or मनाःof the Mss. is suggested by the expression मनोभवमर्चयन्ती रेमे **P. 25 L. 12.**" We shouldprefer to read गन्तुमनाः, 1st, because we have in line **20. P. 28.** above, केलीवने मदन्तिकमागतं भवन्तमकाण्ड एव विसृज्य मया समुचितमिति जनन्यनुगमनं क्रियते and 2ndly, we have immediately in the following sentence अपहृतमदीयमानसा सा स्वमन्दिरमगात्.It is clear, therefore, that she stole his heart when she departed. Moreover, we have gravedoubts as to the propriety of केलीवनेas Bühler's reading would seem to suggest.  
 **P. 31. L. 5.**ललनातिलकेत्यादि. If this reading is correct, the meaning must be that Râjavâhana, on seeing the trees from which Avantisundari had plucked  
flowers, the place where she had worshipped, the gravel bearing the imprint of her feet and her flower-couch, constantly called to mind that these things were 'residues' produced by her, or "mementoes of her" and thereby increased his passion, शेषम् is “any thing which has been used by another person and then abandoned, marked with the signs. of having been used." \[Bühler\].  
 **P. 31. L. 17.** सतां सख्यस्येत्यादि Compare Pañchatantra II Śloka 42; IV Śloka 107. \[Bühler\]. also संबन्धमाभाषणपूर्वमाहूःRaghu. **II. 58.**  
 **P. 32. L. 2.** महीश्वर evidently refers to राजवाहन.  
 कृत्रिमक्रिया^(०) is very plausibly understood by Kale in the sense of magic.  
विप्रलम्भ–कृत्रिमप्रेम–सहजसौहार्द–वेदिनं “Who knew deception, studied or pretended love and natural or spontaneous tenderness." Or the expression might mean "who knew the tenderness born of love, caused by separation." The latter seems to suit better, since that would show that विद्येश्वर could realise the feelings of राजवाहन

 **P. 32. L. 7.** रसभावरीतिगतिचतुरः,At page 27. L. 8. we have भावरस and here the same pair in a reverse order, रीतिगति may mean the usual mode or direction ( रीति ) गति progress or movement of the sentiment and (रस) state of mind (भाव). Godbole explains रीतिगतयः asइन्द्रनालविद्यान्तर्गताः.

 **P. 32. L. 11.** कक्षान्तरम्'the the interior apartments' \[Bühler\]. The expression properly means another apartment (अन्या कक्षा कक्षान्तरम् ).

 **P. 32. L. 14.** पिच्छिकेत्यादि. "The reading adopted is that of Professor Târânâth Tarkavâchaspati's edition which gives a better sense than that of the Mss. It may be translated "and while he together with his attendants was violently whirling brushes of peacock's feathers in circles' \[Bühler\]. The following gloss on the word पिच्छिका occurring in verse 48 of the Mallikâ Mâruta will be found interesting :—अस्याश्चैन्द्रजालिककरे क्षिप्यमाणायाः प्रेक्षकमनः प्रलोभकत्वं मन्त्रशास्त्रे प्रसिद्धम्। यथोक्तं मन्त्रखण्डे इन्द्रजालेषु श्रीनित्यनाथपादैः। सामुद्रतोयमादाय महाभाण्डे विनिक्षिपेत्। खनेत्तद्भूमिमध्ये तु मासमेकं सुरक्षितम्। तदुध्दृत्य विधानेन कज्जलेन तु पेषयेत्। अङ्गोलस्नेहमिश्रं तु उन्मूलिकरजोयुतम्। कृत्वा तु गुलिकां दिव्यां निक्षिपेत्तां नवे जले। बर्हिपिच्छेन संस्पृश्योल्लोलयेत्तु महाऽनिले। महाध्वनि समायुक्तो वडवानलसंयुतः। दृश्यते भुवनं व्याप्य महावारिनिधिः क्षणात्।.

 **P. 32. L. 16.** रत्नराजिनीराजितराजमन्दिराभोगाःwhich waved before the spacious royal palace the light (issuing from) rows of gems (in their hoods). The supposition is that cobras have a hidden gem in their hoods, which is visible only when they spread out their hoods.

 **P. 32. L. 18.** महदाश्चर्यान्वितम् “who was astonished at this great (event). \[Bühler\]. We doubt the accuracy of this explanation, since महत् which is an adjective cannot be used as a substantive. Instead of leaning upon a broken reed, it would be much better to concede at once that the author of the Pûrvapîthikâ did not understand the correct use of महत् What the author evidently meant to convey was the intense astonishment of the King andमहत् is meant to qualify आश्चर्य.  
 **P. 32. L. 23.** सकलमोहजनकमञ्जनम् a collyrium which is supposed to have the power of stupefying the spectators or onlookers. See the quotation under पिच्छिका above **P. 32. L. 14.** ante.  
 **P. 33. L. 3.** मायामानवाः men conjured up by magic.  
 **P. 33. L. 4.** गूढोपायचातुर्येण By skill in devising secret means.  
** P. 33. L. 6.** साधय Compare आपस्तम्बधर्मसूत्र **II, 3, 7, 9 and II 4, 9, 1** and the dramas. \[Bühler\].  
 **P. 33. L. 7.** सुन्दरीमन्दिरम् the apartment of the Princess. Râjavâhana had already got access to the same, vide **L. 4**. above.  
 **P. 33. L. 10.** चतुर्दशभुवनवृत्तान्तम् Compare Vedanta Sâra.  
 **P. 15** (Calc. Ed). But see also below notes on **P. 34. L. 1.** and **P. 38. L. 1.** \[Bühler\].

 It is interesting to compare Vâtsyâyana's Kâmasûtra in this connection. Says Vâtsyâyana. "वर्द्धमानानुरागां चाख्यानके मनःकुर्वतीमन्वर्थाभिः कथाभिश्चित्तहारिणीभिश्च रञ्जयेत्".  
 The following extract from Bhatta Nârâyaṇa's Pûrvâpîthikâ gives a better explanation of the narration referred to एवं च कदाचिद् गते काले भुवनवृत्तान्तं जिज्ञासुर्भगवतो नारायणस्य सृष्ट्यादिलीलाः शुश्रूषमाणा प्रश्नं कृतवती। तया प्रेरितो राजवाहनः शास्त्रप्रक्रियां पुरस्कृत्य सर्वमवर्णयत्।

The former means “a Multitude of warriors or Kings as stated in the Bhû. and the latter means 'property.' The Ahḍ. Sar, however, explains it by सेना" (Bühler). We differ. राजन्यकं च नृपतिक्षत्रियाणां गणे क्रमात् is the line quoted from Amarakośa by Bhû. but we must take अथ राजकम् from the preceding line to interpret properly the word क्रमात् viz. 'respectively.' Thu राजकम् and राजन्यकम् respectively stand for "a multitude of Kings” and "a multitude of warriors". It is clear, therefore, that Bhû. is wrong and not Paḍ. The Bhû. explains. सकोशवाहनस्य by द्रव्यवस्त्रादिगजाश्वादियुक्तस्य and the Paḍ. explains कोश by भाण्डागारम् We fail to see much difference between द्रव्यवस्त्रादि of Bhû. and भाण्डागारम् Paḍ. If at all,the Paḍ. has better authority in Kshîrasvâmi's commentary on the word अर्थौध (cited as a synonym of कोषby Amara) and is explained by Kshîrasvâmi as भाण्डागारम्, precisely the word given by Paḍ.

The Kalahaṃsa mistook Suratamañjari's pearl collar for the pith of a lotus. Hence he is called मुग्ध 'foolish.' (Bühler). We differ. It was Suratamañjari's face which was mistaken by the 'foolish' Kalahamsa for a lotus. For, the Bhû says मन्मुखनालिनत्वभ्रान्त्या कलहंसेनावरुद्ध वकत्राया ममेत्यर्थः The explanation given by the Bhû. seems to be more satisfactory.

 Naravâhanadatta, the son of King Vatsa, is the hero of the Kathâsaritsâgara and of the older Vṛihatkathâs of Kshemendra and Guṇâdhya. These works describe his adventures and especially his elevation to the throne of the Vidyâdhara Kingdom. Mânasavega, also a Vidyâdhara King opposed him, stole one of his brides Madanamañchukâ and defeated him repeatedly. The XIVth Lambaka of the Kathâsaritsâgara describes the contest between Naravâhanadatta and Mânasa vega and the final victory of the former. The above passage which has been misunderstood by the author of the Padachandrikâ, is of importance, as it shows a connection between the stories of theVṛihatkathâ and those of the Daśakumaracharita. The translation should run as follows:—"Now he (Vîraśekhara) being full of hatred against the present emperor of the Vidyâdharas, Naravâhanadatta, the son of Vatsa, who had acted as an enemy towards his (Vîraśekhara's) father, allied himself with penance-doing Darpasâra, with the hope that that (prince) would be able to injure (Naravâhanadatta)."

 My translation of वर्तमानेis suggested by the Ahḍ. Sârâmsa, which says: वर्तमाने इदमव्ययम् । वर्तमानेथ साम्प्रतम् । (Bühler).

 It appears to us that Bühler is rather hard on the Padachandrikâ. As far as we are able to make.out, there seems to be a difference of opinion between the Paḍ. and Bühler in regard to the meaning of only the two expressions पितृप्रयुक्तवैरे and वर्तमाने. The Paḍ. reads प्रवर्तमानेand takes the first part of the first expression as an Instrumental Tatpurusha ( पित्रा प्रयुक्तं यद्वैरम् ) and from the translation "who had acted as an enemy towards his father." Bühler seems to take the same as a Locative Tatpurusha. The enmity between the two is admitted, and the only question is as to who the aggressor was. The Kathâsaritsâgara has the following in this connection :-

**हर्म्याग्रे तां तदा कन्यां सतीं मदनमञ्चुकाम्।  
दृष्ट्वावतीर्य नभसः सद्यो विद्याधरो युवा॥१५॥  
योसौ मानसवेगाख्यो नामोक्त्वा समयाचत।  
कलिङ्गसेनामभ्येत्य देह्येतां मे सुतामिति॥ १६ ॥**

**तेनैतया निषिद्धेन सता गत्वा यथागतम्।  
इदानीं गुप्तमागत्यहृता सा किं न मायया॥ १७॥ XIV  
तत्र वेगवतो राज्ञः पुत्रो विद्याधराधिपः।  
अस्ति मानसवेगाख्यो राजा भुजबलोद्धतः॥ ६६॥**  
 x    x   x    x    x   x  
**माययापहृता तेन भ्रात्रा मे दयिता तव।  
रावणेनेव दुःखार्ता रामभद्रस्य जानकी॥ ७०॥**  
 x   x    x   x    x   x  
**अत्रान्तरे वेगवती व्योम्ना प्रापयति स्म सा॥ ८५॥  
नरवाहनदत्तं तं तमाषाढपुरं गिरिम्।  
बुध्वा मानसवेगस्तत्स हन्तुं तावधावत॥ ८६॥**

 So, the hostility was begun by Mânasa vega and the Paḍ.'s explanation seems to be right.  
 One more point. Bühler lays stress on the Ahḍ's explanation of वर्तमाने as an avyaya, but all the same, he translates it as 'present,' making it in effect an adjective of विद्याधरचक्रवर्तिनि Our Southern Ms. reads भावि between वर्तमाने and विद्याधर° which is a better reading, since it assigns a motive for Vîraśekhara's enmity. Parab and the Paḍ. read प्रवर्तमाने in which case पितृप्रयुक्तवैरे प्रवर्तमाने must be taken as a locative absolute construction, meaning while the enmity caused on account of the father was (still subsisting.)'

Bhûs explanation seems to be quite consistent and we have in L. 3. **P. 53** लीलाकटाक्षमालाशृङ्खलाभिनीलोत्पलपलाशश्यामलाभिः where alsoa chain or string of sidelong glances is compared to a garland of blue lotuses.

 **P. 47. L. 3**.वेशो वेश्यागृहम् तस्मिन्निर्गतानाम्। Ahḍ. Bhû. gives the same explanation, but Ahḍ. says वेशो वेश्याजनः। The authority adduced in the Bhû. and Paḍ. is the Viśvaprakâśa.\[Bühler\].  
 **P. 47. L. 4.**प्रकीर्ण प्रसृतःPaḍ. Our Southern Ms. reads प्रबलतरकेशलुञ्चनव्यथः for प्रबल°which matches better withप्रकृष्टतम in the next epithet. The effect of Nidhipâlita's distress in assuming the garb of a Digambara Jaina is heightened by the statement that he felt uncomfortable on account of the dirt on his body, but he felt more pain on account of the pricking off of his hair and suffered most on account of hunger and thirst.

Bhû. adds a verse from the Hârâvali कर्णीसुतो मूलदेवो मूलभद्रः कलाङ्कुरः। \[ Bühler \]. Note the callousness and effrontery of a hardened sinner, professing to teach men the instability of worldly possessions by robbing them!  
 **P. 47 L. 19**. अक्षभूमिः शारीस्थापनगृहम्Paḍ. 'The chequered'cloth on which the Pachîsî-men are placed'. The Ahḍ. Sârâmsa agrees with this explanation. The Bhûshaṇa, on the other hand, explains अक्षाः by पाशाः 'dice' and अक्षभूमि by तत्प्रक्षेपभूमिः The fact is, however, that the gamblers played a kind of Pachîsî (See below **P. 48. L. 3**.) where pieces similar to those used at the game of draughts, are moved forward and taken according to the results of the dicethrows, which the player makes \[Bühler \]. हस्त a throw of dice.

Bhû. Explains चूर्ण as निध्यञ्जनौषधिमूलादिचूर्णम्। The word योगचूर्ण occurs in Act II of मुद्राराक्षस, where it is intended to be administered to Chandragupta, but where the attempt is frustrated by Châṇakaya who discovered a change of colour when the mixture was put into a golden cup. Telang explains योगचूर्ण as a powder of magical virtue' (vide **P. 334.** Telang's Mudrârâkshasa). According to Wilson फणिमुखं, “snake 's head" is a sort of spade, and कर्कटक that which resembles a crab—a hook......it may be connected with रज्जु a rope with a hook at the end, by which to climb up."  
 **P. 48. L. 16.** पटभासो जालान्तरम्। पटभासः प्रेक्षणकमिति वैजयन्ती। Paḍ. Bhû. has the reading पटभाक्ष which it explains as प्रेक्षणसाधनम् and quotes पटभाक्षः प्रेक्षणकम् from the Vaijayantî. As long as no copy of the Vaijayantî is accessible, it will be difficult to decide which of the two interpretations is the correct one. The first gives, however, a good sense '' observing through a small hole of the size of the interstices in a lattice-window what was going on inside the house.\[Bühler\]. Parab and Kale have the reading पटभास, and since it is supported by our southern Ms. etc. we have adopted it in preference to पटभाक्ष^(०).

 **P. 49. L. 5.**यथार्थनाम्ने ‘Properly (so) named' (since he is rich). This word brings out clearly the antithesis implied in L. 4. above. सार्थवाहः ' a foreign merchant' \[Bühler\]. The Pa**d**. without any reference to the authority simply quotes वैदेशिकःसार्थवाहः। Bhû. quotes the following line from Amara वैदेशिकः सार्थवाहो नैगमो वाणिजो वणिक्। in which शि is simply a misprint for ह. But the Bombay Edition of the Amarakośa has वैदेहक and not वैदेहक. Mr. K. G. Oka's recent Edition of the Amara with Kshîrasvâmi's commentary also has वैदेहक,and Kshîrasvami gives the derivation of the word as विदेहे उपचये भवो वैदेहकः.The Kalpadruma gives वणिक् as the equivalent ofवैदेह and,वैदेहकand refers to Bharata's commentary on Amara and quotes Manu for an origin of the caste of Videhas. वैदेशिक by itself means a "foreigner" and it seems that the erroneous reading वैदेशिक was taken as a synonym of सार्थवाह.

It is difficult to reconcile Paḍ's. final explanation (सत्रमात्राश्रयः) when in dissolving the compound it plainly says तस्मादपगत आश्रयः। Bühler translates "Cupid, who took refuge in the covering of her coquettish glances, that resembled a forest of blue lotuses." The difficulty is obviated by taking अपाश्रय as a single word (and not a compound) in the sense of a S'hamiânâ. The Kalpadruma gives the following explanation of the word:—( अपाश्रियते आच्छाद्यते अनेन) प्राङ्गावरणं। सामियाना चाँदोया इति भाषा।This meaning suits the text better, since in the sentence immediately preceding, he has spoken of his मनः (mind) as a रङ्गपीठor stage.

 **P. 56. L. 15.** मौर्यो राजनीतिकर्ता। असुभिः प्राणैरवियोगो वियोगाभाव। Paḍ. The explanation of Maurya given by the commentary is probably wrong. Maurya is the name of the race of Kings which begins with Chandragupta and reigned from 315, B. C. not of Châṇakya, their minister, whom the commentator seems to have in his mind. The translation should run thus " Sire, the Mauryas have given this boon to the Vanias, viz., that in case they have committed such offences they shall not suffer capital punishment."\[Bühler\].

 Mark Collins says that this passage '' might indeed, be taken to indicate that Mauryas were actually ruling in Campâ at the time of the story and therefore presumably in the time of Daṇḍin. And it is more reasonable to suppose that when Dhanamitra in the story reminds the King of this Maurya-given boon, he is referring to a ruling of the King's ancestors rather than to a regulation introduced by a preceding dynasty." A Maurya dynasty is known to have been ruling in the Konkan. It was dispersed by the Western Chalukya Kirti varman I and overwhelmed by Pulikesin II and destroyed by the Tajikas. See Bombay Gazetteer Part **II, PP. 13, 283-284,335,345.**

 Any inference as to the date of the composition or the author of the Dasakumâracharita seems to us from this reference to Maurya to be improbable, since this is not the only passage in which the Mauryas are referred to. We have in the 8th Uchchhvâsa (L. 11. P. 131.) a more explicit reference to Âchârya Vishṇugupta and the Maurya King for whom the former wrote his treatise on politics. The wording of that passage is worthy of note. इयमिदानीमाचार्यविष्णुगुप्तेन मौर्यार्थे षड्भिः श्लोकसहस्त्रैः संक्षिप्ता might lead one to infer that Dandin, if not a contemporary of Châṇakya, must have lived very shortly after Châṇakya, since he uses the word इदानीम् but this is hardly tenable. According to tradition the whole work was written for the instruction of some prince and the last Uchchhvâsa (which contains the sentences quoted above) is almost an illustration of Kautiliya's scheme of politics.

 We are afraid there is some misreading here. आर्य as an honorific or propitiatory address to a King is very unusual. आर्यमौर्य might be taken as a compound,आर्य standing for Châṇakya and मौर्य for Chandragupta. But आर्य though usually prefixed to the name of Châṇakya can hardly be used alone to stand for it. Our Southern Ms. reads देव for आर्य, which is decidedly a better reading, but since it is not supported, we have retained the old reading.

 The only authority that can be found in the Kautiliya for immunity from capital punishment of the Vaisyas as a class is contained in the following couplet:—एवं चोरानचोराख्यान्वणिक्कारुकुशीलवान्। भिक्षुकान्कुहकांश्चान्यान्वारयेद्देशपीडनात्।**P. 202,** Mysore Series.

It is hard to understand how the Paḍ. takes महितin the sense of स्थूल or big when the word ordinarily means ''worshipped or "highly esteemed." The whole compound can also be taken to mean "the ivory feet of which had the shape of a lion shown in the carving, or in the in-laying, with highly esteemed and precious stones."

The word occurs in the second line of the Nândi of Veṅisaṃhâra (करैरिन्दोरन्तश्छुरित इव संभिन्नमुकुलः) where Prof. Târânâth takes it in the sense of "studded." The word also occurs in the latter half of verse 22. of Canto I. of Śiśupâlavadha (परस्परेणच्छुरितामलच्छत्री तदैकवर्णाविवतौबभूवतुः) where Mallinâthaexplains छुरिते by रूषिते which means ''tinged."

Bhû. also has this quotation, though it gives it just before अनुवेल्लितं संवृतम्।The compounds beginning with दक्षिणपाष्णीत्यादि are all Avyayibhâvâs. In explaining this difficult passage, it must be borne in mind that the princess sleeps, lying on her side in a gracefully negligent position \[Bühler\].

The readingनिमित्तis certainly better and is supported by all the Mss. but we have retained, निमित्तंbecause the Paḍ. has found an explanation for this very unusual word. Translate "With the concave of the lotus-like hand of her other creeper-like arm slightly curved (so as) to support the extremity of her head.'' निमित्तcan be taken in its ordinary sense andनिमित्त can be derived from माto measure, in which case the arm may be considered to be so curved as to suit the extremity of the head.

For the word, चिनांशुकऽee Śâkuntala Act I verse 33; Kirâtârjuniya IV. 59; Kumâra-Sambhava VII. 3; also Mâlatî-Mâdhava Act VI. P. 202. Bombay Sanskrit series, where Sir R. G. Bhandarkar explains the word as "China cloth.” The word चिणoccurs in conjunction with हुणin verse II. Act. V. Mudrârâkhasa (P. 245. Bombay Sanskrit series) where Khaśas, Magadhas, Gândhâras, Šakas and Kaulûtas are mentioned among the followers of Malayaketu, and an attempt is made by the late Justice Telang toidentify those people. China seems to have been known to the Hindus from the earliest times. चीनभूमिजाः and चीनपट्टाःare mentioned in Bk. III. of the Kautilya (See V. P. 87. Ancient Hindu Polity by Narendranâth Law.)

The same explanation of रुचकis given in the Ahḍ. comBut the Bhû. says रुचको मङ्गलद्रव्ये ग्रीवाभरणदन्तयोरितिविश्वप्रकाशः। The second explanation is the better one \[Bühler\]. रुचकऽeems to have been an ornament for the neck. Cf हारेण च महार्हेण रुचकेन च भूषितम् Bhâgavata, III. 23, 31 where, however, Srâdhara has explained it as मङ्गलद्रव्येण।

Regarding पाश in the sense of "beautiful, excellent" See the Peter Dict. S. V. \[Bühler\]. According to native grammarians, पाशin composition has three meanings:(1) with words meaning hair, पाशdenotes collection (पाशः पक्षश्च हस्तश्च कलापार्थाः कचात्परे Amara-Kośa II. 3, 98 ). The Śâśvata has खगादिबन्धने पाशः समूहे केशपूर्वकः। कर्णपूर्वोपि शब्दोयंकर्ण वदति शोभनम् 140 शाश्वत कोश (2) after कर्ण it denotes beauty. Kshîrasvâmi quotes a verse from some unknown author, stringing all the meanings of पाश as follows: अग्रतोबाहुपाशेन। केशपाशेन पृष्ठतः। पार्श्वयोः कर्णपाशेन। सर्व तोब्न्धनं प्रिये। Besides these two (3) it has its ordinary meaning of a noose or chain. पाशः केशादिपूर्वः स्यात्तत्सडेःकर्णपूर्वकः। सुकर्णेचेति मेदिनी. Cf. सैवोष्टमुद्रा स च कर्णपाशःUttara. VI 27. This substantive पाशis distinguished from the Taddhita suffix पाशप् under Paṇini's Sûtra (याप्ये पाशप् V. 3. 47) of which भीषकपाश छात्रपाश &c. are instances.

Bhû. "Her loosened and disordered braids reddened by the cluster of rays, emitted by the jewels that served as ornaments to her (other) beautiful ear which was turned upwards." \[Bühler\].

 पाटलःश्वेतरक्तः। उत्तराधरः उत्तरोष्ठः।Paḍ. This compound is rather hard to understand. Our southern Ms. has बिम्बंin place of, विवरम् but all the other Mss. read विवरम्and we have retained it. The general sense seems to be that 'the halo of her lustrous complexion made the space between the upper and lower lip. (विवरम्) ‘indiscernible.’If we read बिम्बम्, we must understand that the two lips were undistinguishable.The difficulty is that though अधरusually means the lower lip,उत्तरis very rarely used in the sense of the upper lip. But we have the authority of Kâlidasa who in Kumâra Sambhava V. 83. says पुनर्विवक्षुः स्फ़ुरितोत्ताराधरः। If lip is not understood after उत्तर,as we do afterअधर, the compound gives no meaning.

 P. 62. L. 12.संक्रान्तो मिलितः।Paḍ. संक्रान्तो बिम्बितः। संक्रान्तोबिम्बितः समाविति वैजयन्ति। Bhû. Ahḍ. The first explanation is preferable, as the hand which supports the cheek,looks like an ornament for the ear. \[Bühler\]. We prefer to take संक्रान्त in the sense of बिम्बित, because (1) it gives better sense, inasmuch as the circumstance of the hand being reflected in the cheek clearly heightens the transparency of the complexion and the longish shadow of the hand which was under the cheek seemed like a pendant.(2)We are also supported in this interpretation by the following instances from the Kâdambarî (a)स्तनसंक्रान्तेनात्ममुखेन (P.170 Kale's Edition)(b)अपसव्यजानुकरतलावलम्बिताविमलमणिकुट्टिमोदरसंक्रान्तप्रतिमः ( Ibid.

The flowers of the painted or embroidered canopy of the bed, which were reflected by her mirror—like cheek looked like Tilakas and other ornaments such as women paint on their faces. \[Bühler\]. It may be noted that the comparison of the upper cheek to a mirror in this compound lends support to our interpretation: ofसंकान्तin the preceding note.

For writing or drawing, boards are used even now in India, which are covered with the gum of some tree or some other gluey substance. On this the letters or figures are drawn with a brush (tûlikâ) (or now with a stick) in white or other colours. The interpolator who wrote निर्यासवालुकाकल्क (see the critical notes) apparently did not know this method, but thought of the more common one which consists in covering a gluey or varnished board with fine sand and to scratch the letters on that with a stick. \[Bühler\]. नागदन्तलग्रmeans that a painted board like this was hanging from a peg (नागदन्त). He drew a picture of her in the posture in which she was then sleeping and of himself with his hands clasped in supplication at her feet.

Ahḍ. explains पारिजातकम् by यक्षकर्दमम् according to the Amarakośa. Bhû. explains अलक्तपाटलेन by अलक्तकं पाटलं यस्मात्। अत्यन्तरक्तमित्यर्थः। The latter explanation is preferable to that given by the Pad. \[Bühler\]. To us, Bhû.'s explanation seems to be farfetched. It might mean deep red but we doubt very much if that colour will suit a likeness of चकवाकbirds, which Apahâravarma has to draw on the Chunam—plastered wall. The proper colour will be श्वेतरक्त of (reddish white) or pale red. The ruddy or Brâhmini geese in classical Sanskrit literature stand as emblems of constancy in love.*Vide* रथाङ्गनाम्नोरिव भावबन्धनं। बभूव यत्प्रेम परस्पराश्रयम्। (Raghuvaṃśa,**III.24**). Were these birds painted on the wall? The author does not say so, but merely mentions सुधाभित्तौ. Apahâravarma improvised पाटलor 'white red' or 'rose colour' by chewing betel-leaves, scented catechu and a piece of camphor, the usual ingredients of a ताम्बुल. Did Apahâravarma spit thiswhite red saliva upon the pair of चक्रवाकbirds already painted as some have suggested? Would not this procedure have been an affront to the girl he loved so passionately? Vâtsyâyana in his Kâmasutra (Ch**.** VI**.** P**.** 299. Nirṇayasâgara Edition) says “यत्र संपातोऽस्यास्तत्र चित्रकर्मणस्तद्युक्तस्य द्वयर्थानां गीतवस्तुकानां क्रीडनकानां कृतचिन्हानामापनिकानामङ्गुलीयकस्य च निधानम्। प्रत्युत्तरं तया दत्तं प्रपश्येत्। ततः प्रवेशने यतेत। Thus according to Vâtsyâyana, a lover courting a girl is recommended four devices of communicating his wish to his beloved (1)To paint his own likeness on a board or wall (सानुरागमात्मानं फलके भित्तौ वा विलिख्य निदध्यात् says यशोधर the commentator of कामसूत्र).This Apahâravarma has done. He has also addresed (2) an amorous ditty to her (गीत). The third is क्रीडनकानां पुत्रिका कन्दुकादीनां कृतचिन्हानां निधानम्। This read with काष्ठमेढकयोश्च संयुक्तयोश्च स्त्रीपुंसयोरजैडकानां......प्रच्छन्नं दानम् (*Vide* P. 211) seems to suggest the presentation of something suggestive of love, and hence it appears to us that Apahâravarma fulfilled (3) this third condition by ''spitting the reddish saliva on the chunam-plastered wall (in such a way as) to produce the likeness of a pair of चक्रवाक birds.” This interpretation seems to us all the more plausible, because, immediately after this spitting on the wall comes the exchange of rings,which according to Vâtsyâyana is the fourth device indicative of love.

Bhû. विधिना विध्युक्तप्रकारेण। Paḍ. आथर्वणis not uncommon in Bâṇa's writings in the sense of 'domestic chaplain.' The fact that the Ath.Veda is essentially a book of charms is no doubt the reason why the adherents of this Veda were selected by the Kings as priests.See also KâmandakîNîtisâra, IV.32. \[Bühler\]. The word अथर्वन्is derived by lexicographers from अथ (लोकमङ्गलाय) अर्व्यते (प्रस्तूयते) यत्. Charitravardhana commenting on the word अथर्वनिधेः in Raghu1, 59. says आथर्वनिधिपदेन दुरितोपशमनिमित्तशान्तिपौष्टिकमिति। Dinakara adds पौरोहित्योचितत्वं द्योत्यते. Vijayaganîin the same place observes वशिष्ठश्चतुर्दशविद्यानिधानं तथाथर्ववेदस्य कर्माणि कुवर्न्नथर्वनिधिः कथ्यते. Yâjnyavalkya has the following on the choice of a पुरोहित. पुरोहितं प्रकुर्वीत दैवज्ञमुदितोदितम्। दण्डनीत्यां च कुशलमथर्वाङ्गिरसे तथा and the Mitákshara explains the word अथर्वाङ्गिरसे as शान्त्यादिकर्मणि. The mere fact that Vaśishtha was the family priest of the Raghus is sufficient to show that a family priest need not be ar adherent of the Atharvaveda proper.

 **P. 77. L. 18.** The Yavana Khanati was probably an Arab or Persian trader,as it is not likely that in Dandin's times there was a direct trade between Greece and India \[Bühler\]. Later resea rches and especially Râdhâkumuda Mukerji's History of Indian Maritime Activity clearly establish trade relations between India and Greece. The Daśakumâracharita appears to us however, to be a work of a much later time. The name खनतिitself looks very suspicious.

 Is it possible that by a clerical lapse the compound word खानेति (खान+इति) was transcribed as खनति? Our Southern Ms. has सभीति नाम्नो which might be असक्+इति नाम्रो. If this surmise be correct, the name could clearly be taken to stand for a Mahonedan trader and it would be possible that the appearance of this name खान or असफ़्might be an additional link in the chain of evidence assigning to the author a far later date than the sixth century A. D.

 The word शतहलिऽeems,however,to be a proper name from its use as such in L.17.Page 78.

 The Paḍ. does not cite the authority for its explanation of गृहपति as ग्रामाध्यक्ष. The vague mention of a कोश is not sufficient when सत्रीand गृहपतिare given as synonyms by Amara and the commentators of that Kośa have explained the word asसदान्नादिदानकर्ता. The verb is in the sing, and we have therefore to take गृहपति, अन्तरङ्गभूतः and जनपदमहत्तरः all as epithets qualifying शतहलि. It is better, therefore, to takeगृहपतिin the sense of "a charitably disposed house-holder." If we take it in the sense of ग्रामाध्यक्ष, we must assume that शतहलि was both "head of the village"and 'minister of the interior.'

The plea, it is needless to observe,obviously savours of the well-known maxim of the 'end justifying the means.” Châṇakya, the Machiavelli of ancient India, lays down the following aphorism which may have influenced the conduct of Upahâravarma and also Râjavâhana's approval of the same:—धर्ममूलत्वात्कामफलत्वाच्चार्थस्य धर्मार्थकामानुबन्धायार्थस्य सिद्धिः सा सर्वार्थसिद्धिः। Vide Kautiliya, Mysore Edition P. 359.

The Bhû's explanation does not seem to be correct,nor is Peterson's reference much to the point.The word इषुकामशमीappears in the Kâsikâ under three Sûtras of Paṇini, viz. दिक्संख्ये संज्ञायाम् (II. 1. 51 ), दिक्पूर्वपदादसंज्ञायाम् (IV. 2-7), and प्राचां ग्रामनगराणाम्(VII. 3-14) and in the explanation given by the Kâsikâ as well as the Siddhânta Kaumudi,the word इषुकामशमी is quoted as the name of a village, and इषुकामby itself does not appear to be the name of a province. Nor does the context seem to support the mention of a particular province, since we have in the next linea दैवच्छन्दानुवर्ती which is more in accord withकामचरःThe Paḍ. and the Ahḍ. respectively explain the expression as पूर्वदेशेषुकामचरः स्वेच्छागमनकर्ता and पूर्वस्यां दिशि यथेष्टचरः and this explanation must be accepted until an authority is found for इषुकामas the name of a country.

The only Śûdraka of whom we know anything is the one mentioned, in the Introduction to the Mrichch hakatika, as the King of Magadha and author of the drama.''

 The text says only this much that "Gopakanyâmarried in a previous birth by Śaunaka was the same as Aryadâsî and Târâvali, and that the son who was born to you as Sûdraka by Aryadâsî was born to me.” This son was brought up by Vinayavati, and that the same son through the force of affection was born again to Kântimati and being deserted by her was handed over by Târâvali to Vasumati as mentioned at **P. 10. L. 4**. Thus as far as this passage goes we can only say that Kântimatî, Târâvalîand Aryadâsî were three different incarnations of the same individual, but in L.4. on the next page Somadevi, Sulochanâ and Indrasenâ are also mentioned without any reference to their relationship. So also तारावलीis mentioned as a co-wife with कान्तिमतीin **L. 22. P. 84.**

 **P. 83. L. 13.** मत्तकाशिनीमुत्तमाम् Paḍ.

 **P. 83. L. 15.**सस्मितम् "Because she knows his real motive" \[Peterson\]. The insinuation implied by Peterson does not seem to be supported by what follows, since even after कामपालis introduced into the royal palace, he does not hasten to meet his love, but only tries to take revenge upon चण्डसिंह. It is only तारावली who in jest misconstrues his motive.

** P. 83. L. 17.** प्रस्फुरन्तं कम्पन्तम् (?) Paḍ.

 **P. 83. L. 19**. अनुवृत्त्या सेवयाPaḍ. Some take this to mean "an equally desperate act.” But अनुवृत्ति might here be taken in the sense in which it is understood in grammar, viz., "a subsequent or supplementary rule, completing what a preceding one has left to be explained." Thus the sense might be "I have come to wipe off or atone for that offence by my subsequent conduct" that is by making the consummation valid or legal by a formal marriage by retrospective effect." If अनुवृत्ति is taken as सेवा, the latter word must be considered as having an ironical force.

 **P. 83. L. 20.** तवार्थपालस्य (!) Paḍ. Here again कामपाल and अर्थपाल*i. e.,* father and son are confounded by the commentator!

 नहि "Without (undergoing) such a load (or head) of adverse fortune, I should not have been worthy.'' \[Wilson\] This is not right. भाग्यं is the good fortune acquired by merit. "I who am poor in merit, and am therefore without any such good fortune,'' etc. Compare the passage in Kâdambarî **P. 61. L. 23.** foll. \[Peterson\]. Both Wilson and Peterson seem to have missed the point. हि assigns a reason or the corrective statement noted in the preceding note. तादृश and अस्मादृश are contrasted and refer respectively to तारावली and कान्तिमती. The latter upbraids herself as अल्पपुण्यand attributes her present good fortune in finding her long lost son to the good offices of तारावली who is “a heap of good fortune" (भाग्यराशि).

L. 6.** अर्थपाल has told पूर्णभद्र "पितरमुज्जीव्यतदभिरुचितेनाभ्युपायेन चेष्टिष्यामहे.” अर्थपाल, therefore, seems to seek his father's instructions as to the "purpose or design" and Kâmapâla's reply in the following lines outlines so to speak the "plan of the campaign."

Having won over (उपसंगृह्य) to our side those who are already resentful and having encouraged his old enemies and having also incited his natural enemies, that is, enemies by consanguinity,we shall extirpate him who is hard to subdue." See Kâmandaka. XIII. 58, where a सहज enemy is explain ed सहजः स्वकुलोत्पन्न इतरः कार्यजः स्मृतः। The following verses from Kâmandaka XXVII. throw considerable light on this passage.

**अलब्धवेतनो लुब्धो मानी चाप्यवमानितः।

The Bhû.'s explanation is certainly more plausible than that of the Paḍ. The quotation from the मिताक्षराis applicable only in a limited sense. कामपालhad no kingdom which could be harassed, or from which supplies could be cut off. We must therefore understand that कामपालwas besieged in his own residence from which supplies were also cut off. It may be noted that the word पारग्रामिक does not occur in the text of विज्ञानेश्वर.

 **P. 94. L. 17.**कुलचारित्रबन्धनपाशविभ्रमेणैकवेणीभूतेन केशकलापेन With the mass of her hair not made up into a braid under the apprehension that that was in conformity to the rule of virtuous conduct worthy of a noble family. The tying up of the hair during separation from the husband was strictly forbidden by etiquette. Cf. मुखमसकलव्यक्ति लम्बालकत्वान्। Uttara Megha, 21 where Mallinátha explains लम्बालकत्वात्संस्काराभावाल्लम्बमानकुन्तलत्वात्। Hence the frequent reference to एकवेणी;Cf. नीलनागाभया वेण्या जघनं गतयैकया Râmâyaṇa, AyodhyâKâṇda X, Sundara Kâṇda XV and Yuddha Kánda. XXXIII. The commentator in his gloss on the second of these passages says :—एकया हरणदिनकृतैकसंस्कारवत्या। The last passage from the Râmâyaṇa is explicit.(अचिरान्मोक्ष्यते सीते देवि ते जघनं गताम्। धृतामेकां बहून्मासान्वेणीं रामो महाबलः). So we have in Raghu-Vaṃśa XIV. 2. वनान्नि-वृत्तेन रघूद्वहेन मुक्ता स्वयं वेणिरिवाबभासे। So also in Kumârasambhava II, 61 मोक्ष्यते सुरबन्दीनां वेणी वीर्यविभूतिभिःMallinâtha in his commentary on the first of these passages quotes from Hârita न प्रोषिते तु संस्कुर्यान्न वेणीं च प्रमोचयेत्।

 Śakuntalâ is introduced in the seventh act of the Śâkuntala as एकवेणीधराand Dushyanta describes her there as नियमक्षाममुखी धृतैकवैणिः।

In Meghadûta Part II, verse 23 we have उत्सङ्गे वा मलिनवसने where Mallinâtha quotes from some Smṛiti प्रोषिते मलिना कृशा. In the verse quoted in the preceding note from Śâkuntala Act VII, Śakuntalâ is described as वसने परिधूसरे वसाना. A प्रोषितभर्तृका (a woman whose husband is abroad) is described as wearing

**वासस्तदेव वपुषो वलयं तदेव हस्तस्य सैव जघनस्य च रत्नकाञ्ची॥**

 It appears, therefore, that a change of garments or the daily toilet and the usual decoration of person were forbidden by etiquette and the author in describing the appearance of Târâvali on the day following the nocturnal visit of Pramati to Navamâlikâ seems to conform to the usage above referred to. We may therefore translate the expression as under, "Wearing the soiled lower garment and bodice (नील+अंशुक+चीर) and (the same) bracelet पतिव्रतापताका = पतिव्रताषैनयन्ती—"the best of a dutiful wife."

** P. 94. L. 19.** क्षामक्षामा greatlyemaciated. Cf. क्षामक्षामकपोलमाननम् Śákuntala III. 8.

 **P. 95. L. 4.**वो जननी—भवत्पित्रपेक्षया कनिष्ठस्य पितृव्यस्य पत्नी Bhû. With reference to this statement, Wilson at p. 22 of his Introduction to this work observes as follows:—

 "The fifth section relates the adventures of Pramati, who is here represented as the son of Kâmapâla by the Yakshiṇi Târâvali, and not, as in the Introduction, the son of Sumati. Artḥapâla is there also called the son of Târâvali, while as we have seen in the preceding narrative, he is described as the son of Kântimatî. Either the author has been nodding, or the Introduction is the work of a different writer, who has been heedless or forgetful of the narrative of his predecessor. We are told by the author himself a little later. P. 96. L. 4. कथं मत्सुत एवायंवत्सस्यार्थपालस्य प्राणभतः सखा प्रमतिरिति। These two statements taken together leave no doubt as to the author's intention of making Pramati the son of Târâvali and Artḥapâla the son of Kântimatî. Kântimatî and Târâvali are both spoken of as co-wives of Kâmapâla (P. 84. L. 22). The Bhû. in its comment seems to have to have been guided by the statement contained in the Pûrvapîthikâ. In the Ms. copy of another Pûrvapîthikâ which purports to be a work of one Bhaṭṭa Nârâyaṇa (Dec.Col. collection No. 32. 1873-74)occurs the following mention of the parentage of Artḥapála:—श्रैमतमन्त्रिमुख्यधर्मपालसूनुकामपालात्कान्तिमत्यां गूढोप्तन्नो रहस्यभेदभिया त्यक्त इति निशम्य निवेदितो x x x x राज्ञार्थपाल इत्यभिधानेनानीयत प्रसिद्धिम्.This is consistent with the statement contained in the Text.

(Siddhachandra प्रत्यादेशो निराकर्ता। प्रत्यादेशो निराकृतिरिति कोशः). Śhankar Pandit explainsप्रत्यादेशः as meaning literally 'that which orders back.' that one of two or more things standing in a line which orders( आदिशति) the rest to go back(प्रति) or remain behind owing to their inferiority and itself comes forward on account of its own excellence. \[Peterson\]. "The usual meaning of this word is contradiction;here it means 'humiliator', 'rival'. So in the Vikr. loc. cit Wilson. Pandit's attempt to go behind the accepted meaning is ingenious. Wilson's explanation of प्रत्यादेश as contradiction is not supported by Native lexicons. The Amarakośa cites प्रत्याख्यान, निरसन, प्रत्यादेश and निराकृति as synonyms. The word simply means rejection or interdiction, e.g., प्रत्यादिष्टविशेषमण्डनविधिःŚâkuntala, Act. VI. 6 इतःप्रत्यादेशात्स्वजनमनुगन्तुं व्यवसिता Śâkuntala, Act.

Perhaps the author had in his mind Manu's famous couplet पिता रक्षति कौमारे भर्ता रक्षति यौवने। पुत्रश्च स्थाविरे रक्षेन्न स्त्री स्वातन्त्र्यमर्हति॥

 It is interesting to note that the Brahmin पाञ्चालशर्मा allows his daughter to grow up until she has passed her girlhood (मुक्तशैशवानाम्). Pramati disguised as a girl must surely have looked taller and stouter than most marriageable Brahmin girls of this day !

 **P. 99. L. 11.**अगर्ति who is helpless.Wilson's reading of गणपति for our गणयति leaves no verb to govern वृद्धं ब्राह्मणम् and consequently gives no meaning. Nor is his reading of अगतिमतिथिम् supported by other Mss.

He is वैवस्वत मनु according to the Râmâyṇna:—आदिराजो मनुरिव प्रजानां परिरक्षिता. According to the Mahâbhârata, he is आदिराज, son of अविक्षित. अविक्षितः परिक्षित्तु शबलाश्वश्च वीर्यवान्। आदिराजो विरागश्चशाल्मलिश्चमहाबलः। Âśvamedhika Parva 101, 40. Compare आदिराजयशोबिम्बंInI. 5. of Daṇdi's Kâvyâdarśa where one commentator explains the word as भरतभगीरथादीनाम्। and another as मान्धातृप्रभृतीनाम्। The former renders आदिराजानाम् as दीर्घकालातीतानाम्।

The difficulty in accepting this interpretation is in regard to the formation of the compound श्रीभुज्, which is possible only under इगुपधज्ञाप्रीकिरः कः \[Paṇi. III. 1. 135\]. Possibly, there is a reference to the formula recited at marriages in which the bride-groom is spoken of as नारायणस्वरूपी and the King is here requested to worship the Brahmin youth as his own son-in-law. If we are correct in suspecting a reference here to the ritual of marriage as at present practised, this will be one more instance of the comparative modernity of the work.

Since the 64 arts are frequently mentioned in Sanskrit Literature, and since some of these are particularly referred to in the following two lines, we extract below the names of these arts according to Vâtsyâyana and give the commentator's explanation of each name:—

** (१) गीतम्         **

**{ स्वरगं पदगं चैव तथा लयगमेव च।  
{चेतोवधानगं चैव गेयं ज्ञेयं चतुर्विधम्॥**

** (२) वाद्यम्**

**{ घनं च विततं वाद्यं ततं सुषिरमेव च।  
{कांस्यपुष्करतन्त्रीभिर्वेणुना च यथाक्रमम्॥**

** P. 102. L. 1.** Wilson reads मित्रगुप्तश्चाचचक्षे\[Peterson\].

 सुहृत्साधारणभ्रमणकारणःCf. सुहृद्भिरेककर्मा P. 80. L. 1.

 सुह्मेष्वग्निकोणदिक्स्थेषु Bhû. सुह्मhas been identified by some with the modern Arrâkân. But since दामलिप्त which according to the हेमकोश was another name forताम्रलिप्त(the modern Tamluk, a port near the mouth of the Ganges,) is here mentioned as being situated in सुह्म, we may consider सुह्मas the southern part of modern Bengal.

 **P. 102. L. 3.** वीणावादेन.

 वीणा ''सा तु तन्त्रीभिः सप्तभिः परिवादिनी" Amara. Evidently this was a seven-stringed instrument unlike what is commonly now known by that name and which has only five strings.

 **P. 102. L. 7.**विस्मृतविन्ध्यवासरागम् who forgot her fondness for residence in the Vindhya mountains.

 **P. 102. L. 8.**विन्ध्यवासिनिA name of Durgâ as the goddess of the Vindhya mountains; a celebrated temple to her under this appellation is in the neighbourhood of Mirzapur." \[Wilson\].

 **P. 102. L. 10.** पाणिग्राहकमनुजीविष्यति will be a dependent of her husband.

 **P. 102. L. 11.**अपरिणयनाद्विवाहाभावत्Paḍ.This is a fair index of the intelligence of this commentator. The construction of course, is आपरिणयात् until her marriage, \[Peterson\]. कन्दुकनृत्येन कन्दुकवन्नृत्यं तेनPaḍ. This too does not seem to be right, since a ball or कन्दुकis specifically mentioned in the next paragraph. कन्दुकनृत्यwas evidently a dance and play with a ball combined. It must have been something like the musical drill of our time.

 **P. 102. L 15.**कन्दुकावती। मतौ बह्वचोऽनजिरादीनामिति दीर्घः संज्ञायाम्।सोमापीडां चन्द्रशेखराम्Вhû. "Wearing the moon as her diadem.'' \[Wilson\].

 **P. 102. L. 16.** धात्रेयिका। धात्र्युपमाता। तत्कन्या धात्रेयिका। Bhû.

 **P. 103. L. 2.**निरुष्मताम्"Bohtlingk does not recognise this word. Wilson and the Calcutta Ed. read निरुष्णताम्." \[Peterson\].

 Our Southern Ms. reads निरुष्मताम् The word उष्मा is recognised in Hindu medical works for bodily heat, and consequently there can be no objection what ever against the formation of the word निरुष्मता।

 पापमाचरितुम् seems tobe a better reading than वैरमारोपयितुम् of our Southern Ms.

 **P. 103. L. 3.**सुदृष्ट सम्यग्दृष्टम्।Bhû. See also note P. 113. L. 16.

 **P. 103. L. 7.**नृशंसो वेशः Wicked are prostitutes.

 **P. 103. L. 9**. संपन्नशस्यं प्रचुरधान्यम्Paḍ.

 **P. 103. L. 15**. अनिषिध्ददर्शनाऽप्रतिहतदर्शनPaḍ.Open to public view or without purdah.

 **P. 103. L. 19.**अतिष्ठच्च सा &c. Wilson considers the passage as obscure and suggests the following translation ''Although seen by me, a different person, and at a distance, she took her place imme diately in my heart." It may be seen that in thus interpreting the passage Wilson omits the privative नand makes अन्येन to qualify मया. Some takeअन्तराले to mean "passage from where she stood to my heart."

 Peterson translates "The moment I saw her she was in my heart, though neither I nor any one else saw her pass from where she stood to my heart." This translation takes no account of प्रथमं अपश्यम्in the preceding sentence. We prefer to think that अन्तरालdenotes "interval in time" as in Uttararâma. Act I. 31. (बाष्पाम्भःपरिपतनोद्गमान्तराले). The latter part of the sentence means that “she was not seen by me or any one else during the interval" that is, after she was seen seated on the bejewelled platform and (took her place in my heart) and the moment she began to dance. Our southern Ms. reads अन्यैव for अन्येन which too does not give a good meaning. Wilson reads अन्येन च.

 **P. 103. L. 20.** चित्रीया विस्मयोद्भुतमितिकोशःPaḍ. किमियमित्याद्याक्षेपालंकारः। आक्षेपः स्वयमुक्तस्य प्रतिषेधो विचारणादिति लक्षणात्। Bhû.

 **P. 103. L. 21.** भुक्तपूर्वा&c. "Lakshmî, who as the bride of Vishṇu, the Purâtana-pumân and as the Goddess of fortune, has been enjoyed by former sovereigns" \[Wilson\].

 **P. 103. L. 22.** अयातयामम् unenjoyed. जीर्णे च परिभुक्तं च यातयाममिति द्वयम् Amara III 145.

 **P. 103. L. 23.**व्यत्यस्त "With the palms downward'' \[Peterson\]. This is hardly right.Before beginning her play, the heroine is making her bow to the Goddess and she touches the ground (स्पृष्टभूमि) with the extremity of her leaf-like hand (हस्तपल्लव) the palm being (naturally) reversed (the dorsum touching the ground).

 **P. 104. L. 2.**अमन्दरागरुषिताक्षम्।The ball, of a kind still used in Kattywar, is covered with red spots. It is compared to Ananga, not to the eye of Ananga as Wilson has it \[Peterson\]. रुषिताक्षं
रञ्जितम्Bhû. A play seems to be intended upon the wordअक्षwhich as अक्षि means the eye and रूषिताक्ष can in that sense very well be an epithet of Ananga, but we have not been able to find an authority for अक्षas meaning “a spot.”

 **P. 104. L. 3.**मन्दोत्थितम्When it (the ball) gently rose or rebounded. कुञ्चिताङ्गुष्ठेनetc. Having struck it with her leaf-like hand, the forefinger being slightly bent and (the other) fingers being out-stretched.

 **P. 104. L. 4.**हस्तपृष्ठेन चोन्नीयHaving given it a jerk with the dorsum (of her hand).

 चटुलदृष्टिलाञ्छितं marked by her swift glances and hence like a cluster of flowers followed by a row of bees. आकाश एवाग्रहित् Caught it aloft as it was falling.

 मृद्वमृद्विती softly and forcibly (alternately).

 **P. 104. L. 7.** चूर्णपदम् गत्यागत्योरानुलोम्यं न्यूनाधिक्यक्षेपणं तच्चुर्णपदम्। Paḍ.उदपातयत् sent it flying. विपर्ययेण च प्राशमयत् Made it stop by striking it in the opposite direction.

 **P. 104. L. 8.**पर्यायेणाभिघ्नती striking it respectively with the left and right hand as it came sideways or straight. गीतमार्गम् दशपदचंक्रमणं गीतमार्ग विदुः। Paḍ.

 **P. 104. L. 10.** अनेककरणमधुरमनेकव्यापाररम्यम्।Paḍ.

** P. 104. L. 11.** उच्चावचाः स्थूलसूक्ष्माःPaḍ. उच्चावचमनेकभेदम्।उच्चावचं नैकभेदमित्यमरः। Bhû.

 **P. 104. L. 12.**तत्क्षणारुढविश्रम्भम्In whom confidence was engendered at that moment. The reading before the author of the Padachandrikâwas प्रतिक्षणाख्ढविभ्रमम् which he explains as प्रतिक्षणमाख्ढ उत्पन्नो विभ्रमो विलासी यस्येति तथा। But the reading selected by us gives better meaning, since it assigns a cause for her resting her hand upon the shoulder of Kośadâsa.

 **P. 104. L. 13.**कण्टकितं रोमाञ्चितम् Paḍ. तत्प्रथमा &c.तत्प्रथमं तदेव प्रथममवतीर्ण आगतो यः कन्दर्पः कामस्तेन कारिता कटाक्षदृष्टिर्यस्याः सेति तथा Paḍ.

 **P. 104. L. 15.**श्वासानिलवेगान्दोलितैःAs if striking (i.e., warding off) the bees eager to taste the fragrance of her lotus-like mouth, by means of the toy-leaves formed of the cluster of rays issuing from her lips which were vibrating by the motion of her breath.

 **P. 104. L. 16.** मण्डलभ्रमणेषुIn making her rounds.

 **P. 104. L. 17.** विशन्तीव पुष्पमयं पञ्जरम् As if entering a flowery cage.The coloured ball spun its rounds with such velocity that it seemed to make a cage of flowers round about her.पञ्चबिन्दुप्रसृतेषु। पञ्चावर्तप्रहारस्तु पञ्चबिन्दुरुदाहृतः। Paḍ.

 **P. 104. L. 18.** गोमूत्रिकाप्रचारेषु। गोमूत्रिकेति विद्वद्भिश्चारः शातहदोमतः। Paḍ.

** P.104.L.19.**भूषणमणि etc.With her step answering to the time kept by the sound of the precious stones in her ornaments.

 **P. 104. L. 20.** अपदेशास्मित etc. Her Bimba-like or ruddy lips being bathed as it were by the light of her feigned smile.

 अवस्रसितetc. With the mass of her hair first hanging down and then put in its place again आघट्टित (in a way) in which the string of her sounding and jewelled girdle was tightened (made even आघट्टितःसमीकृतः according to Bhû.) अञ्चितोत्थित etc. In which the skirt of her garment hanging down from her large hips was whirling as she rose gracefully.

 **P. 104. L. 22.**आकुञ्चितप्रसृतetc. In which the beautiful ball was hit by her creeper-like arm which (as required) was contracted, stretched out or curled up.

 **P. 104. L. 23.**आवर्जितबाहुपाशम् In which her arms were bent. परिवर्तितetc. In which her dishev elled hair falling on the lower part of the spine were put back, or in which her dishevelled hair fell on the lower part of the spine which was slightly turned sideways.

 **P. 105. L. 1.**अवगलितetc. In which her play was not interfered with by the haste with which the golden sockets of her drooping ear ornaments were replaced.

 **P. 105. L. 7.** एकेनैवानेकेनेवWith one (ball) as if there were many. This idea is the same as is referred to in the following verse ascribed to Vararuchi and quoted according to F.W. Thomas in Bhoja-Prabandha:—

**एकोपि त्रय इव भाति कन्दुकोयं  
कान्तायाः करतलरा गरक्तरक्तः।

 **P. 105. L. 20.** सोयमार्येणाज्ञाकरो जनोetc. "This your honour's obedient servant (meaning herself) is exretmely obliged." अनुगृहीतःhas an ironical force, halfjesting, since we haveस्मेरयाin the preceding sentence and she is evidently merry at the prospect of being turned into a female monkey in this very birth.

 **P. 106. L. 12.**उपकार्येाध्व्रगृहम्.Paḍ."An Upakâryâ is a tent. Cf. Raghuv. V. 63:” \[Peterson\] But since उपकार्या is given first as a synonym of राजसदन thereis greater propriety in taking it here in that sense especially since Mitragupta is described as having had his bath and dinner and also sleep in that place. It is quite likely that the word is used here for a pleasure-house or summer-house in the garden. In the verse from Raghuv. to which reference is made by Peterson, Mallinâtha the commentator explains उपकार्याम् as राजभवनम् and adds "उपकार्या राजसद्मन्युपचारचितेऽन्यवद्" इति विश्वः।

 **P. 108. L. 23.** स्वमांसासगपनीतक्षुत्पिपासाम् “Whose hunger and thirst were appeased by his own flesh and blood." The whole of this story is based with a few changes upon another related by Gomukha to Naravahanadatta in Taranga IX. of Lambaka X. of the Kathâsaritsâgara verses 1—40. In verse 6 occur the following expressions भार्या क्लान्तां क्षुधा तृषा। अजीवयत्स्वमांसास्रैः। which show that Dandi not only borrowed materials for the story but even some of the expressions.

  **P. 108. L. 24.** निकृत्तपाणिपादकर्णनासिकम् “Whose hands and feet and ears and nose were cut off." The Kathâsaritságara has छिन्नहस्तपादचतुष्टयम् (v. 9) and निकृत्तहस्तचरणौ (v. 12).

 **P. 109. L. 3.** रोपितव्रणम् "Whose wounds were healed.” Cf. बध्वा व्रणपट्टिकाम्.

 **P. 109. L. 14.** विकलिकृतोभिमतःऽupposed to have beenmaimed. \[Peterson\]. We prefer to take अभिमतःin its ordinary sense of "worthy or esteemed" and consider it an adjective of भिक्षुःIf the author had intended the meaning sought to be given to the expression by Peterson, we should have had विकलीकृतत्वेन or at least विकलीकृत इति (अभिमतः). That the cripple was अभिमत to धन्यक is shown by the word भत्सिंता in L. 5. ante and पर्यश्रुः पादपतितः in L. 16. below. भिक्षुःmay be taken in its ordinary sense of "mendicant"or as one of that (Buddhistic) order". We incline to the latter opinion, because the story in the Kathâ. in the original is a Buddhistic story and the husband ofधूमिनी being a follower of Buddha referred to the cripple by the usual appellation of भिक्षु. Our southern Ms. omits अभिमतः।

 **P. 109. L. 18.**विरुपितमुखी "Whose face was disfigured.'' In the KathâV. 40 we have छिन्ननासिकाम् श्वभ्यः पाचिका पुट पाककत्रीं Paḍ. "a woman of a degraded class"

Some take अभिमृशन्as "touching" but there seems to be no propriety in "touching" the platters. We see from the context that Śaktikumâra was keenly watching everything that गोमिनी was doing and it would be more in keeping with his character if we understand अभिमृशन्as "closely observing'' or ''contemplating" what गोमिनीintended to do with the wet platters.

 Wilson's note on the passage is more apposite. "All the senses were gratified, the eye by the condensed vapour on the pitcher, the ear by the sound of the drops, the touch by the cold feel, the nose by the fragrance and the tongue by the sweetness."\[Wilson\].

 **P. 112. L. 15.**करकेणWith the water-pot of an ascetic or student.आचमनम्The sipping of water before beginning the performance of a religious rite or before and after meals. Bhâradvâja describes the process thus:—

**आयतं पर्वणां कृत्वा गोकर्णाकृतिवत्करम्  
संहताङ्गुलिना तोयं गृहीत्वा पाणिना द्विजः।  
मुक्ताङ्गुष्ठकनिष्ठाभ्यां शेषेणाचमनं चरेत्

 This sipping of water is prescribed after (1) bath, (2) drink, (3) sneezing, (4) sleep, (5) meals, (6) after walking the streets, (7) change of clothing. स्त्रात्वा पीत्वाक्षुते सुप्ते भुक्त्वा रथ्योपसर्पणे।आचान्तः पुनराचामेद्वासो विपरिधाय च॥

 **P. 112. L. 18.**एतदनपेक्षःNeglectful or indifferent to wards her (गोमिनी).

 **P. 113. L. 1.** त्रिवर्गे। त्रिवर्गो धर्मकामार्थैरित्यमरः। Bhû.

 This ideal of a dutiful wife is repugnant to a cultured mind.Even poetical justice would demand the expulsion of the concubine, if she was introduced only to test the steadfast virtue and the wifely devotion of, गोमिनीbut the author was evidently one of those who permitted any licence to the sterner sex and exacted meek submission and absolute resignation to the will of the husband from the wife. The story has rather an abrupt ending and disappoints the reader.

 **P. 113. L. 3.**सौराष्टेषुThe modern Kâthiawâr वलभी—a town in the East of Kâthiawâr about 25 miles west of Bhâvanagar and about 25 miles north of Śatruñjaya. The modern name of the town is Valeh (Bombay Gazetteer, Vol. I. part 1. Gujerath, p 78.)

We do not see why we should not take सुदृष्टा in the same sense in the context now before us.Her husbahad conceived such a dislike towards her that he did not like to see her (न तां पुनर्द्रष्टुमिष्टवान्) L. 6. above. Also ज्ञातिवर्गे मामवज्ञयैव पश्यति in the sentence immediately preceding this. Hence the most natural meaning appears to be "make me one whose sight is welcome" अदृष्टin a technical sense does indeed denote प्राक्तनजन्मसंस्कारः but it is not necessarily adverse, nor is दृष्ट used in the sense of fate.

We prefer to take निर्व्यूढ in the sense of समाप्तम् in which sense the Śabdakalpadruma quotes the following from जटाधरः—अवदानं तु यत्कर्म निर्व्यूढमतिशोभनम्। निर्व्यूढ etymologically means "carried to end'' as in UttaraRâmacharita, Act I हा तात निर्व्यूढस्तेऽपत्यस्नेहः। We have also in the Veni-Samhâra Act VI. निर्व्यूढदुर्धरप्रतिज्ञाभारस्य... वृकोदरस्य.

 **P. 116. L. 3.**लक्ष्म चैतद्दक्षिणपार्श्ववर्ति। It is difficult to make out the meaning of this sentence. Mitragupta is looking at the picture which Kalahakaṇtaka is holding in his hand. The Paḍ. is silent, the Bhû. explains लक्ष्म asनखक्षतरूपं चिह्नम्. How this could be shown in a picture or how it could be made out by anon-looker it is difficult to understand. The Ahḍ.'s note is as follows:—अलब्धभोगपर्याप्तिस्वैरिण्याश्च गोत्रयोरिति। दक्षसंघेत्वसूर्यत्वविरतें स्वयमितिबृहत्कथायाम्.

 We have not been able to trace this verse in the Brihata-Kathâ but content ourselves with suggesting an interpretation which to us appears more straightforward than is offered by either of the two commentators. The inference drawn in the next sentence is that the husband must be an old man. अनतिपरिभुक्त accounts for the first part of the inferenceviz. old age. And we conjecture that the दक्षिणपार्श्ववर्ति लक्ष्मmust do the same for the husband being a Bania. Now, we know that Bania women unlike other Hindu women carry the end of their Sâree over their right arm and right shoulder and the wearing of the garment in this fashion constitutes the लक्ष्मor mark which leads Mitragupta to conclude that she; must be the wife of an old Bania.

** P. 120. L. 2.**संस्थितजनदाहस्थानसंसक्तस्य। संस्थितो मृतः। Paḍ. Note the exigency to which the author has been put under the self-imposed restriction of avoiding all labials. मृत having a labial has to give place to संस्थित, and श्मशान or पितृवन the more familiar word is also under a ban for a similar reason. The periphrasis here used is but one instance of the "Shifts and turns" to which but for the trick above referred to "the mind has to resort” for what could have been conveyed more directly and more intelligibly. So also कान्तारं for वर्त्मदुर्गमम्, and धरणिज for महीरुह or पादप or विटपी etc.

 **P. 123. L. 18.**नरेन्द्रस्य मन्त्रवादिनः। नरान्तरस्य राज्ञ इत्यर्थः। Paḍ. Wilson omits नरेन्द्रस्य and च and explains नरान्तरस्य as referring to the Râja.The नरेन्द्र of our reading is the Râja as in L. 20. In line 19 the word is used in the sense of sorcerer. \[Peterson\]. There is some confusion here. Peterson should have said thatनरेन्द्रin the compound नरेन्द्रसार्थसंग्रहणेनmeans sorcerer.

 We have corrected आयस्यति of the old cdition to आयस्यति. The Paḍ. had. the reading आयस्यति which it explains as यतते and derives it from यसु प्रयत्ने. Our Southern Ms.as well as Wilson reads आयस्यतिwhich certainly gives better sense than the prophecy which is implied in the future tense of याwith आ.The reading आयस्यति is also more consistent with न चास्ति सिद्धिःwhich follows.

Wilson is certainly wrong in interpreting in this note नरकशासनas Yama. नरक was the name of a demon who was killed by Vishnu who is on that account frequently mentioned as नरकान्तकः,नरकजित् etc. The triad of gods mentioned in the text has therefore nothing singular about it.

 “One incident of the story" says Wilson (P. 27. Introduction)" the transformation of the person, is repeated from the story of Upahâravarma; but the narrative is peculiar in the locality of the incidents, the sea-coast of Kalinga, and in making Andhra, the ancient Teliṅgaṇa, a maritime power. There is also an allusion to the predominance of heretical opinions, either Buddhist or Jain in Andhra.”

 This transformation or rather the substitution of another man in the place of one deliberately murdered in an underground cellar is possibly suggested by the story of तरुणचन्द्रa physician who under the pretext of curing विनयशील, King of 'Srî-Kanṭha, of old age induced him to reside in an underground cellar, and as the King instead of making more flesh only wasted away, the physician killed him and having introduced into the cave by a subterranean passage a young man, caused him to be accepted as the King transformed by his medication. The following couplets from the story will be found interesting:—

 **P. 129. L. 11.** विदर्भो नाम जनपदः। The modern Berar. Vidarbha "seems to have reached from the Krishṇânorth nearly to the Nerbudda. It is included in Mahârâshtra" (Konow's Karpuramañjari P. 213).

 According to Mark Collins (P. 40. Geog. Data of Daśak.) the Southern boundary of Daṇḍin's Emp re (Vidarbha) was either along the Krishṇâor along the Varadâ and Tuṅgabhadrâ rivers. On the East it was bounded partly by Kalinga and possibly Kosala, and partly by Ândhra, under which name we must understand the Eastern territory between the Krishṇâand the Godâvari. Within this area there must be assigned the six feudatory Kingdoms of Vidarbha. These six Kingdoms are Aśmaka, Kuntala, Murala, Richika, Konkaṇa and Sâsikya or Nâsikya.

 The Nalachampu of Trivikrama Bhatta (who flourished between750 and 850 A.D.) besides mentioning Kuṇdina as being situated on the Varadâ and as being the Capital of the Vidarbha country (देशानां दक्षिणो देशस्तत्र वैदर्भमण्डलम्। तत्रापि वरदातीरमण्डनं कुण्डिनं पुरम्) (Uch. II.  
  \[ 43 D. K. \]

P. 69. Nirṇaya Sâgar Ed.1907) and after referring to the hermitage of Bhârgava as being to the West of Vidarbha, gives the Setu between India and Ceylon as the Southern boundary, the Vindhya as the Northern, and the sea on either side as the Eastern and Western limits of Vidarbha (आसेतोः कपिकीर्तनाङ्गशिखरादाराश्चविन्ध्यावधेः। आपूर्वापरसिन्धुसीमविषयः Uch.VII v. 3. P. 244. Nirṇ. Sâg. Ed.)

 भोजवंशºAn ornament to the dynasty of Bhoja..Wilson would infer from this that this work or at least this chapter was composed subsequent to Bhoja's death unless the introduction of his name. were meant as a compliment to the Râja.

 Pandit R. V. Krishṇamâchârya, also known as Abhinava-Bâṇa, the learned editor of Subandhu 's Vâsavadatta, in his critical notes on some of the classical Sanskrit poets refers to a tradition current among Panditas to the effect that this reference in the text points to a degenerate scion of the Bhoja dynasty तादात्विकः कश्चन भोजवंशीयो विगीतचरितो राजकुमार एवानेन कविना विश्रुतचरितमुपनिबध्नता मनसिगूढमाकलित इति सर्वतः प्रवादः प्रथते (P. 50. Daṇḍi and his works).

 Mark Collins who has raised his elaborate hypothesis to prove, if not the contemporaneity, at least the proximity in time of Daṇḍin and Kâlidâsa on the basis of this mention of a descendant of Bhoja, surmises that the predecessors of the Vâkâtakas who ruled in Bhojakata were probably given the surname of Bhoja by tradition-loving Hindus.

 अंशावतार इव धर्मस्य The Supreme Being or some abstract virtue is often spoken of as desce nding upon this Earth (अवतारः) and manifesting itself in full (पूर्णः) or in part (अंशः). In the present instance Puṇyavarmâ is described as the partial manifestation of Dharma or righteousness in the same sense in which Kâlidâsa describes Raghu and Aja as अपवर्गमहोदयार्थयोर्भुवमंशाविव धर्मयोगतौ( Raghu VIII. 16 ). So also we have in the same poem धर्मार्थकाममोक्षाणामवतारइवाङ्गवान् (X. 84. )

**न्यायेनार्जनमर्थस्य वर्धनं रक्षणं तथा।

 **P. 129. L. 21.** तदायतिस्तस्मात्पुण्यवर्मण आयतिः प्रभावो यस्येति स तथा। स्यात्प्रभावेपि चायतिरित्यमरः। Paḍ. V. S. Apte takes तदायतिः in the sense of one "descended from him.” Others explain the word as “ who owed his prosperity to him (hisfather). There is no reason to understand प्रभावin the very unusual sense of 'descent' especially since some adversative force is intended in the following sentence (**स सर्वगुणैः समृद्धोपि दैवाद्दण्डनीत्यां नात्याद्दतोभूत्**). For the same reason, the other interpretation too seems inconsistent. We would, therefore, render तदायतिः "Possessed of his power or valour." This meaning agrees well with the minister's opening remark on the next page सर्वैवात्मसंपदभिजनात्प्रभृत्यन्यूनैवात्रभवति लक्ष्यते (P. 30. L. 1). For आत्मसंपत् the Bhû.refers to verses 23-24 quoted in note on L. 21 above.

 **P.130.L.3.**अप्रतिपद्यात्मसंस्कारम्। The following couplets from the Kâmandakîya throw conside rable light on this expression:—

**आत्मा प्रयत्नादर्थेभ्यो मनः समधितिष्ठति।

**विज्ञानं हृदयं चित्तं मनोबुद्धिश्च तत्समम्।

**प्रयत्नज्ञानसंस्कारा आत्मलिङ्गमुदाहृतम्॥३१॥**

 **P. 130. L. 23.**कुमारसेवकः कुमारावस्थायाः प्रभृति सेवकःPaḍ. & Bhû. Here begins that famous harangue which has justly attracted the notice of Eastern and Western scholars. Kumâradatta's caricature of Kautilîya has been noticed by the Editor of the Kautilîya in his preface. "The arguments which are urged by one of his favourites,” says Prof. Wilson, "in behalf of idle pleasures, and in detraction of grave advisers and ministers, while they speak the language of the profligate in all ages, afford some curious insight into the abuses of official authority which prevailed in Indian government at the time of the composition."

 The introductory part of this harangue reminds one of a similar occasion improvised by the author of the Naishadhiya (Vide Canto XVII verses 37-96) for a similar diatribe in which orthodox Brahmanic teaching is burlesqued in the same strain.

The Laghu-dîpikâ after explaining the words as परिमाणाविशेषौgives an alternative meaning as under:—अथवा कृत्स्नायव्ययप्रदेशोवशिष्टमात्रगणनायुक्तोर्घमुष्टिः। कृत्स्नावान्तरस्थलविषय आयादिचतुर्विधगणनायुक्तो मुष्टिः। Since the whole passage is a parody of the कौटिलीय, we must interpret मुष्टिमर्धमुष्टिं वाभ्यन्तरीकृत्यin the light of Châṇakya's precepts. Now, Chânakya says दिवसस्याष्टमे भागे रक्षाविधानमायव्ययौ च शृणुयात् (Adhik I. Ch. 19.) So the two things that a king has to attend to in the first three hours of the day is the safe custody and examination of (the ledgers of) Receipts and disbursements. According to the alternative meanings given by Bhû. मुष्टिऽeems to have been an officer who examined or audited the accounts of a province or district (जनपदायव्ययशोधकः) and अर्धमुष्टिa similar officer for village units. If we accept this interpretation, we must interpretअभ्यन्तरीकृत्यas "taking into confidence" one or other of the officers named above. If we take the alternative meaning suggested by the Laghu-dîpika, मुष्टि seems to be amode of counting the receipts, in which case अभ्यन्तरीकृत्य may mean checking before custody. In  
 \[44 D. K. \]

either caseअभ्यन्तरीकृत्यdoes not seem to mean ''throwing down into (the belly)" a meaning which V. S. Apte has given to the expression. It looks all the more absurd when taken with क्षालिताक्षालितमुखेन as if a king were recommended to eat a handful or so even without washing his face." We have the same expression again (न मामासन्नकार्येष्वभ्यन्तरीकरोति) at P. 134. L. 15. where it clearly has the meaning we have assigned to it.

 **P. 133.

 प्राहसीत्etc. Vihârabhadra was present in the harem when the King recapitulated all that the old minister had said to him. Vihârabhadra's harangue deriding the study of the Sastras and especially the study of दण्यनीतिwas indeed meant as a reply to the old minister but it derived additional piquancy from the laugh which he raised amongst the women-folk by his caricature of Châṇakya's precepts.

Parab reads सुलभभङ्गिwhich would mean crooked speeches, easy to make out, but this meaning would bemuch too flat. Thesouthern reading सुलग्नgives no good meaning. TheBhû. seems to have read सुभुग्नभङ्गिin which case भुग्नand भङ्गिboth having the sense of 'crooked' would sound tautological. भुजङ्गभङ्गिwould be the best reading, since the author seems to have intended an alliterative effect by bringing together अङ्गना, भङ्गि, भग्न &c, but we have retained the old reading because there is no authority for a change.

Jayamaṅgala in his commentary on the वात्स्यायनकामसूत्र says कोङ्कणविषयात्पूर्वेण वनवासविषयःThe Paḍ. and Ahḍ. both explain वानवास्यः as वनप्रभुः but cite no authority. Wilson reads. वानवास्याम् The text adopted by us seems to be correct, since it is supported by the commentaries as well as by our Southern Ms.

** P. 138. L. 9.**अश्मकेन्द्रःThe King of the Aśmakas. The Aśmakas, though placed by Varâhamihira in the North-West (Br. S. XIV 22) are mentioned along with आन्ध्र and ऋषीकin XVI. II. They are included by Mr. C. V. Vaidya amongst people inhabiting Hindustan proper or North India (Epic India Note II. P. 482). Nundolal Dey who has supplied the map prefixed to Râdhakumud Mukerji's Fundamental Unity of India has shown their country to the West of Janasthâna and south of Devagiri. ''A tribe of Aśmakas or

 Assakas was settled at the time when the Suttanipâta was composed on the banks of the Godâvari. This is no doubt the same tribe whose name appears in inscriptions at Ajantâ of about the sixth century A.D. and they therefore probably occupied land near the sources of this river in the Western Deccan, South of Berar." (Mark Collins Geog. Data p. 42)..

 **P. 138. L. 15.** परामृशति originally means 'touches., Here the sense is 'defiles.'

 **P. 138. L. 16.** मुरलेशम्"The name (Muralas) occurs in an inscription found at Bhera Ghat on the Narmadâ but among others equally unknown or of such divergent parts that we derive no hint as to the location of this tribe. In the Raghu, a river Muralâ or Marulâ is mentioned in connection with the country of the Keralas and it is possible that the Keralas of this passage are the same as Daṇḍin's Muralâs. But to identify these with the Keralas of the extreme south is hardly warranted by the data of his romance.” (Mark Collins Geog. Data of Daśak. P. 43). Nundolal Dey gives Narmadâ as another name for Muralâ. The Trikândaśesha gives Marundalâ (मरुन्दला) as a synonym of Muralâ but this does not

help us to locate that river. Dr. S. K. Belwalkar in his Marathi translation of Bhavabhûti's UttaraRâmacharitam conjectures that the Muralâ must have been a tributary of the Godâvari near Pañchavati. (see 3-5 P. 132). See however extract from KâvyaMîmâmsâ for this name in our Note on नासिक्यनाथम्On the next page.

 **P. 138. L. 17.** ऋषीकेश्वरम्The reading of the old edition was ऋचीकेश्वरम्but since our Southern Ms. and B. and C. cited inthe old edition have ऋषीक° for ऋचीक, and the name ऋषिकis found in the Râmâyaṇa (IV. 41)and the Mahâbhârata (Bhîshma Parva, Chap. IX, v64) and also theBṛihat-Saṃhitâ (XIV. 14), wehave preferredऋषीक as the more satisfactory reading.

 As regards the position of the Rshîkas, we find these people placed immediately before Vidarbhas in the description of Jambudvîpa, though they are also mentioned along with the Kâmbojas in the North (Bhîshma Parva, XXV, 26). They are more definitely mentioned in the Râmâyana in the following line: विदर्भानृषिकांश्वैव रम्यान्माहिषकानपि। The countries named by Sugrîva in the context before and after Rshîka seem to point to some order in the enumerati on.The Bṛihat-Saṃhita mentions the Rshîkas among Southern peoples (XIV. 14) and Dravidas, Videhas, Ândhras, Âśmakas, Bhâsâpuras and Konkanas are all strung together in one verse in XVI. II.

 Gorresio's reading माहिषिकीम् for माहिषकान् seems to be wrong, since it neither gives good meaning nor suitsthe context.There is the further difficulty of taking Mâhişikî as Mâhismatî and to reconcile the interpretation when Avanti is mentioned in the context immediately before Vidarbha.

 The Bombay recension of the Râmâyaṇa no doubt gives ऋष्टिकas another reading for ऋषिक and it would be risky to identify the Rshîkas with the Rattis on the slender authority of an alternative reading unsupported by any collateral evidence.

 कोङ्क्णपतिम्Konkaṇa is here rightly taken by Mark Collins to stand for for the sea-coast country which ''began about Chaul or Chemval in the Kolaba District twenty miles north of Bombay and appears to have extended over the whole of Kolaba and Thana.”

 नासिक्यनाथम् The other readings here are hard to make out. Mark Collins refers to the named सासिकbeing found in the Bhîshma Parva Ch. IX but the word there isशशिकाः. Mr. Vaidya's list of countries does not give the name. The name साहसिक्य has not yet been traced by any one. असिकis found in the Bṛihat-Saṃhitâ(असिकेशं भौजङ्गेXI. 56.) but there is nothing to guide us in locating this tribe. The only satisfactory reading is नासिक्यwhich is mentioned in the following verse कर्णाटमहाटवि चित्रकूटनासिक्य कोल्लगिरिचोल्लाः। क्रौञ्चद्वीपजटाधरकावेर्यो। Bṛihat-Saṃhitâ, XIV. 13. Nâsikya is the present Nâsik on the Godâvari. The following extract from the काव्यमीमांसाmentions all these countries except ऋषीक माहिष्मत्याः परतोदक्षिणापथः। यत्र महाराष्ट्र माहिषकाश्मकविदर्भ कुन्तल x x x मुरलवानवासक x x x नासिक्यकौङ्कण......प्रभृतयो जनपदाः। See P. 93.

See तत्कोशवाहनमवशीर्णम् in L. 24 below where अवशीर्णम् must be taken in the sense of 'scattered or fleeing here and there in the tumult of the battle.'

** P. 138. L. 21.** काञ्चनकुङ्कुमकम्बलानाम् Wilson notices the reading काञ्चनकुङ्कुमपलानाम्, taking पल in the sense of a ' measure of weight. Probably saffron-coloured goldinterlaced woollen garments, that is, shawls are meant.

 **P. 138. L. 24.** नयद्वेषादामिषत्वमगमत् Fell a prey on account of his hatred of political science. To fall a prey is a common expression, eg., रन्ध्रान्वेषणदक्षाणां द्विषामामिषतां ययौ Raghu XII II.

 **P. 140. L. 1.**नयावलिप्तमश्मकेन्द्रं नयेनैवोन्मूल्य Having rooted out by nothing else than policy Aśmakendra who prided himself upon his policy. The Paḍ. reads नयावलिप्तमश्मकनयेन the last word being explained as पाषाणोन्मूलनेन which certainly does not make better sense than the reading in our text.. The author is playing upon the wordनय.

 **P. 140. L. 4.**त्रीनीषुनतीत्य It seems that the hunter aimed three arrows in succession at the two deer but the latter succeeded in out-running the range of each.

 **P. 140. L. 8.** अतक्षिषम्must be taken in the sense of ''satisfied" a very unusual sense. Wilson's reading अतार्प्सम्is certainly the best, though it is unsupported by the Mss. The Paḍ. reads अतार्षम्which it explains as अतिक्रान्तवान्, but it may be noted that the form अतार्षम् is itself very irregular.

 **P. 140. L. 9.**माहिष्मतीMaheśvara on the right bank of the Narmadâ forty miles to the South of Indore. It was the capital of Haihaya or Anupadeśa, the Kingdom of the myriad-handed Kârtavîryârjuna of the Purâns.

Dict. takes this word to mean 'wealth, money, property' in this context. We would go a little further than Wilson and take मात्राin the sense of "paraphernalia" and not merely clothes, since परिच्छदwhich is given as a synonym of मात्राincludes as applied to a King not only all the emblems of royalty but even the usual accompaniments of regál splendour, such as elephants, horses, chariots, &c.

** P. 142. L. 9.**अनुरञ्जितातपे समये about the time when sun-shine had become red. We have a parallel expression in Śiśupâla-vadha IX. 7, where the hour of dusk is described as:—वरुणस्य दिशा भृशमन्वरज्यदतुषारकरः Si. IX. 7.

** P. 142. L. 10.** संहृत्सafter having finished or gone through. जनसमाजज्ञानोपयोगीनि। Wilson notices जनसमाजोपयोगीनि as the reading of his Mss. B. and D. The wordज्ञान seems almost redundant, but since all the Mss. including M. have that reading, we have retained it. Wilson translates the expression as “actions or performances suited to the knowledge or taste of an assemblage of people." The reading adopted by him in his edition viz., जनसमाजज्ञानोपयीगी does not make better sense, nor is it supported by the other Mss.

 नानारुतादि the reading of A instead of नानारुदितानि is certainly preferable, for the sounds made by birds and beasts are usually imitated and not their "weeping.” हस्तचंक्रमणं हस्तयोरितस्ततः प्रसारणं भ्रमणं वा। Paḍ. This appears. to mean walking on two hands resting on the ground and with the feet held aloft in the air.
