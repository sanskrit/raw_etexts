**PREFACE.**

![](../books_images/U-IMG-1726300246789.jpg)

 The following is a Popular Edition of the Hitopadesha of Bhatta Nârâyana containing full explanatory notes, a glossary of words and a literal translation of all the verses occurring in the text and the dissolution of compounds adapted to meet the requirements of the less advanced students. By a Popular edition is meant such a one as can be easily understood without the help of a teacher even by a student who has studied the first few lessons of the 2nd book of Sanskrit Series. It is thus hoped that it will be largely availed of by the generality of students and especially by those who study privately and for whom it is chiefly intended. An experience of some years as a teacher of Sanskrit has convinced the editor that a book of this kind now presented would be generally acceptable. Hence he thinks that the publication of the book meets a long-felt want. It is prepared on the model of the Five Tantras or Panchatantra, which has been before the public for the last 3 years.

 No pains have been spared to make this book useful to those for whom it is intended.

 Any suggestions as to the meaning of a particular passage or individual words will be deemed a favour.

**१** They say (it is said) that of all the worldly acquisitionsor things, that of learning is always by far the best(or pre-eminently the best) by reason of the impossibility of its being taken away, of its pricelessness and its inexhaustibility. अनुत्तमम्—नास्ति उत्तमं यस्मात् that to which nothing is superior. अहार्यत्व is an abs. noun अहार्य the pot. pass. participle from हृ 1 P. अनर्घत्व from अनर्घ न. त. **२** संगमयति &c.Learning alone, *though possessed by a low person* (नीचगापि); introduces (or unites) him to a king who is difficult to be seen (दुर्दर्शं) and thence to fortune, as a river *though flowing down a slope* (नीचगापि) takes a thing or person to the inaccessible (दुर्दशं) sea. For संगमयति,other editions read संयोजयति, the former being the caus. of गम् with सम्, A. नीचगा = नीचं गच्छति नीचे वर्तते या सा (in the case of learning) and नीचैः गच्छतीति or नीचं प्रदेशं गच्छतीति (in the case of a river ). For दुर्दर्शं the reading is दुर्धर्षं, which means that which cannot be dared or approached. **३** Learninggives modesty or cultivates the understanding, through ,modesty or intellectual discipline one attains worth (worthiness), through worthiness one obtains wealth, through wealth one is enabled to perform religious actions (*lit*.obtains religion or religious merit) and thence (that is, through religious merit) one obtains happiness. ददाति = सृजति, उत्पादयति.पात्रता and पात्रत्व are abstract nouns from पात्र ( a fit object. for anything) by the two differrent terminations, वा and त्व.

                        *

**१** The two kinds of lore, *viz*., that of arms and that of any science, lead to respect or honour, the first of these (*viz*., शस्त्रस्य विद्या) gives riseto ridicule in oldage, while the second is ever respected. The first line is differently read as विद्या शस्त्रं च शास्त्रं च &c. where the meaning remains the same, the twonouns शस्त्रं and शास्त्रं being in apposition to विद्या प्रतिपत्तये हास्याय &c. Mark the idiom, the verbs भवति or अस्ति being, understood after these datives. आद्रियते is pass. of द् 6 A. with आ. आद्या—द्वितीया being equal to प्रथमा-द्वितीया, the first, and the second or the one and the other. **२** Since the impressions made (लग्नः) on a raw or fresh earthen pot, cannot .be effaced (*lit*. cannot be otherwise), so ( तत् ) royal policy
(or politics) is taught to youths in this work (इह्) in the shape of stories. यत्—तत् since—therefore. कथाच्छलेन=कथारूपेण. बालानां कथ्यते=बालेभ्यः कथ्यते. इह=अस्मिन्ग्रंथे. **३** मित्रलाभः (acquisition of friends), सुहद्भेद (separation of friends), विग्रह(hostility or war ) and संधि (peace) are written upon (लिख्यते) or treated of, (in this work), after making extracts (आकृष्य) from the Panchatantra and other works पंचतंत्र is the well-known work ofविष्णुशर्मन्.in which worldly wisdom is taught. It is divided into five parts or तंत्राऽ, the whole collection being designated पंचतंत्र पंचानां तंत्राणां समाहारः पचतंत्रम्० द्विगु० आकृष्य being drawn or extracted from **४** अस्ति=आसीत् an instance of a historical present in Sanskrit **५.** पाटलिपुत्रनामधेयम् (ब) पाटलिपुत्रं नामधेयं यस्य तत्. **६** Endowed with all the qualities of a lord, (and hence a king ) सर्वैः, स्वामिगुणैः उपेतः, स्वामिगुण is a ष० त०.

**१** सुदर्शन is a proper name, but like other similar names in Sanskrit it has a meaning. It is a Bahu. compound शोभनं दर्शनं यस्य सः. **२** It is the present participle of the Pass.of पठ् 1 P. and means, being recited. **३** श्लोकद्वयम्—श्लोकयोर्द्वयं ष० त० A pair of slokas or verses that is, two verses. **४** It is the 3rd P. Sof Perf. ofश्रु **५** Learning(*lit*. science) is the remover or the solver of various doubts, shows things hidden from view and is the eye or guide of all; and he who does not possess it, is surely blind. अनेक &c. is उपपद० अनेकान् (न एकान्न० त०) संशयान् उच्छिन्नतीति. परोक्षः अर्थः—Absent objects. **६** Even one of these *viz*., youth, the possession of riches, lordship or mastery, and thoughtlessness, leads to calamity; how much more calamitous will the collection of the four be? धनसंपत्तिष० त०. किमु how much more or how much less—here of course it means the former. For a full explanation ofकिमुor किमुत्त see Student's Guide to Sk. Composition. चतुष्टयं= चतुष्कं acollection of four *Cf*. द्वयं. **७** Having heard— absol. from कर्ण्with आ 10. **८** Of those who had not studied, theShástras अनधिगतानि (न पठितानि ) शाखाणि यैः तेषां व०This and the following genitive go with अननुष्ठानेन **९** Of those who always went astray or took to bad ways. उन्मार्गगामिनः**-** उन्मार्ग गच्छन्तीति उन्मार्गगामिनः तेषां उप० **१०** शास्त्राननुष्ठानेन० ष० त० अननुत्रान न० त० By the absence of the study of Shastras. **११** Dejected at heart. टद्विग्नमनाः उद्विग्नं मनः यस्य. ब० **१२** चिन्तयामास Thought; Peri. Perf. of चिंत् 10 P. and A.

** १** What is the good of a son being born who is neither learned nor pious? Of what use is an eye that is blind—except that it is an eyesore? The use of the particles किम् or the pronouns कः &c. with the instrumental is of frequent occurrence. The meaning in each case being-what is the use,good, or advantage of ? *e.g*.किं मया, किं तेन, किं त्वया &c... **२** Of the three, *viz*, unborn, dead and foolish (sons) the first two are preferable to the last, (for) the first two cause grief only once, while the last does it at each step. The use of वरं (derived from वृ 5 P. to choose) followed by न in the sense of *better than* is very common.**३** Moreover. **४**He is (really) born by whose birth the family attains to elevation ; for (I should like to know) who that is dead is not born again in this ever revolving world? that is, every one who dies is born again. This is the doctrine of पुनर्जन्म according to which beings are born again and again until in the form of man, in which by obtaining highest religious merit, they get मोक्ष (salvation). **५** If a mother is said to have a son in that man for whom the little finger ( कठिनी ) does not fall at once ( सुसंभ्रमात्) at the commencement of (the act of) counting the number (गण) of the men of merit, say what woman is barren? The meaning is, that the mother who gives birth to a son who is insignificant, is as good as barren . गुणिगण &c. गुणिनां गणानां गणनायाः आरंभं ष० त० सुसंभ्रमात् hastily, unhesitatingly. यस्य = यस्य कृते. For भवति some editions readनाम ; in that case नाम meansindeed!

**१** Moreover. **२** He whose mind is not known to be intent en, or engaged in, charity, penance, bravery, learning and the acquisition of wealth, is nothing but the excrement of his mother (that is, as worthless as &c.). एव merely. **३** A single meritorious son is better than a hundred foolish ones; (for) the moon alone destroys darkness which even a collection of many stars cannot do. मूर्खशतानि ष० त०; so also तारागणः. **४** The son of that man, who has practised very severe penance somewhere in aholy place, will be obedient, prosperous, pious and talented. **५** The acquisition of wealth, being always free from diseases, a beloved wife, a sweet-speaking wife, an obedient son, and learning productive of useful results—these six, oh friend, are the blessings of this worldly existence.Here there is & difficulty in the reading प्रिया ; प्रियः which is found in some editions, solves the difficulty, as प्रियः means a friend, he being one of the six. अर्थागमः ष० त०. For तात another reading is राजन्. **६** Who is happy or blessed by having as many sons as the (number of) measures (आढकै) required to fill up a granary (कुशूः) ? even one, who is the support of the family and on whose account the father becomes. famous (*lit.* is heard ), is better. कुशूलापूरेण &c. कुशले आपूरणं–येषां ते कुशूलपूरणाः, तेच आढकाः येषां कुलस्यालंबो यस्मिन् सः

** १ **A man of merit, be he the son of anybody, is respected. What can a bow, though made of the best bamboo, do, when it is (निर्गुण) stringless? Here there is a pun upon the words वंश and गुण.वंश—(1) Good family. (2) Bamboo गुण–(1) Merit. (2) A string. The meaning is, as a bow, made of the best bamboo but without the string, is useless, so a man though born of the noblest family, is useless, when without merit. यस्य कस्य–of any one whatever, that is, insignificant. वंशविशुद्ध. (1) Purified by noble birth (in the case of man ). (2) Made of a strong bamboo. This verse is omitted in the Calcutta edition. **२**Now. The words तत्कथंare omitted in the Calcutta .Edition.**३**And what is also said (is as follows). **४** Life ( or duration of life ), actions, wealth, learning and deaththese five are created or appointed, while yet a man is in the womb.अपि here has the sense of exclusion—all these five excluding others. गर्भस्थस्य देहिनः Gen. absolute construction=गर्भस्थे देहिनि. **५.** Things destined necessarily to happen, do happen even to the great; (for example) nakedness of Nilakantha and the lying downof Hari on the great serpent. अवश्यं भाविनः—अवश्यं भवन्तीति, उपपद. महाहौ शयन सं० त०. **६** That which is destined not to be, will not be; if it is to be, it will not be otherwise. Why should this antidote against the poison of anxiety, be not drunk ?चिंताविधं(कर्म) हन्तीति = चिंताविषघ्नः- उपपद.

** १**  Of those whoare unable ( अक्षम ) to do work.**२**Words uttered through laziness or dullness.**३** Having thought of (confided in) fate, one should not leave off one's effort or industry. One will never obtain (*lit* does not deserveto get) oil from sesamum without efforts ( made to extract oil.) दैवमिति संचिन्त्य=दैवं अस्तीति विचार्य or दैवस्योपर्यंवलम्ब्य. अनुद्योगेन न० त० This verse is not found in the Calcutta Edition.**४** For as with only one wheel a chariot cannot move (*lit*. there will be no motion to a chariot), so without manly efforts, fate does not succeed. **५** The action performed in the previous existence is said to be fate; one, therefore, should make exertions with manly efforts without slothfulness (very diligently).**६** The goddess of wealth approaches that man-lion who is industrious; it is the cowardlythat say that a thingwill be given them by fate ; having, therefore, set aside (*lit*, killed) fate, make efforts with all your might. If anything does not succeed even when efforts are made for it, what fault is here? that is, who is to blame here or in this case? पुरुषसिंह (क.) पुरुषः सिंह इव,कापुरुषाः (क.) कुत्सिताः पुरुषाः**.**

** १** Just as a potter (maker) makes whatever he wishes to make from a lump or ball of clay, so a man gets (प्रतिपद्यते) the fruit of the actions done by himself (previously)**.२** Even seeing a treasure come before a man by sheer accident (काकतालीयवत्), fate does not take it up (आदत्ते) of itself, but requires some manly effort on the part of the man to do so. काकतालीयवत् means accidentally-from the fiction of a crow sitting on the branch of a palm tree and the latter falling down that very moment.अग्रतः– before a person, अपेक्षते–expects, wants and hence requires. **३**For undertakings succeed by industry and not by mere wishes; animals do not themselves enter the mouth of a sleeping lion, that is to say, even a lion in order to get his prey is required to make efforts. सप्तस्य gen.of the pp. of स्वप् 2 P. मृग, used in the sense of any animal.**४** A child who is made to study (कृताभ्यासः) by his parents (मातृपितृ ) becomes endowed with merits; a son does not become learned just when he comes out, or falls down, from the womb. मातृपितृ &c. मातापितृभ्यां कृतः अभ्यासः यस्य–व० गुणितां–abst. noun from गुणिन् possessive adj. from गुण. गर्भ &c. By merely coming out of the womb. This is not found in the Calcutta Edition. **५** A man's mother and father by whom he is not taught are his enemies; he does not shine in an assembly just as a crane. does not do in a multitude of swans. Hereयेन is inaccurately used for both मातृ and पितृ. It ought to have been यया sand येन. It is here made to agree with the nearest noun in gender

**  १** For example. **२** A horse, a weapon, a science, a lute, a speech, a man and a woman become fit or unfit according as they come in contact with a worthy or unworthy person. **३** What is the good of a servant who, though devoted is weak and what is the use of him who is able but obnoxious? Oh king, you should not, therefore, despise me who am, both devoted and able. **४** Through the king's disrespect, the servants become void of talent and, taking that, as an evidence, no wise man goes near him; when the kingdom is abandoned by wise men, no good policy prevails there, and when there is a failure of policy, the whole world helplessly suffers misery. मतिहीनः तृ० त०, तत्प्राधान्यात् through the ascendancy of foolish persons. बुधैस्त्यक्ते राज्ये is a Locative absolute. **५** People always honour that maṇ whom the king honours; but he who is disrespected by the king is disrespected by all, नृपार्चित तृ० त०. **६** Wise men should accept what is well said even by a child; does not the lamp shed its lustre when the sun has set? With the idea in the first line, compare बालादपि सुभाषितं ग्राह्यम्, अविषये (न. त० ) *lit.* When it is not the province of the sun, that is, in his absence.

**  १**All ministers who are prosperous are ever hard to be won over. This is the opinion (आदेशः) of great sages or seers *viz.*, prosperity injuriously affects the moral sense (Affluence is a sure domoraliser). आदेशinstruction, advice. चित्तविकारिणी (उपपद) चित्तं विकुरुते इति. Thereading सदायत्याम् &c. is not good, sinceआयति has no propriety here. **२** Appropriation of the money received, tampering with the provi- sions ( of the royal household ), easy compliance, remissness, want of capacity and addiction to pleasure, these are the defects in a minister. प्राप्तार्थ (कर्म०) स्य ग्रहणं (ष .त) द्रव्यपरी (रि) वर्तः ष. त. The roading प्राप्तार्थाग्रहणं means, not properly saving the money obtained. **३** Trying to seize the wealth pertaining to the office, always examining the king's mind (as regards himself), giving away what is agreeable and also abuse or neglect of नियोग्यार्थमहापायः the proper duty—these are the defects in ministers. The reading (नियोग्यस्य प्रभोः अर्थग्रहस्य अर्थ संचयस्य अपायः नाशः ) is better — it means ruining the wealth amassed for the lord. The words in the text do not give good sense.**४** Oh king, when pressed they give out the hidden substance in large quantities and, therefore, offfcers are generally like painful boils or wounds.

The reading of the first line is different as मुहुर्नियोगिनो बोध्याः &c. महीपतेः and means–the wealth amassed by a servant should be ascertained often and often. This is evidently better? **२** According as occasions arise. **३** Should be practised. **४** Executors of my commands; those who obey orders. **५** A king should not pardon those who disobey orders even though they be his own sons.
