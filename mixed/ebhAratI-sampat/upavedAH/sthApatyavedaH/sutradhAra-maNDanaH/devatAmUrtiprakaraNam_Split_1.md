**PREFACE**

     Indian Architecture and Sculpture, in a way, illustrate the back-ground of philosophy and religion that are still blended together in this country.  
      Sculptures and pictorial representations of our different gods are significant. For example, Yatīndramatadīpikā explains the meaning of the image of Viṣṇu (Nārāyaṇa) with his four hands bearing Śaṅkha 'conch-shell', cakra 'wheel', gadā 'club' and padma 'lotus': Śaṅkha represents ether, cakra wind, gadā fire, padma water and the image itself the earth. Thus, the figure of Nārāyaṇa represents the idea (as generally held) that he supports the creation made of the five gross elements, himself being the Supreme Spirit. The image of Naṭarāja, the 'Lord of Dancers', represents his five activities (pancakṛtya), viz., creation, preservation, destruction, giving rest and granting salvation. The deepest significance of the Divine Dance of Naṭarāja can be realized only within the heart by means of meditation. Thus, in our Architecture, so far as temples, stupas, etc., are concerned, we find the same kind of symbolism. All this gives peculiar importance to our different texts on Śilpa such as Sūtradhara Maṇḍana's works.

    The Devatāmūrtiprakaraṇam is a text on Indian Iconography and Iconometry by Sūtradhara Maṇḍana, who has to his credit, many other works on Indian Architecture and Sculpture. This work has not been published before.  
     The present text has been commented upon for the first time by the editor himself. Along with this has been published in full for the first time the text of the Rūpamaṇḍanam of the same author and treating a kindred subject. It is hoped that the understanding of the principal work will be facilitated by it. The texts have been edited from an original manuscript,

Cat. no. I. G. 89, belonging to the Asiatic Society of Bengal, Calcutta. The editor could not do more than what he did for want of adequate manuscript materials. But though the texts have been edited from a single manuscript, the editor may be said to have done his work fairly well and the learned and lucid commentary of the Devatamurtiprakaranam, which he added for the first time, to explain the text, will, it is hoped, be considered, a useful production.

     Most cordial thanks are due to Mr. Haridas Mitra, M. A., of the Visvabharati, Santiniketan, who has kindly written an Introduc tion to these works. He has discussed in it the various aspects of the history of literature on Indian Architecture and Sculpture as well as other relevant matters.

     This introduction has added to the value of the volume. An index of important words has also been appended at the end.

    We have the pleasure to express our thanks to the Secretary, Asiatic Society of Bengal, for kindly lending us the manuscript. But for this generous co-operation in the matter it would have been quite impossible for us to bring out these texts.

      We shall be failing in our duty if we do not express our heartiest thanks to Prof. Amareswar Thakur, M. A., Ph. D., Vedantashastri of the Calcutta University and formerly General Editor of the Series, who did much for the furtherance of the publication of these works.

     Finally, we may hope that the readers will excuse us for any imperfection they may notice, especially misprints that have crept in.

**INTRODUCTION**

1. SŪTRADHARA MAṆḌANA. HIS TIMES AND WORKS.

    The Devatāmūrtiprakaraṇam i. e., 'the section on the images of deities' forms a part of the Vāstu-śāstra (of Sūtradharā or Sūtravṛta-maṇḍana, the son of Śriksetra) and is a work on sculp- ture. As his title implies, Maṇḍana was an architect-Sūtradhara (literally, one who holds, plies or wields the 'plumb'-line).

    Both Mandana and his father, Śriksetra were under the patronage of Mahārāņa Kumbha, the celebrated king of Mewar- Kumbhakarna Mahendra of [Medāpaṭa.[^1] A distinguished hero, a man of letters and a noted builder of monuments, Kumbha was an outstanding personality in the history of late Mediaval India (15th C.). Mahārānā Kumbha's consort was probably Mirabai, well-known for her renunciation and deeply religious life. Kumbha (Karṇa Mahendra) wrote a commentary on the Gita- govinda of Jayadeva and it is entitled Rasikapriyā[^2] (Gita- govindațika). Two other works (on music) are also due to him:

[^1]: "“श्रमेदपाटे नृपकुम्भकर्णस्तदङ्घ्रिराजीवपरागसेवौ । महाख्यो भुवि सुधारनोदृष्टतो भूपतिबज्ञभोऽयम् ॥ ४३ ॥” अध्यायः १४ ॥वास्तुराजवल्लभः । श्रीमनस्वधारविरचितः। काशी स्वहिन्दु विश्वविद्यालयाध्यापकज्योतिषाचार्ट- पतिश्रीराम श्रीझा विरचितभाषाटी कोपेतः । विक्रम संवत् १९८१ ।"

the Saṅgīta-mīmāṃsā and the Saṅgīta rāja. He also wrote the Pathyaratnakosa.[^3]. K-(F. Kielhorn: A Catalogue of Sanskrit Mss. existing in the Central Provinces.) 96. (b). P-(F. Kielhorn: Lists of the Sanskrit manuscripts purchased for government during the years 1877-78 & 1869-78, and a list of the manus- cripts purchased from May to November 1881) 15.") Mahārāna Kumbha is said to have constructed the celebrated Tower of Victory at Chitore.[^4]

[^3]: "3. See T. Aufrecht: Catalogus Catalogorum Vol. I, p. 111 ff. (a

[^4]: "Some scholars have doubts regarding the original purpose of the structure, namely, if it was really a tower raised to commemorate a victory at all. See D. R. Bhandarkar: The Kirttistambha of Maharana Kumbha. Journal of the Indian Soc. of Oriental Art. Cal., Vol. I, 1. Regarding this magnificent structure, Fergusson says:- "

     It, therefore, stands to reason that Mahārānā Kumbhakarṇa should be a patron of architects and sculptors, just like King Bhoja of Dhārā धारानगरीपति- महाराजाधिराज श्रीभोजदेव (11th C.) who compiled the Samaraṅganasūtradhāra[^5], Baroda."), a work on architecture and 'to whom are ascribed many other important works, such as, the śrīṅgāraprakāśa (Alaṅkāra) and the Sarasavatī-kānthābharaṇa; or like Someśavaradeva, the Cālukya King (12th C.), the author (or the patron of the scholar) who compiled the encyclopaedic work-the Mānosollāsa or the Abhilaṣitārtha-cintāmaṇi.[^6]; Abhilasitarthacintamani, edited by Dr. R. Shama Sastry. MSS. 60. (1926), Mysore,")

      Maṇḍaṇa's treatise on architecture bears the titles-

     'Śilpa-Śāstra, 'Västu-sastra', and also 'Prāsāda-maṇḍana-Vāstu-śāstra.[^10]According to some scholars, it is possibly further called the 'Rajavallabha-maṇḍana' (or simply 'Rājavallabha') or the 'Sūtradhara-maṇḍana[^11]

[^11]: "II. P. K. Acharya: Op. cit., p. 102"

    In the unique library[^12] सर्वविद्यानिधान कवीन्द्राचार्य सरखतीनाम् (ग्रन्थसंग्रहस्य) वेदान्तोको वाग - वरुपीतट-बनारस") of the Sarvavidyanidhana Kavindracārya (17th C.) were stored some Mss. on art (architecture and sculpture), among which the following are worth noting- शिल्पशास्त्रप्रकरण – 2146 राजवल्लभ, 2849 वास्तुमण्डन, 2150 प्रासादमण्डन, 2151 रूपमण्डन, 2152 राजवल्लभशिल्प, 2153 वास्तुशास्त्रशिल्प. This book- lover Kavindräcärya was a Deccan Brahmin and a very learned man, the head of the Pandit community of Benares, of his time,

[^12]: "कवीन्द्राचार्यसूचीपत्रम् Kavindracharya list. Edited with Introduction by R. Anantakrishna Sastry with a Foreword by Dr. Ganganatha Jha. GOS. No. XVII, 1921. (सूची

and possessed knowledge in all departments of Sanskrit. He was rich, healthy and beautiful. After finishing studies he took to Sannyasa, thus showing his indifference to the world. On his demise his invaluable library was dispersed.

     Many of the texts by the Sūtradhara-maṇḍana had titles ending in Maṇḍana in the sense of decoration and it is not impossible, that all his works had originally such titles. On the other hand, the learned Kavīndrācārya knew the Rājāvallabha and the Rājāvallabha-śilpa to be two separate works; perhaps, the one was on Vāstu (architecture), while the other was on śilpa (sculpture).

    The Rājāvallabha-maṇḍana and some other texts by Maṇḍana, seem to have been very popular. Within two centuries, after compilation, we find copies of his texts deposited in the invaluable library of Kavīndrācārya From Mewar, the works of Mandana found their way to Benares, the great nerve-centre (Marma-sthāna) of Indian culture.

    From Benares, Mandana's works probably spread to other places westwards[^13]as well as eastwards.[^14] Mss. of his works are also met with in the South,[^15] where they might have been easily carried from the Central India. Thus it is evident that Mandana's handbooks on architecture and sculpture, enjoyed considerable popularity with artists and craftsmen.

[^13]: "Apparently one of Mandana's works as published with diagrams by Bharati at Baroda, 1891, see P. K. Acharya: Op. cit., p. 103."

[^14]: "The Rajavallabha-mandana was published by Raja Rādhākānta Deva in his Encyclopaedic Dictionary, शब्दकल्पद्रुमSabda-kalpa-druma. See under Silpa-sastram शिल्पशास्त्रम्"

[^15]: "Copious extracts from the Rupa-mandana have been made in TAGoninatha Rao: Elements of Hindu Iconography. Madras."

2. SOURCES OF THE

DEVATĀMŪRTI-PRAKARAṆAM.  

         For compiling his DmP. Sutradhara Mandana seems either to have chiefly utili sed the South Indian texts, or to have actually based his work on them.

        Indeed his DmP. is more S. Indian than N. Indian in character. This would at once show that, most probably, the art of temple-architecture was already slowly dying in the North India, while in the South it lived with virility.

       Naturally, for preparing his DmP. Maaṇḍana turned chiefly to South Indian sources. Another striking peculiarity is that he never utilised, as far as is evident, the Tamil Śaiva or Vaiṣṇava Agamas. But he made copious use of the Śilparatnam[^16]and the Mayamatam[^17] both probably from original Malayalam sources.

[^16]: "Silparatnam of Śrikumāra. Part I. Edited by Mm. T. Ganapati Sastri, 1922; Ditto. Part II. Edited by K. Sambasiva Sastrī, 1929."

[^17]: " Mayamatam of Mayamuni. Edited by Mm. T. Ganapati Sastri, 1919."

      For some reasons, not evident, the S. Indian Agamas were not accessible to Maṇḍana. Either Skt. texts in the Tamil script, often with copious glosses in vernacular, we re not intelligible to Mandana; or the lines of communication between Rajputana and the Tamil lands were beset with obstacles. The latter eventuality is all the more plausible, when we take into account, the unsettled political conditions of the times.

     Repeated invasions and onslaughts of the fierce Turks and Mongols interrupted the normal course of events in Northern, Eastern and Central India. And, the warriors' swords were more in requisition then than the painters' brushes or the stone-masons' lines and pellets.

    

 Among the Northern Texts, Mandana seems certainly to have utilised the Viiṣṇudharmattaram[^18] p. 580. Śrivisnudharmottaram, or, Visnudharmottara-mahāpuruṇam was edited by Panditas Madhusudana and Madhavaprasada Sarmans from a ms., obtained by Mm. Sudhakara Dvivedin and published (from brivenkatesvara Press, Bombay) in Sumvat 1969, 1834 Saka (A. C. 1911-12). See for Transl. of chapters 2, 27, 35-43, Dr. Stella Kramrisch: The Visnudharmottaram (Part III), A Treatise on Indian Painting. Journal of Letters, Vol. XI. (Univ. Cal, 1924), and The Calculla Review, Feb., 1924, P. 331 ff. A. K. Coomaraswamy: Visnudharmottara (III), 41. JAOS., LII., 1932; Ditto. Transl. Visnudharmottara.

Appendix II, Note 2."), in the first instance. This is, traditionally, said to be a part of the Garuḍa- Puraṇa- more properly the uttara-bhāga of the Garuḍa- Puraṇam[^19] 480. 188a. See Burnell: Classified Index of Skt. Mss. in the palace at Tanjore."). According to another opinion[^20], VP. belongs to the second part of the Viṣṇu-puraṇam.

[^18]: "M. Winternitz: A History of Indian Literature. Vol I. (Cal. univ., 1927

[^19]: "M. Winternitz: Geschichte der indischen Literatur, Band I, (German Ed.

[^20]: "See Introduction in Skt. to the Ed. of Text, Srivenkatesvara Pr."

      "The Viṣṇudharmottara is occasionally given out as a part of a Purana, namely the Garuḍa- Puraṇa, but generally it is counted an independent Upa-Puraṇa. It is repeatedly quoted by Alberuni as the 'Viiṣṇudharma'. It is a Kashmiri Vaiṣṇava book of ency- clopoædic character in three sections. Section I deals with the usual themes of the PuraṇasSection II deals with law and politics, as well as with medicine, the science of war, astronomy and astrology. There is in it a prose section... Paitāmaha-Siddhānta' as this is an extract from the Brahamā-sphuṭa-siddhānta written by

Brahmagupta in 628 A. D., the Viṣṇudharmottara must have been compiled between 628 and 1000 A. D. Sect. III, too, is of a very miscellaneous character, treating of dancing, singing and music, sculpture and painting (the making of images of gods) and architecture (construction of temples)."

      The Matsya-Puraṇa, the Padma-Puraṇa, the Skanda- Puraṇa and the Brahma-Puraṇa were also used for the (Śiva) Linga and (Viṣṇu) Śālagrāma sections; and passages from the Bṛhat-Saṃhitā, have been quoted verbatim, in the Adbhuta section.

       Another text, more sparingly consulted, is the Viśvakarma-śāstra. This is certainly a Silpa work of the Northern School[^21].

[^21]: "Haridas Mitra: Buddhapratimulakṣaṇam. The Sarasvati Bhavana Skt. Series, Benares; No. 48. Introduction p. 3. Also, see Note 27. Supra"

       But the work most profusely drawn upon, often verbatim, is certainly the[Rūpa maṇḍana](http://# "T. A. Gopinatha Rao: Elements of Hindu Iconography. Vol. I. Part II."). This may be identical with the text of the same name[^22], the authorship of which is ascribed to Maṇḍana himself.

[^22]: " See Section 1. Supra."

ON THE CANONS OF INDIAN ART.

The Matsya-Puraṇa[^23] enumerates the names of eighteen (वास्तुशास्त्रोपदेशक) Vāstuśāstropadeśakas or Masters[^24] of the Sciences of Architecture, Sculpture and Painting, as follows :-

[^23]: "Matsya-Purina. Anandāsran Ed., 1907. Chapter 252."

Another account given in the Viśvakarma-prakāśa[^26], and preserved in many versions is evidently a compilation of a later date :-  
इति प्रोक्तं वास्तुशास्त्रं पूर्वे गर्गाय धीमते ।

[^26]: "Sri-Vivakarmaprakasa, with Bharalika-printed from the tri-ve.kate vara Press, Bombay; also lithographed from Siddha-Vinayaka Yantra, Eenares. See, also Notes 41, 42 post.."

Among the Brahmanic masters of Vastu and śilpa-śāstras, the names of Viśvakarman and Maya are mentioned very often.

    The Viṣṇu dharmattaram[^27] gives the traditional mythical origin of the art of painting, and its canons, (i. e., Citrasutram):-how the sage Nārāyaṇa first painted on earth with the juice of mango leaf the figure of a superbly beautiful damsel, and for humiliating the heavenly apsarasas he invested her with life. Brought into being, on arvi, (earth) she was called urvaśī (earth-born). The great sage having thus created the art of painting (Citra), taught Viśvakarman its canons.

[^27]: "Sri-Vis udharmottaram. Part III, chap. 35."

    The Citralakṣaṇam[^28] of Nagnajit mentions Viśvakarman, Prahlāda and Nagnajit, among the masters of painting, after the adoration of gods and goddesses (namaskāra), and the benediction

(āśīrvacanam), the definition of the subject-matter (vastu-nirdeśa) etc., in the regular Kārya style.

   An attempt may be made to render these important passages back into rhythmic Sanskrit, from the German translations in Dr. B. Laufer's admirable edition of the text-the original version of which is probably lost, though a Tibetan translation of it has fortunately been preserved.[^29]

[^29]: "These conjectural reconstructions unsatisfactory though, they might be of interest to those to whom the German and Tibetan editions are inaccessible or not sufficiently intelligible."

The Matsya-puranam, the Agni-puraṇam, the Viśvakarmā-prakāśa and the Bṛhat-saṃhitā, probably have handed down the northern tradition of their times.

The list in the Agni-puraṇam as well as in the Manasara is confusing and apparently corrupt. There are linguistic and other difficulties in the readings of the Agni-puraṇam list[^31] twenty- five names, after all.") of 25 authorities; on the other hand, all these are said to be Pancaratra and Saptaratra works-probably both classes were Vaiṣṇava, if the latter school at all existed.

     The Tibetan text, dpag bsam ljon bzans[^33] of Lama Sum-pa mk'an-po ye-śes dpal-abyor (1702-1775), traces the origin of the art of painting to Nagnajit :-how he painted the figure of a dead Brahmin child and how the god, Brahman invested it with life. Later on the art of painting was propagated through Viśvakarman, and Ṛṣī Ātreya who discovered calligraphy.

Regarding the Śilpa Sastras, Rám Ráz says[^52] :-

[^52]: "Rám Ráz: Essay on the Architecture of the Hindus, London, M. DCCC. XXXIV."

    " It is true that the Hindus were in possession of numerous treatises on architecture, sculpture, & c., which collectively are called the śilpa śāstra, but unfortunately few traces of them remain. There appears to have been, according to some, thirty-two, and according to others sixty-four, standard treatises on the above- mentioned arts.........

     In a series of memorial verses preserved among the artists, are recorded the names of the authors or titles of the above men- tioned sixty-four treatises. Of these, thirty-two are called Muc'hya, or principal, and thirty-two Upa or subordinate.

They (verses) contain little more than titles mostly patronymics of the deities who revealed the particular art or

temperaments. But like unto the rivers, which take direct routes or run along circuitous courses, and yet, ultimately, find their ways and merge into the sea even, like unto that, indeed, O! my Lord, you alone are the sole Refuge of the human beings.

    These three most important references to the ancient Masters-- Bhagavan Ganapati, Bhima and Kayapa the first two references being especially striking, are to be found in Prasthana Thraya Madhusudana Saraswati Smriti. Reproduced by Pandit T. Subraya Sastri of Bangalore. Transl. into Eng. by the Late Ratanlal M. Mody and G. Venkatachala Sarma of Bangalore. V. B. Soobbiah & Sons. Bangalore, 1931.

      Though there are some anachronisms in the edition, as regards Sri Madhusudana's date etc., there are the strongest grounds to suppose that the learned Pandita's wonderful edition is absolutely genuine. As, many of the Texts, mentioned are actually traceable and one, even, published by the same-viz. the Amu-bodhini of Bharadvaja Ṛsi with Comm.

     As regards the time etc. of Sri Madhusudana Sarasvati, a few words would be not out-of-place. He flourished before Śri Caitanyadeva, in Bengal and was the author of several works of great erudition, among which are Bhaktirasayanam (Ed. Acyutagranthamala, Benares) and Advaitasiddhi (Ed.

The Kamikagama, for instance, devotes sixty chapters out of a total of seventy-five to architecture and sculpture, and its treatment of the subjects can hardly be surpassed by that of an avowedly architectural treatise".

     "The Karanugama also devotes much space to architecture and sculp- ture. There are thirty-seven chapters in the Agama, which deal with these subjects exhaustively. It makes a distinct addition to the Agamas' contribu- tions to the Silpa-sastras. It contributes two valuable chapters dealing with the details of the nine and ten tāla measures. This is also a highly techni- cal matter concerning sculpture and entirely missing in the Puranas".

      "The Suprabhedugama has devoted only fifteen chapters to architecture and sculpture. Nor has it anything new to add to the Agamas' contribu- tions to the Silpa-bastras. But its unique nature consists in the fact that it has quite successfully summarised all important matters in a comparatively small space, and in respect of brevity, explicitness and precision it surpasses even the Brhat-samhita of Varahamihira."

      "The Vaikhānasagama has two chapters on sculpture, one of which deals with the general description of images and the other with the ten tula measures. The Amsumad-bhedagama has a single chapter on the ten tala measures."

      We owe it entirely to (the religious zeal of) the Buddhists, the conservation, for posterity, of some Silpa Texts-both Buddhistic and Brahmanical, and perhaps, even Jaina-a few of which are entirely lost in Sanskrit. Wonderfully accurate translations of the Sanskrit versions, for example, of the Works of Atreya and of Nagnajit, are preserved in the encyclopaedic Tibetan compilation Bstan-hgyur.[^54] Dr. Berthold Laufer had brought out a critical edition of the Tibetan version of Citralakṣaṇam[^55]ascribed to Nagnajit.

      Of special importance are some of the original Sanskrit texts, procured from Nepal, mainly through the initiative of the present writer.

    Besides these, a few Śilpa Texts of purely Buddhistic nature, are preserved, in Ceylon. They are in corrupt Sanskrit surely probably Post-Buddhistic. The most important among them, is the Sāriputra[^57] ascribed to Sāriputra, a direct disciple of the Blessed One.

[^57]: "Through the kind help of Bhadanta Mañjuri, very obliging Buddhist Monk who is well grounded in Pali and Sanskrit, I was ableto prepare for my personal use a Nagari transcription of this important Text and its Ceylonese Commentary. This learned monk has also undertaken to transcribe in Nagari, for my use, the two remaining chapters of the Sariputra, as also the Rupivali. I am preparing to publish critical editions of these important Texts of Buddhistic Art in near future."

     The Buddha-pratima-laksanam is preserved also in a Chinese version.[^58] We thus have three versions of this Śilpa text- the original Sanskrit, the Tibetan and the Chinese Translations, for comparison.

[^58]: "See Haridas Mitra: Op. cit., Appendix: Tsao-siang-tou-leang- king."

     But the Jainas preceded the Buddhists in the adoption of an iconolatrous cult. Very probably, the artistic study, for representation, of the undraped human body, originated with the Nirgrantha and the Ājirika ascetics, who went about naked and had daily chances for observing the natural bodily forms, in course of their ascetic practices[^59]eru.")Indeed, the Jainas contributed, from early times, very considerably to the develop- ment of the plastic and the graphic arts of India[^60] Indian Iconometry, in course of publication.").  
      Though the Buddhists as well as the Jainas have made important contributions to art the Brahmanic art traditions-as contained in the Śilpaśāstras, are perhaps much earlier.

   The two most important treatises of Sulvasutras are those of Baudhayana and Āpastamba. Two smaller treatises of later dates, are the Mānava and the Māitrayaṅiya Śulva-sūtras. There is also a Kātyāyana Śulva Pariśiṣṭa, belonging to theŚukla-Yajuṣa[^62]. P. 277.").

in these cases it can be proved that these works are indeed so interconnected that, to a certain extent, they can be regarded as the four volumes of a uniform work. It is possible that Baudhayana and Apastamba were actually the authors of complete Kalpasitras comprising all the four kinds of texts. But even if they were not the actual authors, at all events, the Srauta, Grhya, Dharma and Sulvasutras of Baudhayana and Apastamba schools are works composed on a uniform plan, of these two schools of the Yajurveda....

P. 271. "Ritual (Kalpa), which constitutes the chief contents of the Brahmanas, is...the first Vedänga to receive systematic treatment in special manuals, the so-called Kalpasutras.

     Indeed, the beginnings of the Vāstu-sāstras and the Śilpa-śāstras are to be traceable to the Vedangie Jyantisa, (Kalpa)Śulva-sūtra[^63] on the one hand, and to the Tantrika ritualistic Yantras and Maṇḍalas[^64] etc., on the other.

CHAPTER III  
THE CANONS OF INDIAN ART (Contd.)

   While, it is not necessary to make anything more than only passing reference to the Vedic, the Epic (Itihāsa) and the Classical Sanskrit and the Buddhist literatures etc., on subjects like architecture, art etc., these being dealt with, at great lengths by more competent scholars, elsewhere, the Paranas in this connexion call for special notice.[^78]

[^78]: "For General information in full, regarding the Puranas, see :-M. Winternitz: A. History of Ind. Lit. Vol. I. Section II; especially, PP. 517-586. About the Silpa sections of the Puranas, see:- P. K. Acharya Ind. Arch. I. General Survey. III. The Epics. V. The Age of Manasura; and also A Dictionary of Hindu Archit. Appendix II.; N. Law: Varta-the Hindu Economics, Ind. Antiq., Vol. XLVII."

     Of the eighteen or nineteen Mahā-purāṇas, besides the other Upa-purāṇas[^79], chapt. XV.-ff. Puranas; and see, especially about eighteen Puranas, pp. 513-14 and about eighteen Upa- Puranas, p. 521. Also, M. Winternitz: Op. cit., p. 532-33- "), some nine have special reference to architecture and sculpture etc. Most of the Purāṇas are Vaiṣṇava and as many as fourteen of them are devoted to the worship of Viṣṇu; but they deal with the images of all the three deities, Trimūrti, forming the Triad.  
    1. The Agni-purāṇa has sixteen chapters on Vāstu and śilpa -one of them on town-planning, two on residential buildings and thirteen on sculpture.  
    2. The Garuḍa-purāṇa has two chapters on architecture and two on sculpture.  
    3. The Nāradiya-purāṇa treats only the construction of temples, reservoirs, wells and tanks in its one chapter.  
    4.The Brahmāṇḍa-purana, likewise, treats the construc- tion of temples and other buildings in its one chapter.  
    5. The Bhaviṣya-purāṇa has four chapters, three being devoted to sculpture and one on the architecture of temples.  
  6. The Matsya-purāṇa has eight comprehensive chapters dealing in great detail with architecture and sculpture, constituting

[^79]: "For full lists of the Puranas and the Upa-Puranas: see M. Monier- Williams Indian Wisdom (1893, Lond

the Vāstu-prakaraṇa i. e., the section on Architecture. In one of these chapters, accounts are given of the eighteen Vāstu- sāstropadeśakas, ancient masters of architecture. One chapter is devoted to columns, two to buildings, one to building-materials. Three chapters are exclusively devoted to sculpture-one being on Tālamāna, iconometry and two others on the Phallus.

    7. The Linga-purāṇa has a single chapter on sacrificial pits, temples and the installation of deities.  
  8. The Vāyu-purāṇa has a single chapter about building temples on mountains.  
  9.The Skanda-purāṇa has three chapters on Vāstu and śilpa. One chapter describes how for his daughter's marriage Himālaya had a pavillion constructed by Viśvakarman under the instruction of his Purohita Gārgacārya and how clever portraits or life-like representations of all gods were made there in, and they struck even the gods themselves with awe and wonder. Another chapter describes the laying out by Viśvakarman himself, of a large city Mahīnagara. From another chapter, we come to know how a golden hall was made by Padmanidhi, at the command of Indradyumna, how Viśvakarman made three chariots at the command of Narada and how their installation ceremony was performed by this ṛṣi.

   For informations regarding Vāstu, śilpa and Citra- the most important Paurāṇiksources are the Agni, the Matsya and the Viṣṇudharmottaram.  
   "The Matsya or Matsya-Purāṇa[^80] Vol. 17. See M. Winternitz: A Hist. of Ind. Lit. Vol. I, pp. 575-76.")... is one of the older works of the Purāņa literature, or at least one of those which have preserved most of the ancient text, and do fair justice to the definition of a purāṇa.' It commences with the story of the great flood out of which Viṣṇu, in the form of a fish (Matsya) saves only Manu. While the ship in which Manu is sailing

[^80]: "The Matsya-Purana is published in Anandäśram Sanskrit Series No. 54 and transl. into Engl., in SBH. (Panini office, Allahabad

along is being drawn through the flood by the fish, there takes place between him and Viṣṇu, incarnated as a fish, a conversation which forms the substance of the Purana. Creation is treated in detail, then follow the genealogies. Neither are the usual geographical, astronomical and chronological sections absent, and according to V. A. Smith....the lists of kings in this Purāņa are particularly reliable for the Andhra dynasty. It has very much in common with the Mahabharata and the Harivamsa and there is often literal agreement. There are, however, very numerous later additions and interpolations. For instance,ceremonies at the building of a house (chapts. 252-257), the erection and dedication of statues of deities, temples and palaces (chapts. 258-270)...etc.

    "As far as the religious content is concerned, the Matsya- Purāņa might be called Śivaite with just as much reason as it is classed as Vişnuite. Religious festivals of the Vaiṣṇavas are described side by side with those of the śaivas, and both Viṣṇu and Śiva legends are related. In chapter 13 Devi ("the Goddess", Śiva's wife Gauri) enumerates to Dakṣa the one hundred and eight names by which she wishes to be glorified. It is obvious that both sects used the work as a sacred book.[^171]"

[^171]: #

    "The Āgneya or Agni-purāṇa[^81] and Anandāśram Skt. Series, No. 41; Transl. by M. N. Dutt (Cal., 1901)."),is so called because it is supposed to have been communicated to Vaiśiṣṭha by Agni, It describes the incarnations (Avatāras) of Viṣṇu, among them also those as Rāma and Kṛṣṇā, where it confessedly follows the Rāmāyaṇa, Māhabhārata and Harivaṃśa. Although it commences with Viṣṇu,it is yet essentially a śivaite work and deals in detail with the mystic cult of the Liṇga and of Durgā. It also mentions Tāntric rites, gives instructions for the production of images of gods and their consecration and refers to the cult of Gaṇeśa (chapt.71) and the sun-cult (chapt. 73). But the cosmo- logical, geneological and geographical sections peculiar to the Puranas are not missing. The especially distinctive feature of this Purāṇa is, however, its encyclopedic characters. It actually deals with anything and everything. We find sections on Geography, Astronomy and Astrology, on omina and potenta, house building and other occupations of daily life....To which age this remarkable encyclopædia or its separate parts belong, it is impossible to say."

     The Matsya-Purāṇa enumerates the names of eighteen ancient teachers of architecture, as quoted before. The passages have been interpreted as below.[^82] Appendix X, by Sris Chandra Vidyarnava, p. cvi.")  
         "The Ṛṣis asked:-  
     'Sūta ! be gracious enough to tell us how royal palaces and other houses are constructed. Also explain to us what is Vāstu- Deva-1.'  
       Sūta replied:-(1) Bhṛgu, (2) Atri, (3) Vaiśiṣṭha , (4) Viśva- karmā, (5) Maya, (6) Nārada, (7) Nagnajit, (8) Viśālākṣa, (9) Indra, (10) Brahmā, (11) Svāmikārtika, (12) Nandiśvara, (13) śaunaka, (14) Garga, (15) śri Kṛṣṇa, (16) Aniruddha,

      Which I will now relate to you."

      The Agni-Purāṇa[^83] list of twenty-five authoritative texts, quoted before is interpreted thus:-

[^83]: " Agni-Puranam, Engl. prose transl, by Manmathanath Dutt. Cal., 1903. Chapter XXXIX. In the Introduction Mr. Datta writes:- "

      "Hayagriva said:-O, Brahman, hear me speak about the consecration of the images of Vishnu and other gods-(1).

     I have already dealt with the principles of Pancharātras[^172] and Saptarātra schools of philosophies which are classed by the Munis under twenty-five different heads as discussed in the following books or Tantras, viz.:

[^172]: #

    (1) The Hayacirsa Tantram, which is the first and original book of the Pancharatra School, (2) the Trailokya Mohan Tantram, (3) the Baibhabum Tantram, (4) the Pouskaram Tantram, (5) the Prahlad Tantram, (6) the Garga, (7) the Galabum, (8) the Naradiya Tautram, (9) the Sampraenum Tantram, (10) the Sandilya Tantram, (11) the Vaishvakam, (12) the Svatatum, (13) the Shounakum Tantram, (14) the Vashistam, (15) the Gayansagar Tantram, (16) the Shaimbhubam, (17) the Kapil Tantram, (18) the Tarksa Tantram, (19) the Narayanikum, (20) the Atrayaum, (21) the Narasinha Tantram, (22) the Anandaksa, (23) the Arun Tantram, (24) the Boudhayan Tantram, (25) the Arsam or the Bicvoktam tantram which is a synopsis of the preceding one-(2)."

     Inspite of the many imperfections that have crept in through ages, and the ignorant mis-interpretation resulting apparently

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

      It may be safely asserted here that Vaisnavism owes its origin to this school of philosophy, which, with the aid of several subsequent accretions of an article of faith or practice from the sister schools, has determined the nature and formation of its namesake in modern times. Śankarācārya once questioned the soundness and orthodoxy of the tenets of Pañcaratra School, and even attempted to prove their incompatibility with the principles of the Vedas.  
     (Vide Śariraka-Bhāsya,-2-2-43, 2-2-44 and 2-4-25).  
     Rāmanuja, however, held a contrary view and quoted slokas from the Mahābhārata and other tantras to show that not only the Pañcaratra School embodies within itself the highest principles of Indian Spiritualism, but that it is quite in harmony with the revelations of the Vedas like the Sānkhya Philosophy which too was denounced by Śaṅkara on account of its heterodoxy :-

सांख्यं योगः पञ्चरात्रंवेदाः पाशुपतं तथा।  
किमेतान्येकनिष्ठानि पृथानि वा मुने॥  
एवमेकं सांख्य वेद (?) वेदारण्यकमेव वा।  
परस्परातानि पञ्चराचन्तु कथ्यते॥  
सांख्यं योगः पञ्चरात्रंवेदाः पाशुपतं तथा।  
आत्मप्रमाणीतानि न हन्तव्यानि हेतुभिः॥

from loss of traditions in North India, the Āgneya list of the Pāncaratra Āgamas is conclusively proved to be authentic.  

      "Now, in the case of the Pañcarātra, tradition mentions one hundred and eight Saṃhitās, and in a few, texts about this number are actually enumerated. Such lists, coquetting with the sacred number 108, are, of course, open to suspicion."  
     "The fact, however, that none of the available lists of Saṃhitās, including those which pretend to give 108 names, actually conforms to this number but all of them enumerate either more names or less, is one thing telling in their favour; and when, as is the case, it can further be shown that a respectable number of the texts enumerated are still available, while not a few of the others are found to be quoted or summarised in the later literature, and that a number of Saṃhitās which are not included in any of the lists, are either extant or quoted-then the value of the latter can no longer be denied. We have, consequently, collated those lists, four in all, and with them a fifth list found in the Agni- Pūrāṇa, and as a result offer the table in which all the names... have been arranged in alphabetical order."  
   "The Kapiñjala list comprises 106 names, the list of Pādma Tantra 112, that of Viṣṇu Tantra 141, that of Haya- Śirsa Saṃhitā..34, and that found in the 39th adhyāya of Agni (Āgneya)-Purāṇa only 25.

    A still shorter list, namely that of the apocryphal Nāradiya, has not been taken into account."

    The literature of the Pañcarātras, like other sectarian literatures, falls into two broad divisions comprising respectively of works of inspired or divine origin and of human authorship The latter class, treats chiefly what are called vidhi and prayoga and consists of digests, commentaries, extracts and studies on special subjects, and the like. The former class, consists of the Saṃhitās or "compositions" (compendia), that is, metrical works

dealing, with a number of topics, if not the whole, of the Pañca- rātra system.[^84]  
     "of the principal subjects treated in the Pañcarātra, the scientific student will probably find it best to distinguish the following ten :-  
     (1) Philosophy;  
     (2) Linguistic occultism (mantra-śāstra);  
     (3) Theory of magical figures (yantra-śāstra);  
    (4) Practical magic (māyā-yoga);  
     (5) Yoga;  
     (6) Temple-building (mandira-nirmāṅa);  
    (7) Image-making (pratiṣṭha-ridhi);  
     (8) Domestic observances (saṃskāra, āhnika);  
    (9) Social rules (varṇāśrama-dharma);  
     (10) Public festivals (itsava)"[^85]  
   An examination of the principal subjects, treated in the Pañca- ratras, will easily show the close relationship of many of these, with the Vastu and the śilpa-śāstras.

[^84]: "Otto Schrader, Op. cit. pp, 2-3 ff."

[^85]: "Ibid. p. 26."

   In the evolution and the development of the Building, the Plastic and the Graphic Arts of India, the Velānga Jyotiṣa and the Kalpa (Śulva) Sūtras, the Saica Agamas and the Sākta Tantrās, the Purāṇas and the Pancaratras, etc., have, among the Brāhmanic Texts, made similar contributions.

    Even the Jainas and the Buddhists, did not lag far behind. It will, however, be out of place to make any discussion of the latter sources, here.

CHAPTER IV

THE PRESENT EDITION

    The preparation of critical Editions of the Sanskrit Texts on śilpa (or, Tantra) is beset with many difficulties some of which are of a very serious character.

      The language is, on the one hand, obscure and full of techni- calities; extraneous aids-in the shapes of explanatory comments and notes which are fortunately so abundant in the cases of other branches of Indian Literature are sadly wanting in the cases of the Silpa (and the Tāntrik) Texts. On the other hand, the Manuscripts of these branches of Sanskrit, are mostly corrupt or in mutilated state, due, not only to the loss of art traditions but also among other reasons, to the indifference of the hereditary craftsmen[^86], for the Daulatpur Hindu Academy, জাতিমালা। (?) অর্থাত্ পদ্মপুরাণ ও বহুবিধ পুরাণ শাস্ত্র হইতে সংগৃহীত। শ্রী মহেশচন্দ্র (sic!) বিদ্য়ারত্ন কর্ত্তৃক অনুবাদিত। হরিহর যন্ত্র । চিত্পুর রোড। বটতলা। সন ১২৭৪ সাল, ৩২ আষাঢ। Reprinted. বেঙ্গল রায় প্রেস। সন ১৩৩০ সাল। জাতিকৌমুদি ও জাতিসঙ্কর। শ্রীবেণীমাধব ন্য়ায়রত্ন কত্তৃক সঙ্কলিত। কৃমুদ্বন্ধ যন্ত্র। সন ১৯২৩ সাল, ফাল্গুন।") and artists themselves to the literary works on the subject.

[^86]: "Compare Brahma-vaivarta Puranam, Brahma Khanda. Adh. 10, Jatimāla. (From a MS., collected by the late Prof. Satishchandra Mitra

      There, however, prevails an unfortunate and regrettable attitude of mind which looks down upon these hereditary craftsmen and artists who have carried on with love and veneration even when there were no encouragements, the sacred duty of keeping up for generations, the flames of Indian artistic tradition alive. The Brahmanic theologians have cast down the artists and the craftsmens. The Nītiśāstra-kāras have enumerated

the musicians along with the cut-throats, charlatans rascals.[^87]

[^87]: "For example, see the rare old Niti-sastra, Caksusīyaman, fragments of which have been traced and published for the first time-A. S. Ramanath Ayyar Chaksusiyam-an Arthasastra. JBORS Vol. XI, pp. 81-84."

    And yet the Śilpa, the Saṅgīta and the Nātya etc., which have all reputed Ṛṣis of hoary antiquity, as their founders, owed their birth to divine inspiration. We have, therefore, here, another set of apparent paradoxes of Indian culture, which should provoke serious enquiry.

  Very elaborate descriptions are given of the merits (Phala- śruti and Artha-vāda) for raising pious foundations, or erecting sacred structures such as the dedication of an image that would accrue on the part of the donor, (danapati).[^88] Arts of music and

[^88]: "तथा हि- श्रीगोपालभट्टकृते 'श्रीहरिभक्तिविजा से - १८ विलास - श्रीमूयविर्भावमाहात्म 'विष्णुधर्मोत्तरे। देवस्य प्रतिमायान्तु यावन्तः परमाणवः; सावर्षसहस्राणि विश्वलोके महीयते । ' तथा - 'श्री हरि०- १८ विलास --- श्रीमूर्ति प्रतिष्ठामाहाको 'मामा' । प्रतिष्ठायाः सुराणां च देवतार्यानुकीर्त्तनात् । देवयज्ञोवार्खापि बन्धनेन विमुच्यते ॥ तथा- संङ्घाभाषित प्रतिमा लक्षण-विवरण्याम्' यावन्तः परमाणवो भगवतस्तूयेषु विम्वेषु वा। तत्कर्त्तुर्दिवि भूतले च नियतं तावन्ति॥ --संपदोऽखिला भुक्ता च सर्वं सुखम्। प्रान्ते जन्मजराविपत्तिरहितं प्राप्नोति वौद्धं पदम्॥"

dancing have similarly been glorified[^89], [Natyaprasamsa], l. 7b-11a (and Engl. Transl.). For the Sangita-sastra etc., also, it is possible to give numerous examples, of such eulogy.") although the artists and craftsmen themselves, curiously enough, occupy only degraded positions in society.

[^89]: "Compare Nandikeśvara's Abhinayadarpanam (Critical Ed. of the Text with Introd., Transl., Notes and Illustrations. By Manomohan Ghosh., Cal. Skt. Series, No. V.

      Thus the preservation of Śilpa Texts in the hands of the hereditary artists and craftsmen who were looked down upon, was beset with some difficulty. But mistakes and lapses in the Mss. are fortunately seldom, errors of commission, and not a few, may be due to inexpert scribes. Unless and until better readings, supported by substantial grounds, can be suggested, it is not allowable to reject altogether the only available texts which bear the stamp of tradition through a long succession of generations. It is, therefore, very necessary to sift very thoroughly the apparently corrupt and contradictory readings with the entire critical apparatus at our disposal.[^90]. Out of a hopeless medley and confused jumble of data, careful scrutiny and repeated efforts enabled the present writer, to deduce a number of most important principles.")

[^90]: "It would not be, out of place, to compare here, for example, the immense help, which the present writer derived, by subjecting the apparently confusing readings to Epigraphic and Palaeographic Tests, elsewhere, while preparing his edition of the important Silpa Text: The Buddhapratima-lakṣaṇam. The Sarasvati Bhavana Sanskrit Texts, No. 48. (Benares, 1933

     And when there is a great paucity of materials in the form of Mss., as is the case with the present text Devatā-mūrti-prakaraṇam, it is necessary to formulate some general laws, or, to deduce some principles for future guidance, in preparing a critical edition. Secondly, it is also very urgent to devise ways and means, for interpreting the texts of Silpa, when all extraneous aids are so inaccessible.

      In close analogy to the rules of interpretations, the Pari- bhāshās of Vyākaraṇa and Mīmāṃsā śāstras, we must formulate some rules, for these śilpa Texts, too.

          As the (Śilpa) Vāstu śāstras are technical and obscure in language, no violent corrections or half-hazard emendations of texts are warrantable. Similar is the case with the Tantrik and Kindred Texts.  
Some of the first rules, that should be made, may be as follows:-

     (a) Not a single syllable should be ommited or even a half, in the (Śilpa) Vāstu and the Tāntrik Texts.

मात्रालाघवो नाऽनुमन्तव्यो वास्तु-शिल्प तन्त्रशास्त्रादिषु।

    (b) As in the Mimāmsa śāstra, we should try to account for and harmonise any apparent contradictions. When some of the texts are really contradictory, they may be considered to be due to differences in recensions, sections or topics.

सति भिन्नवाक्यत्वे शाखाभेदः प्रकरणभेदो विषयभेदो वाऽवगन्तव्यः ।

    (c) Corrections should be reduced to the minimum e. g., like addition of an Akṣara, as a-kara or anusrāra.

स्तोकमात्रा संशुद्धिः । योगोऽकाराऽनुस्वारादीणाम् ।

    (d) For determining the correct readings not only the metrical and the grammatical considerations should be regarded as important but also the Epigraphic data are equally valuable.

पाठनिर्णये छन्दोव्याकरणवत् प्रामाण्यं लिपिशास्त्रस्य ।

     Besides these four main principles, other important ones might suggest themselves or be evolved.

   Now, we must turn back to the important question of the interpretation of texts. As has been stated before, there is a great paucity of aids to explanation. Commentaries, notes, so far as both the (śilpa) Vāstu and the Tantra śastras are concerned, are

very few. Yet these subjects are of so great importance, that some methods must be found out for the correct understanding of these texts.

     Speaking from personal experience, the present writer can confidently recommend two very certain methods.

**      I**. The first method is to compare Texts kindred, or, parallel and to compare, them again and again.

    By kinship, must be understood similarity as regards essence and spirit, and proximity in point of time and place. For there can be no real comparisons between subjects which have no points of similarity e. g., between a donkey and a mush-room. Sadraya, similarity, in the most rigorous technical sense, is defined as follows:--[^91] S. V. सादृश्यम.")

[^91]: " See Annambhatta's Tarkasamgraha: See Mm. Bhimācārya Jhalakikar: Nyayakosa (Bombay Skt. Series

तद्भिन्नत्वे सति तद्गतभूयोधर्मवत्त्वं सादृश्यम् ।

     Two objects, though they be different, if they have a sufficient number of common characteristics, might be regarded as Similar. The essence of similarity, Sasya is this common characteristic Sāmānya dharma.

   Some notable examples of objects with such common features are the Abhinaya-hastas, the Natya-hastas or Karaṇas, the Śilpa-hastas and the Tāntrika Mudrās, which may be compared with one another. But it would be useless waste of time and energy to try to compare heterogeneous objects and such comparisons will be impossible when kinship etc., are lacking.

   II. The second important method of interpretation of obscure passages is to trace these back, if possible, to the Source Books. Especially, when we have to do with compilations, (as is the case, with the present work, the Devatāmurti-prakaraṇa) which are based entirely on earlier texts, this method is very effective; and it is at once corroborative and corrective; for all citations can be thus checked at once and with absolute certainty.

    By tracing back to their sources, at least about half of the entire text of the Devatāmurti-prakaraṇa could be thus dealt with. The limited time at the disposal of the present writer has unfortunately rendered it impossible to trace and to locate every passage with equal success, though such an eventuality may not be impossible.

    Once for all, our lines of action have been determined, and the ways and means devised, we can proceed with greater hopes of success, in preparing the critical edition of the Devatāmurti-prakaraṇa. Though rigorous adherence to these above principles for guidance, and the methods of interpretation, may have drawbacks, conjectures and assumptions without sufficient data will be reduced to minimum. Moreover, imagination has little scope for any outlet in the specialised branches of study. The Muses of archaeology and history are too old to mount the Pegasus.

   With these preliminary remarks, it would now be possible, to discuss the readings of the Devatāmurti-prakaraṇa The passages within inverted commas are due to the present writer.

The last two (8, 121-122) verses contain the author's apology for preparing the compilation, and the final benediction.

**CONCLUSION**

        As has been clearly pointed out, the Devatāmūrti-prakaraṇam of Sutrabhrt Maṇḍana, the Ātmaja, son of Srikşetra, is a compilation.

     The author has used many Texts which he has freely modified, that is, at his will he altered their readings. Such changes, as far as they concern the Dhyāna ślokās, are not authorised by the Tantra or Upāsanā śastras. We can, therefore, take these verses at best, only as mere descriptions of images, for the guidance of artists and they are not to be taken too rigorously, or to be followed too literally.

      The work demonstrates a striking spirit of rapprochement or mutual assimilation on the part of the different sects; even the Jaina deities are allotted a conspicuous place.Thus we have not only the well-known Hermaphroditic Uma-Mahesvara and the Ardha-Narisvara forms but also such composite forms as the Kṛṣṇa-Sankara, the Kṛṣṇa-Kārtikeya.

    Not only, we have such deities as Śiva-Nārāyaṇa, Hari Hara-Pitamaha, (Surya ?) Hari-Hara-Pitämaha, Candranka- Pitämaha, Hari-Hara revealing close admixture of Śiva, Visņu, Brahman, Surya and Candra; but we are told of thirty-two different images formed by the combination of Kṛṣṇa and śaṅkara-which have not, unfortunately, been described (for fear of prolixity but they must be learnt from Brahmaņas). It is, however, doubtful if all the described images were actually wor- shipped. Sadasiva Worship seems already to be extinct by the time.

   Finally, my thanks are due to the learned Editor and the Publishers of this well-known Series, who invited me to write out this Introduction to the DMP. I have tried to do my work, as best as possible, in spite of the limitations of time and resources etc., at my disposal. I shall be highly gratified if it will be of any service to students of the subject.
