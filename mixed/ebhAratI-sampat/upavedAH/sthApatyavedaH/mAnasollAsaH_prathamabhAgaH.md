**PREFACE.**  


 The first instalment of the long-announced Mānasollāsa, otherwise known as the Abhilaṣitārthachintāmaṇi, which purports to have been composed by the great Western Chalukya King Bhūlokamalla Someśvara, son of Vikramāditya VI, is now offered to the public. It is a voluminous work, extending to about 8000 Granthas, and is divided into five Viṃśatis, each containing 20 Adhyȃyas or chapters of unequal length, some chapters again including several sub- sections. The whole work is thus divided into one hundred chapters, dealing with one hundred different topics on the necessities and written for the instruction of the members of royal families. The first volume represents two among the five Viṃśatis, and comprises 40 Adbyȃyas or chapters.

The present edition is based on the following five MSS:

**A.** Belonging to the BARODA CENTRAL LIBRARY. It is a complete press-copy prepared with the help of three MSS.

**B.** Belonging to the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona. It contains 109 leaves and is, though incomplete, a very good copy.

**C.** Complete, though recent.

**D.** Complete, written in Śaka 1592. Leaves are very brittle and the MS requires very careful handling. It offers good readlings.

**E.** Incomplete; in the middle about 50 leaves are wanting. It is older than D. On the last leaves the ink has faded.

The last three MSS belong to the Bikaner Durbar.

   The authorship of the Mānasollāsa is attributed, in the 9th śloka on page 2 and the colophon, to the Chalukya King Someśvara, surnamed Bhūlokamalla and Satyāśrayakulatilaka. A reference to śloka 371 on page 62 will, however, make it evident that this attribution is incorrect. In this śloka Somesvara is himself made the standard of comparison, and no anthor would be guilty of so flagrant a piece of vanity. It is therefore probable that the book was composed in his Court by some prodigiously learned and well-informed man, thoroughly acquainted with the royal household, royal necessities and royal whims.[\*](# "Another work attributed to him is the Vikramȃṅkȃbhyudaya, an incomplete MS of which appears in one of the Pattan Bhandars. Further details of this MS with be given in our Pattan Catalogue which is in course of preparation.")

  King Someśvara is the son of Vikramāditya VI, and belongs to the line of the Western Chalukyas whose capital was at Kalyāni. Aufrecht in his *Catalogus Catalogorum* fixes the period of his reign as 1127-1138. In Barnett's *Antiquities of India* the date is 1126-1138. The date of composition of this work seems to be 1052 Śaka (1131 A. D.) as theśloka 61 on page 34 while giving theDhruvāṅka mentionsFriday as the first day of the month of Chaitra when theŚaka year 1051 had elapsed.

   It is generally believed that Someśvara ascended the throne in A. D. 1127; but the inscription recording the grant of land made by Mahāmṇdaleśvara Mârasiṃhadevarasa to the temple of Māṇikyadeva containing an image of Ekaśāleya Pâršvanātha in the 6th year of the reign of Someśvara Bhūlokamalla in the year Śaka (1052 corresponding to A.D. 1130-31) shows that the date of his accession cannot be 1127; it must be 1124-25. The real date of Someśvara's accession therefore is a matter of controversy which may better be left in the hands of the historians and antiquarians for solution. The date of accession, whether 1124 or 1127, does not, however, materially come in conflict with the date given as Dhruvānka in the Mānasollāsa already mentioned.

  Some scholars are under the impression that A. D. 1127 is the date of composition of the Mānasollāsa. But this appears from the above, and also from other considerations, to be incorrect. Someśvara ascended the throne, as is commonly believed, in 1126 or 1127. It is quite natural that a king in those days should require a few years for getting himself firmly seated on the throne, and for waging wars with neighbouring countries, which generally gave trouble when a kingdom changed hands. It seems therefore probable that the date given as Dhruvâṅka, referred to above, is the real date of composition.

   Someśvara seems to be a powerful ruler, but very little is koown of his personal history. A few inscriptions were recorded during his reign but the information yielded by them is but meagre. What his religion was, it is difficult to ascertain. Here in the beginning his book opens with an obeisance to all the important deities of the Hindu Pantheon, namely, Gaṇeśa, śiva, Visṇu, Brahmā, Indra, etc. The very first śloka refers to Gaṇeśá, but we shall not be justified in calling him a śaiva, because it is customary with authors of all sects to begin with an obeisance to Gaṇeśaas the bestower of perfection and the remover of obstacles. The grant of Mahāmaṇḍaleśvara Mârasiṃhadevarasa already referred to further makes us believe that Jainism was also encouraged in his time. Our conclusion therefore is that Someśvara also displayed the usual liberalism of Indian monarchs. The śloka 105 on page 11 further strengthens this conclusion.

   The Mānasollāsa is written in Anuṣṭubh metre, with occasional prose passages introduced in the middle. Its language is easy but florid. The work treats of many subjects and gives the maximum information in the minimum space. The work is designated by the author as the जगदाचार्यपुस्तकः, or a book which teaches the world, and the scope of the book is so extensive that it can rightly claim that epithet. An idea of the different subjects dealt with can be obtained form the table of contents; but we will mention here only a few interesting features among many that may be found in the book. It may be remembered that Someśvara was an orthodox Hindu king and the picture presented in his Mānasollāsa is of the glories, pomps and paraphernalia of a purely Indian court and royal household. The Western Chālukyas were never known to have been contaminated by the Muhammadan civilization, as they, it is believed, had been destroyed by the Hoysalas.

  In this work sometimes the author gives even minutedetails like **सिक्थादष्टगुणं ताम्रं**( on **मूर्तिविधान** in **इष्टापूर्ताध्याय** p. 9.) etc. and **तुलालक्षण**( p. 70.) and sometimes he omits the things that are really required, e. g., **एका तारा**etc. (p.106, śl. 860) where the word Tārā is not explained. The meanings of such words, however, may be found in other books like Vasantarāja Śākuna.

   Among the two ViṁŚatis contained in this volume, the first, generally speaking, describes the requisite qualifications and necessities of an ambitious king who desires to obtain and extend his dominions. The second ViṃŚati mainly gives the ways and means of making the position of the king secure.

  The first ViṃŚati while dealing with the virtues of a king makes the Tîrthasnānaan imperative necessity. In the Tirthasnānādhyāya the author mentions several Tîrthas, namely, Śuklatîrtha[\*](# "This may be one of the Narmadā near Broach or another of the same name of the Godavari."), Vañjarā[§](# "The modern Mâñjrâin the Nizam's dominions also known as Garuḍa Gaṇgā or Garutmatt, a tributary of the Godāvari. (see the 90th. Adhyâya of the Gautamî Mâhâtmya in the Brahma Purâṇa)."), Bhîmarathi, Veṇyā, the tributaries of the Kṛṣṇā, etc, such as may reasonably be known to local people. He does not however mention Puṣkara near Ajmer, which is one of the greatest Tîrthas. The mention of the Tāpî river along with the famous and mighty rivers, Ganges, Yamunā, Narmadā, Gautamî, in the same Śloka shows that the author could not shake off the local influence while speaking ofIndia in general. The omission of the Kāveri is worth noticing. It is probable also that in this particular he has followed the Brahma Purāna which also mentions the rivers in the same strain.[\*](# "See ślokas 33 and 34 of the 1stAdhyāya of Gautamî Māhātmya in the Brahma Parāṇa: Anandasrama edition p. 190.")

  The three ślokas treating of Jvara (p. 18, śl. 188-190) are taken from an earlier work on medicine by Vāgbhaṭa, but the other ślokas have not been traced so far. In this Adhyāya and in the Adhyāyas of Aśvavaidyaka and Gajacikitsā it is worth noting that all the medicines mentioned are those prepared from medicinal plants. There is no mention of Bhasma, etc or medicines prepared from metals like iron, gold, etc.

In the first Viṃśati the longest is the 19th Adhyayā called the Dinānāthabandhubhṛtyapoṣaṇādhyāya. Here the recessity of appointing excellent physicians and free distribution of medicines is emphasized. Someśvara might have realized that people must necessarily love a king who takes care of them when they are in distress.

  The second Viṃśati opens with an enumeration of the necessary qualifications of the king. Rasāyana comes next to make the king healthy and strong. Then he mentions the different officers required for the State, along with their requisite qualifications. Among the qualifications of the royal cook, one is Asaṃbhedya who cannot be bought over by the King's enemies) and the other is Krtānnasya Parikṣaka ( able to examine carefully the king'sfood). This shows that the life of a king is perpetually in danger.

  The line विशेषेण च कायस्थैःपीडिताः पालयेत्प्रजाः (p. 43śl.156.) indirectly shows that the author was well acquainted with the fact that people of the clerical profession are inclined to harass the public. It is quite possible also that he followed the previous writers on Nîti (नीति) in this respect. On page 44 he fixes one-sixth of the produce of corn as the highest royal due, though in some cases it is made one-eighth or one-twelfth as a concession. The tax depends however on the productivity of the land. He fixes also one-sixth tax on honey and ghee, but does not formulate any taxation on other kinds of produce except to mention that a fruit graden is to be taxed according to its yield.

  In those days the might of the king was calculated according to the number of elephants which he possessed. Hence the author mentions the forests which are the haunts of elephants, and minutely describes the varieties of the species and formulates means to catch them, train them, and make them fit for war.

  It is believed by the writers on elephants that the elephant is a faithless animal, but our author does not subscribe to that opinion. The only kind of elephant which is faithless is the Sarpasattva while the rogue elephants come under the category of Paiśācasattva and Rākṣasasattvasamudbhava. The code of words given here for the training of elephants must have been in use in those days in Mahārāṣṭra and Guzerat, as is evident from words such as देदे,घेघे, भले, etc, but the code is different from the one that is now in use either at Baroda or Kolhapur. The elephant, though naturally timid in disposition, is able to destroy men in war if properly trained. The last lesson received by the elephant is how to destroy men (शिक्षितंतु वधावधिp. 136, śl. 1194). In this book no less than five methods of catching elephants are given. One of them is Vāribandha, which corresponds to the well-known Kheddah operations. A mention of this in Mānasollāsa shows that the method was in vogue in those days, but was afterwards forgotten, as may be seen from the following lines of G. P. Sanderson in his "*Thirteen Year among the Wild Beasts of India* pp. 101 and 103.

   "Some of the Maharaja's mahouts who were amongst my following had been accustomed to catch single elephants with trained females, and in pitfalls, but they had never heard of any one attempting the capture of a whole herd. It was said that Hyder had made a trial, a century before, in the Kakankote jungles, but had failed, and had recorded his opinion that no one would ever succeed and his curse upon any one that attempted to do so, on a stone still standing near the scene of his endeavours. Consequently all the true Mussulmans who were with me regarded the enterprise as hopeless, though they judiciously kept that opinion to themselves. "

(p. 101)

"I was determined to make the scheme succeed if possible, not only from my love of adventure and the necessity for executing what I had suggested to Government and undertaken to carry out, but from the desire to prove to several officers who considered the scheme to be the vision of a lunatic, that their croakings were rather the utterances of Bedlamites. Pleasantries appeared in the Bangalore papers regarding the probable effects the Kheddah operations would have on the price of salt, which it was represented was being laid in by me in large quantities for application to the caudal appendages of any elephants I happened to meet with ".

(p. 103).

  The author Someśvara mentions **ब्रह्मांशक** elephantfirst. This is the only kind of elephant which is described as completely white (गौर). Modern writers on elephants say that no such elephants are found:-

  "I have never myself seen a really white one, nor have any of the experienced native hunters whom I have met "x x x Regarding the white elephants of which we read as forming the most cherished possessions of the King of Ava, I am unable to give any information".

Sanderson p. 83.

  "Occasionally so called white elephants are met with, which are really albinos, the dark pigment being absent from a larger or smaller area of the skin; in Burma and Siam such albinos being highly valued and considered as sacred or royal animals "

(*Royal Natural History, by Lydekker Vol. II, p. 529.*)

  This kind of elephant may be **गौरश्यामातनोश्छविः** mentioned on page 50, ś1. 228. This is no doubt auspicious as it leads to victory. But this is not the white elephant described by Someśvara as **ब्रम्हांशक**. The author following previous writers might have mentioned various things, of course, which he never saw.

  Two short sub-adhyāyas viz: Nidhi and Dhatuvāda, Rasāyana in this book (pp. 59-61 and 63-64) are extre mely interesting. Enriching the Government treasury by the practice of alchemy is really astonishing. Not only ordinary people were keen on alchemy but Rajas and Maharajas also had recourse to such methods.

  Where pearls and various kinds of gems are treated of, their defects also are not omitted, and mention is made of the devastating results of possessing such defective pearls and gems. On page 61, śl. 426 Someśvara says that in this Kali-age pearls such as are found in oyster shells only are available. But he enumerates eight different sources of pearls, some altogether mythical, following perhaps the tradition of previous writers: In this connection he does not rest content with mentioning the sources only, but also minutely describes the kind of pearls produced from each source. He says in one place (p. 71 śl. 471) that the king should not wear pearls which weigh more than two Kālañjas (equal to 60 Guñjās)

  On page 79 things worth storing in a fort are mentioned. In ślokas 551 to 555 the author deals with the necessity of keeping in stock stones and sand, serpents in earthen pots,and lions fixed to some convenient spot, and in fact, everything that may cause havoc in an hostile army.

   On page 80, śloka 561, we see the author advising kings not to put faith in the army formed of enemies, men, and not to allow them near his presence. He further advises that an army of this kind should always be put in the front in the event of war.

 While referring to horses, Someśvara uses the word Yavanodbhūta, by which are meant probably the Arabian horses. It appears that in his time horses from Sind, Arabia and the Kāmboja countries were famous. Among these the Arabian horses have maintained their reputation even now. He seems specially inclined towards the elephants of the Kalinga forests (कालिङ्गवनसंभवp. 136, śl. 1194). He has also treated of the medicines to be administered to horses and elephants. On page 86 and 87 the description of fever in elephants etcis worth noting. There is no mention however of any medicine for fever in the case of elephants.

  In the Vasantarāja śākuna it is mentioned that there are five jewels among the śakunas:—

**पीतकी-भषण - काक-पिङ्गला- जम्बुकप्रियतमा च पञ्चमी ।**

**पतदत्रमुनिसत्तमैः सदा कीर्त्यते शकुनरत्नपञ्चकम् ॥**

**( अर्चनाविधिप्रकरण śl.3 )**  


Among them the Potaki is the chief. The śloka runs thus -



**यतोऽखिलैः शाकुनशास्त्रविज्ञैः**

**श्यामोदिता सर्वविहङ्गमानाम् ।**

**धानभूता X X X XX**

(op. cit. p. 93)

  All the five jewels are treated in this book. śakunas like the Upaśruti are also mentioned. It may be pointed out in this connection that while giving the names of the Svaras of Piṅgalā we considered it safer to follow the Vasantarāja śâkuna as all the different MSS have different and probably incorrect readings.

  The chapters on polity give complete though succinct information about the royal policy. The three Upāyas also are briefly treated, but the fourth, viz. Daṇḍa is dwelt on at greater length.

  It treats of the Caturasra Koṭacakra and many other things dealing with astrology. It shows how the army should stand and how the kings, princes and other officers of the state should be posted. In the end the author steaks of Courts of Justice.

 We take this opportunity of recording our cordial thanks and deep gratitude to HIS EXCELLENCY SIR MANUBHAI N. MEHTA Kt, C.S.I., M.A., L.L.B., Dewan Saheb of Baroda, for the keen interest he takes in the Series, and for the kind help rendered to us by obtaining a loan of the three Bikaner Durbar MSS on his personal responsibility. Our thanks are also due to the Bikaner Durbar for their courtesy in lending us these MSS; to the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Poona, for giving the loan of their MS; and to Pandit LB. Gandhi of our Library for assistance rendered by him in many directions, such as collating MSS, reading proofs, etc.
