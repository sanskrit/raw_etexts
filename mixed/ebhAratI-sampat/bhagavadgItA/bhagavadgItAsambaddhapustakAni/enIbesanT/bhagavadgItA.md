_(<MISSING_FIG href="../books_images/U-IMG-1733302284111101-removebg-preview__1_-removebg-preview-removebg-preview.png"/>)MONG the priceless teachings that may be foundin the great Hindu poem of the *Mahâbhârata*,there is none so rare and precious as this--"The Lord'sSong." Since it fell from the divine lips of ShriKrishna on the field of battle, and stilled the surgingemotions of his disciple and friend, how many troubledhearts has it quieted and strengthened, how manyweary souls has it led to Him! It is meant to lift theaspirant from the lower levels of renunciation, whereobjects are renounced, to the loftier heights wheredesires are dead, and where the Yogi dwells in caimand ceaseless contemplation, while his body and mindare actively employed in discharging the duties thatfall to his lot in life. That the spiritual man need notbe a recluse, that union with the divine Life may beachieved and maintained in the midst of worldlyaffairs, that the obstacles to that union lie not outsideus but within us-such is the central lesson of theBHAGAVAD-GITA.

 It is a scripture of Yoga; now Yoga is literallyunion, and it means harmony with the divine Law,the becoming one with the divine Life, by the subdualof all outward-going energies, To reach this, balance

must be gained, equilibrium, so that the self, joined tothe Self, shall not be affected by pleasure or pain, desireor aversion, or any of the "pairs of opposites"between which untrained selves swing backwards andforwards. Moderation is therefore the keynote of theGita, and the harmonising of all the constituents ofman, till they vibrate in perfect attunement with theOne, the Supreme Self. This is the aim the disciple isto set before him. He must learn not to be attractedby the attractive, nor repelled by the repellent, butmust see both as manifestations of the one Lord, sothat they may be lessons for his guidance, not fettersfor his bondage. In the midst of turmoil he must restin the Lord of Peace, discharging every duty to thefullest, not because he seeks the results of his actions,but because it is his duty to perform them. His heartis an altar, love to his Lord the flame burning upon it;all his acts, physical and mental, are sacrifices offeredon the altar; and once offered, he has with them nofurther concern,

 As though to make the lesson more impressive, itwas given on a field of battle. Arjuna, the warrior-prince, was to vindicate his brother's title, to destroya usurper who was oppressing the land; it was hisduty as prince, as warrior, to fight for the deliveranceof his nation and to restore order and peace. To makethe contest more bitter, loved comrades and friendsstood on both sides, wringing his heart with personalanguish, and making a conflict of duties as well asphysical strife. Could he slay those to whom heowed love and duty, and trample on ties of kindred ?

To break family ties was a sin; to leave the people incruel bondage was a sin; where was the right way?Justice must be done, else law would be disregarded;but how slay without sin? The answer is the burdenof the book: Have no personal interest in the event;carry out the duty imposed by the position in life,realise that Ishvara, at once Lord and Law is thedoer, working out the mighty evolution that ends inbliss and peace; be identified with Him by devotion,and then perform duty as duty, fighting withoutpassion or desire, without anger or hatred; thusactivity forges no bonds, Yoga is accomplished andthe soul is free.

 Such is the obvious teaching of this sacred book.But as all the acts of an Avatâra are symbolical, wemay pass from the outer to the inner planes, and seein the fight of Kurukshetra the battlefield of the soul,and in the sons of Dhritarâshtra enemies it meets inits progress; Arjuna becomes the type of the struggling soul of the disciple, and shri Krishna is the Logosof the soul. Thus the teaching of the ancient battlefield gives guidance in all later days, and trains theaspiring soul in treading the steep and thorny paththat leads to peace. To all such souls in East andWest come these divine lessons, for the path is one,though it has many names, and all souls seek thesame goal, though they may not realise their unity.

 In order to preserve the precision of the Sanskrit, afew technical terms have been given in the original infoot-notes; Manah is the mind, both in the lowermental processes in which it is swayed by the senses,

by passions and emotions, and in the higher processesof reasoning; Buddhi is the faculty above the ratiocinating mind, and is the Pure Reason, exercising thediscriminative faculty of intuition, of spiritual discernment; if these original words are not known tothe reader, the BHAGAVAD GITA loses much of itspractical value as a treatise on Yoga, and the wouldbe learner becomes confused.

 The epithets applied to Shri Krishna and Arjuna– the variety of which is so characteristic of Sanskritconversation-are for the most part left untranslated,as being musical they thus add to the literary charm,whereas the genius of English is so different from thatof Sanskrit, that the many-footed epithets becomesometimes almost grotesque in translation. Namesderived from that of an ancestor, as Partha, meaningthe son of Prithâ, Kaunteya, meaning the son ofKuntî, are used in one form or the other, according tothe rhythm of the sentence. One other trifling matter,which is yet not trifling if it aids the student: whenAtm means the One Self, the SELF of all, it is printedin small capitals; where it means the lower, thepersonal self, it is printed in ordinary type; this isdone because there is sometimes a play on the word,and it is difficult for an untrained reader to follow themeaning without some such assistance. The wordBrahman, the ONE, the Supreme, is throughout translated the "ETERNAL" The word "Deva," literally"Shining One," is thus translated throughout. Theuse of the Western word "God" a like for "Brahman"and for the "Devas" is most misleading; the Hindu

never uses the one for the other, and never blurs theunity of the Supreme by the multiplicity of ministering Intelligences.

 My wish, in adding this translation to those alreadybefore the public, was to preserve the spirit of theoriginal, especially in its deeply devotional tone, whileat the same time giving an accurate translation,reflecting the strength and the terseness of theSanskrit. In order that mistakes, due to my imperfectknowledge, might be corrected, all of this translationhas passed through the hands of one or other of thefollowing gentlemen-friends of mine at Benares – towhom I here tender my grateful acknowledgments:Bâbus Pramada Das Mitra, Gangânath Jhâ, KâliCharan Mitra, and Upendranath Basu. A few of thenotes are also due to them. In the third and fourtheditions I have also been much helped by BâbuBhagavân Dâs, to whom I add my cordial thanks.

NOTE TO THE FIRST EDITION.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

It has long been my ambition to place within theeasy reach of the English-reading public a cheapedition of the Bhagavad-Gita with the text inDevanagari and an English translation of the same.Mrs. Annie Besant, that warm and tried friend ofIndia whose services to our land it were vain tocount, has enabled me to realise that ambition bygenerously granting the use of her English translation. It is devoutly hoped that this great scriptureof the Hindus will find a place in thousands of homesboth in India and elsewhere.

**व्यामिश्रेणेव वाक्येन बुद्धिं मोहयसीव मे।  
तदेकं वद निश्चित्य येन श्रेयोऽहमाप्नुयाम्॥२॥**

 With these perplexing words Thou only confusest my understanding[^79]therefore tell me with certainty the one way by which I may reach bliss.(2)

[^79]: "* Buddhi,"

**श्रीभगवानुवाच।**

**लोकेऽस्मिन्द्विविधा निष्ठा पुरा प्रोक्ता मयाऽनघ।  
ज्ञानयोगेन साङ्ख्यानां कर्मयोगेन योगिनाम्॥३॥**

The Blessed Lord said:

 In this world there is a twofold path, as I before said, O sinless one that of yoga by know- ledge, of the Sâñkhyas ; and that of yoga by action, of the Yogis.(3)

**न कर्मणामनारम्भान्नैष्कर्म्यं पुरुषोऽश्नुते।  
न च संन्यसनादेव सिद्धिं समधिगच्छति॥४॥**

 Man winneth not freedom from action by abstaining from activity, nor by mere renunciation doth he rise to perfection.(4)

**न हि कश्चित्क्षणमपि जातु तिष्ठत्यकर्मकृत्।  
कार्यते ह्यवशः कर्म सर्वः प्रकृतिजैर्गुणैः॥५॥**

 Nor can anyone, even for an instant, remain really actionless; for helplessly is everyone driven to action by the qualities[^80]born of nature[^81]. (5)

[^80]: "* Gunas."

[^81]: "+ Prakriti."

**कर्मेन्द्रियाणि संयम्य य आस्ते मनसा स्मरन्।  
इन्द्रियार्थान्विमूढात्मा मिथ्याचारः स उच्यते॥६॥**

 Who sitteth, controlling the organs of action, but dwelling in his mind\* on the objects of the senses, that bewildered man is called a hypocrite. (6)

**यस्त्विन्द्रियाणि मनसा नियम्यारभतेऽर्जुन।  
कर्मेन्द्रियैः कर्मयोगमसक्तः स विशिष्यते॥७॥**

 But who, controlling the senses by the mind[^82]O Arjuna, with the organs of action without attachment, performeth yoga by action[^83], he is worthy,(7)

[^82]: "* Manah."

[^83]: "Karma-Yoga is the consecration of physical energy on the divine Altar; ie, the using of one's organs of action simply in service, in obedience to Law and Duty."

**नियतं कुरु कर्म त्वं कर्म ज्यायो ह्यकर्मणः।  
शरीरयात्राऽपि च ते न प्रसिध्येदकर्मणः॥८॥**

 Perform thou right[^84] action, for, action is rior to inaction, and, inactive, even the maintenance of thy body would not be possible.(8)

[^84]: "Regulated, prescribed as a duty; or, regularly."

**यज्ञार्थात्कर्मणोऽन्यत्र लोकोऽयं कर्मबन्धनः।  
तदर्थं कर्म कौन्तेय मुक्तसङ्गः समाचर॥९॥**

 The world is bound by action, unless performed for the sake of sacrifice; for that sake, free from attachment, O son of Kuntî, perform thou action.(9)

**सहयज्ञाः प्रजाः सृष्ट्वा पुरोवाच प्रजापतिः।  
अनेन प्रसविष्यध्वमेष वोऽस्त्ष्टिकामधुक्॥१०॥**

 Having in ancient times emanated mankind together with sacrifice, the Lord of emanation[^85]said: " By this shall ye propagate; be this to you the giver of desire[^86]
(10)

[^85]: "* Prajâpati."

[^86]: "+ Kâmadhuk, the cow of Indra, from which each could milk what he wished for; hence the giver of desired objects."

**देवान्भावयतानेन ते देवा भावयन्तु वः।  
परस्परं भावयन्तः श्रेयः परमवाप्स्यथ॥११॥**

 "With this nourish ye the Shining Ones, and

may the Shining Ones nourish you; thus nourishing one another ye shall reap the supremest good. (11)

**इष्टान्भोगान्हि वो देवा दास्यन्ते यज्ञभाविताः।  
तैर्दत्तानप्रदायैभ्यो यो भुङ्क्ते स्तेन एव सः॥१२॥**

 “For, nourished by sacrifice, the Shining Ones shall bestow on you the enjoyments you desire." A thief verily is he who enjoyeth what is given by Them without returning Them aught.(12)

**यज्ञशिष्टाशिनः सन्तो मुच्यन्ते सर्वकिल्बिषैः।  
भुञ्जते ते त्वघं पापा ये पचन्त्यात्मकारणात्॥१३॥**

 The righteous, who eat the remains of the sacrifice, are freed from all sins; but the impious, who dress food for their own sakes, they verily eat sin.(13)

**अन्नाद्भवन्ति भूतानि पर्जन्यादन्नसंभवः।  
यज्ञाद्भवति पर्जन्यो यज्ञः कर्मसमुद्भवः॥१४॥**

 From food creatures become; from rain is the

production of food; rain proceedeth from sacrifice; sacrifice ariseth out of action.(14)

**कर्म ब्रह्मोद्भवं विद्धि ब्रह्माऽक्षरसमुद्भवम्।  
तस्मात्सर्वगतं ब्रह्म नित्यं यज्ञे प्रतिष्ठितम्॥१५॥**

 Know thou that from Brahma[^87]action groweth, and Brahma from the Imperishable cometh. Therefore the ETERNAL, the all-permeating, is ever present in sacrifice.(15)

[^87]: "*An Indian of much knowledge translates Brahma here as “the Vedas. "

**एवं प्रवर्तितं चक्रं नानुवर्तयतीह यः।  
अघायुरिन्द्रियारामो मोघं पार्थ स जीवति॥१६॥**

 He who on earth doth not follow the wheel thus revolving, sinful of life and rejoicing in the senses, he, O son of Pritha, liveth in vain.(16)

**यस्त्वात्मरतिरेव स्यादात्मतृप्तश्च मानवः।  
आत्मन्येव च सन्तुष्टस्तस्य कार्यंन विद्यते॥१७॥**

  But the man who rejoiceth in the SELF, with

the SELF is satisfied, and is content in the SELF, for him verily there is nothing to do ;(17)

**नैव तस्य कृतेनार्थो नाकृतेनेह कश्चन।  
न चास्य सर्वभूतेषु कश्चिदर्थव्यपाश्रयः॥१८॥**

For him there is no interest in things done, in this world, nor any in things not done, nor doth any object of his depend on any being.(18)

**तस्मादसक्तः सततं कार्यंकर्म समाचर।  
असक्तो ह्याचरन्कर्म परमाप्नोति पूरुषः॥१९॥**

 Therefore, without attachment, constantly perform action which is duty, for, by performing action without attachment, man verily reacheth the Supreme.(19)

**कर्मणैव हि संसिद्धिमास्थिता जनकादयः।  
लोकसङ्ग्रहमेवापि सम्पश्यन्कर्तुमर्हसि॥२०॥**

 Janaka and others indeed attained to perfection by action then having an eye to the welfare of he world also, thou shouldst perform action. (20)

**यद्यदाचरति श्रेष्ठस्तत्तदेवेतरो जनः।  
स यत्प्रमाणं कुरुते लोकस्तदनुवर्तते॥२१॥**

 Whatsoever a great man doeth, that other men also do; the standard he setteth up, by that the people go.(21)

**न मे पार्थास्ति कर्तव्यं त्रिषु लोकेषु किञ्चन।  
नानवाप्तमवाप्तव्यं वर्त एव च कर्मणि॥२२॥**

 There is nothing in the three worlds, O Pârtha, that should be done by Me, nor anything un- attained that might be attained; yet I mingle in action.(22)

**यदि ह्यहं न वर्तेयं जातु कर्मण्यतन्द्रितः।  
मम वर्त्मानुवर्तन्ते मनुष्याः पार्थ सर्वशः॥२३॥**

 For if I mingled not ever in action unwearied, men all around would follow My path, O son of Prithâ.(23)

**उत्सीदेयुरिमे लोका न कुर्यांकर्म चेदहम्।  
सङ्करस्य च कर्ता स्यामुपहन्यामिमाः प्रजाः॥२४॥**

 These worlds would fall into ruin, if I did not perform action; I should be the author of confusion of castes, and should destroy these creatures,(24)

**सक्ताः कर्मण्यविद्वांसो यथा कुर्वन्ति भारत।  
कुर्याद्विद्वांस्तथाऽसक्तश्चिकीर्षुर्लोकसङ्ग्रहम्॥२५॥**

 As the ignorant act from attachment to action, O Bhârata, so should the wise act without attachment, desiring the welfare of the world.(25)

**न बुद्धिभेदं जनयेदज्ञानां कर्मसङ्गिनाम्।  
जोषयेत्सर्वकर्माणि विद्वान्युक्तः समाचरन्॥२६॥**

 Let no wise man unsettle the mind of ignorant people attached to action; but acting in harmony with Mo let him render all action attractive. (26)

**प्रकृतेः क्रियमाणानि गुणैः कर्माणि सर्वशः।  
अहङ्कारविमूढात्मा कर्ताऽहमिति मन्यते॥२७॥**

 All actions are wrought by the quali-

ties[^80] of nature only. The self, deluded by egoism[^89]thinketh: "I am the doer."(27)

[^89]: "+Ahamkâra, the separate I am"

**तत्त्ववित्तु महाबाहो गुणकर्मविभागयोः।  
गुणा गुणेषु वर्तन्त इति मत्वा न सज्जते ॥२८॥**

 But he, O mighty-armed, who knoweth the essence of the divisions of the qualities and functions, holding that "the qualities move amid the qualities[^90]is not attached.(28)

[^90]: "The Gunas, "

**प्रकृतेर्गुणसम्मूढाः सज्जन्ते गुणकर्मसु।  
तानकृत्स्नविदो मन्दान्कृत्स्नविन्नविचालयेत् ॥२९॥**

 Those deluded by the qualities of nature are attached to the functions of the qualities. The man of perfect knowledge should not unsettle the foolish whose knowledge is imperfect.(29)  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

+qualities, as sense-organs move amid the Gunas, qualities, as sense-objects. A suggested reading is "The functions dwell in the propensities." Sankarâchârya says, "of the class of qualities and the class of actions;" or the arrangement, or relations of qualities and actions.

**मयि सर्वाणि कर्माणि संन्यस्याऽध्यात्मचेतसा।  
निराशीर्निर्ममो भूत्वा युध्यस्व विगतज्वरः॥३०॥**

 Surrendering all actions to Me, with thy thoughts resting on the supreme SELF, from hope and egoism freed, and of mental fever cured, engage in battle.(30)

**ये मे मतमिदं नित्यमनुतिष्ठन्ति मानवाः।  
श्रद्धावन्तोऽनसूयन्तो मुच्यन्ते तेऽपि कर्मभिः॥३१॥**

 Who abide ever in this teaching of Mine full of faith and free from caviling, they too are released from actions.(31)

**ये त्वेतदभ्यसूयन्तो नानुतिष्ठन्ति मे मतम्।  
सर्वज्ञानविमूढांस्तान्विद्धि नष्टानचेतसः॥३२॥**

 Who carp at My teaching and act not thereon, senseless, deluded in all knowledge, know thou these mindlees ones as fated to be destroyed. (32)

**सदृशं चेष्टते स्वस्याः प्रकृतेर्ज्ञानवानपि।  
प्रकृतिं यान्ति भूतानि निग्रहः किं करिष्यति॥३३॥**

 Even the man of knowledge behaves in confor mity with his own nature; beings follow nature'; what shall restraint avail ?(33)

**इन्द्रियस्येन्द्रियस्यार्थेरागद्वेषौ व्यवस्थितौ।  
तयोर्न वशमागच्छेत्तौ ह्यस्य परिपन्थिनौ॥३४॥**

 Affection and aversion for the objects of sense abide in the senses; let none come under the dominion of these two they are obstructors of the path.(34)

**श्रेयान्स्वधर्मो विगुणः परधर्मात्स्वनुष्ठितात्।  
स्वधर्मे निधनं श्रेयः परधर्मो भयावहः॥३५॥**

 Better one's own duty[^91]though destitute of merit, than the duty[^91] of another, well discharged. Better death in the discharge of one's own duty ;\* the duty\* of another is full of danger.(35)

The Blessed Lord said:

 This imperishable yoga I declared to Vivasvân; Vivasvân taught it to Manu; Manu to Ikshvâku told it.(1)

**एवं परम्पराप्राप्तमिमं राजर्षयो विदुः।  
स कालेनेह महता योगो नष्टः परन्तप॥२॥**

 This, handed on down the line, the King-Sages knew. This yoga by great efflux of time decayed in the world, O Parantapa.(2)

**स एवायं मया तेऽद्य योगः प्रोक्तः पुरातनः।

 This same ancient yoga hath been to-day declared to thee by Me, for thou art My devotee and My friend; it is the supreme Secret. (3)

**वीतरागभयक्रोधा मन्मया मामुपाश्रिताः।

 Freed from passion, fear and anger, filled with Me, taking refuge in Me, purified in the fire[^104] of wisdom, many have entered into My Being.(10)

[^104]: "* Tapas, from tap, blazing like fire."

**ये यथा मां प्रपद्यन्ते तांस्तथैव भजाम्यहम्।

 They who long after success in action on earth worship the Shining Ones ; for in brief space verily, in this world of men, success is born of action. (12)

**चातुर्वर्ण्यंमया सृष्टं गुणकर्मविभागशः।

 The four castes were emanated by Me, by the different distribution of qualities[^80] and actions ; know Me to be the author of them, though the actionless and inexhaustible. (13)

**न मां कर्माणि लिम्पन्ति न मे कर्मफले स्पृहा।  
इति मां योऽभिजानाति कर्मभिर्न स बद्ध्यते ॥१४॥**

 Nor do actions affect Me, nor is the fruit of action desired by Me. He who thus knoweth Me is not bound by actions. (14)

**एवं ज्ञास्वा कृतं कर्म पूर्वैरपि मुमुक्षुभिः।  
कुरु कर्मैव तस्मात्त्वं पूर्वैः पूर्वतरं कृतम्॥१५॥**

 Having thus known, our forefathers, ever seek-ing liberation, performed action; therefore do thou also perform action, as did our forefathers in the olden time. (15)

**किं कर्म किमकर्मेति कवयोऽप्यत्र मोहिताः।  
तत्ते कर्म प्रवक्ष्यामि यज्ज्ञात्वा मोक्ष्यसेऽशुभात्॥१६॥**

 “ What is action, what inaction "? Even the wise are herein perplexed. Therefore I will declare to thee the action by knowing which thou shalt be loosed from evil. (16)

**कर्मणो ह्यपि बोद्धव्यं बोद्धव्यं च विकर्मणः।  
अकर्मणश्चबोद्धव्यं गहना कर्मणो गतिः॥१७॥**

 It is needful to discriminate action, to dis-criminate unlawful action, and to discriminate inaction ; mysterious is the path of action. (17)

**कर्मण्यकर्म यः पश्येदकर्मणि च कर्म यः।

 He who seeth inaction in action, and action in inaction, he is wise among men, he is har-monious, even while performing all action.(18)

**यस्य सर्वे समारम्भाः कामसङ्कल्पवर्जिताः।  
ज्ञानाग्निदग्धकर्माणं तमाहुः पण्डितं बुधाः॥१९॥**

 Whose works are all free from the moulding of desire, whose actions are burned up by the fire of wisdom, him the wise have called a Sage.( 19 )

**त्यक्त्वा कर्मफलासङ्गं नित्यतृप्तो निराश्रयः।

 Hoping for naught, his mind and self control-led, having abandoned all greed, performing action by the body alone, he doth not commit sin. (21)

**यदृच्छालाभसन्तुष्टो द्वन्द्वातीतो विमत्सरः।

 Content with whatsoever he obtaineth without effort, free from the pairs of opposites, without envy, balanced in success and failure, though acting.he is not bound.(22)

**गतसङ्गस्य मुक्तस्य ज्ञानावस्थितचेतसः।

 Of one with attachment dead, harmonious, with his thoughts established in wisdom, his works sacrifices, all action melts away.(23)

**ब्रह्मार्पणं ब्रह्म हविर्ब्रह्माग्नौ ब्रह्मणा हुतम्।  
ब्रह्मैव तेन गन्तव्यं ब्रह्मकर्मसमाधिना॥२४॥**

 The ETERNAL the oblation, the ETERNAL the clarified butter, are offered in the ETERNAL the

**सर्वाणीन्द्रियकर्माणि प्राणकर्माणि चापरे।

 Yet others pour as sacrifice the outgoing breath in the incoming, and the incoming in the out- going, restraining the flow of the outgoing and

incoming breaths, solely absorbed in the control of breathing[^108] (29)

[^108]: "* Prânâyâma, restraint of breath, a technical name for this practice."

**अपरे नियताहाराः प्राणान्प्राणेषु जुह्वति।

**यज्ञशिष्टामृतभुजो यान्ति ब्रह्म सनातनम्।

 As the burning fire reduces fuel to ashes, O Arjuna, so doth the fire of wisdom reduce all actions to ashes.(37)

**न हि ज्ञानेन सदृशं पवित्रमिह विद्यते।  
तत्स्वयं योगसंसिद्धः कालेनात्मनि विन्दति॥३८॥**

 Verily there is no purifier in this world like wisdom; he that is perfected in yoga finds it in the SELF in due season.(38)

**श्रद्धावाँल्लभते ज्ञानं तत्परः संयतेन्द्रियः।  
ज्ञानं लब्ध्वा परां शान्तिमचिरेणाधिगच्छति॥३९॥**

 The man who is full of faith[^112]obtaineth wisdom, and he also who hath mastery over his senses; and, having obtained wisdom, he goeth swiftly to the supreme Peace.(39)

[^112]: "* Who is intent upon faith."

**अज्ञश्चाश्रद्दधानश्च संशयात्मा विनश्यति।  
नायं लोकोऽस्ति न परो न सुखं संशयात्मनः॥४०॥**

 But the ignorant, faithless, doubting self goeth to destruction ; nor this world, nor that beyond,nor happiness, is there for the doubting self. (40)

**योगसंन्यस्तकर्माणं ज्ञानसञ्छिन्नसंशयम्।  
आत्मवन्तं न कर्माणि निबध्नन्ति धनञ्जय॥४१॥**

 He who hath renounced actions by yoga, who hath cloven asunder doubt by wisdom, who is ruled by the SELF[^113]actions do not bind him, O Dhananjaya. (41)

[^113]: "*  Madhusûdana explains âtmavantam as always watchful."

**तस्मादज्ञानसम्भूतं हृत्स्थं ज्ञानासिनाऽऽत्मनः।  
छित्त्वैनं संशयं योगमातिष्ठोत्तिष्ठ भारत॥४२॥**

 Therefore, with the sword of the wisdom of the SELF cleaving asunder this ignorance-born doubt dwelling in thy heart, be established in yoga, Stand up, O. Bharata. (42)

**इति श्रीमद्भगवद्गीतासूप० ज्ञानविभागयोगो नाम चतुर्थी-  
ऽध्यायः।**

 Thus in the glorious Upanishads of the BHAGAVAD-GITA, the science of the ETERNAL, the scripture of Yoga the dialogue between Shri Krishna and Arjuna, the fourth discourse, entitled :

**THE YOGA OF WISDOM.**

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

**FIFTH DISCOURSE**

**अर्जुन उवाच।**

**संन्यासं कर्मणां कृष्ण पुनर्योगं च शंससि।  
यच्छ्रेय एतयोरेकं तन्मे ब्रूहि सुनिश्चितम्॥१॥**

Arjuna said :

 Renunciation of actions Thou praisest, O Krishna, and then also yoga. Of the two which one is the better? That tell me conclusively. (1)

**श्रीभगवानुवाच।**

**संन्यासः कर्मयोगश्च निःश्रेयसकरावुभौ।  
तयोस्तु कर्मसंन्यासात्कर्मयोगो विशिष्यते॥२॥**

The Blessed Lord said:

 Renunciation and yoga by action both lead to the highest bliss; of the two, yoga by action is verily better than renunciation of action.(2)

**ज्ञेयः स नित्यसंन्यासी यो न द्वेष्टि न काङ्क्षति।  
निर्द्वन्द्वो हि महाबाहो सुखं बन्धात्प्रमुच्यते॥३॥**

 He should be known as a perpetual ascetic[^114]who neither hateth nor desireth; free from the pairs of opposites, O mighty-armed, he is easily set free from bondage.(3)

[^114]: "*Sannyâsi; one who renounces all."

**साङ्ख्ययोगौ पृथग्बालाः प्रवदन्ति न पण्डिताः।  
एकमप्यास्थितः सम्यगुभयोर्विन्दते फलम्॥४॥**

 Children, not sages, speak of the Sâukhya[^115] and the Yoga[^116] as different; he who is duly esta-blished in one obtaineth the fruits of both.(4)

[^115]: "+ See footnote, page 32."

[^116]: "+ Ibid."

**यत्साङ्ख्यैः प्राप्यते स्थानं तद्योगैरपि गम्यते।  
एकं साङ्ख्यं च योगं च यः पश्यति स पश्यति॥५॥**

 That place which is gained by the Sânkhyas is reached by the Yogîs also. He seeth, who seeth that the Sânkhya and the Yoga are one.(5)

**संन्यासस्तु महाबाहो दुःखमाप्तुमयोगतः।  
योगयुक्तो मुनिर्ब्रह्म न चिरेणाधिगच्छति॥६॥**

 But without yoga, O mighty-armed, renun-ciation is hard to attain to; the yoga-harmonised Muni swiftly goeth to the ETERNAL.(6)

**योगयुक्तोविशुद्धात्मा विजितात्मा जितेन्द्रियः।  
सर्वभूतात्मभूतात्मा कुर्वन्नपि न लिप्यते॥७॥**

 He who is harmonised by yoga, the self puri-fied, SELF-ruled, the senses subdued, whose SELF is the SELF of all beings, although acting he is not affected.(7)

**नैव किञ्चित्करोमीति युक्तो मन्येत तत्त्ववित्।  
पश्यन्शृण्वन्स्पृशञ्जिघ्रन्नश्नन्गच्छन्श्वसन्स्वपन्॥८॥**

 "I do not anything," should think the harmo.. nised one, who knoweth the essence of things; seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, moving, sleeping, breathing.(8)

**प्रलपन्विसृजन्गृह्णन्नुन्मिषन्निमिषन्नपि।  
इन्द्रियाणीन्द्रियार्थेषु वर्तन्त इति धारयन्॥९॥**

 Speaking, giving, grasping, opening and closing

the eyes, he holdeth: "The senses move among the objects of the senses."(9)

**ब्रह्मण्याधाय कर्माणि सङ्गं त्यक्त्वा करोति यः।  
लिप्यते न स पापेन पद्मपत्रमिवाम्भसा॥१०॥**

 He who acteth, placing all actions in the E:ERNAL, abandoning attachment, is unaffected by sin as a lotus leaf by the waters.(10)

**कायेन मनसा बुद्ध्या केवलैरिन्द्रियैरपि।  
योगिनः कर्म कुर्वन्ति सङ्गं त्यक्त्वाऽऽत्मशुद्धये॥११॥**

 Yogis, having abandoned attachment, perform action only by the body, by the mind[^61]by theReason[^74] †, and even by the senses, for the purifi cation of the self. (11)

**युक्तः कर्मफलं त्यक्त्वा शान्तिमाप्नोति नैष्ठिकीम्।  
अयुक्तः कामकारेण फले सक्तो निबध्यते॥१२॥**

 The harmonised man, having abandoned the fruit of action, attaineth to the eternal Peace;

the non-harmonised, impelled by desire, atticbed to fruit, are bound.(12)

**सर्वकर्माणि मनसा संन्यस्यास्ते सुखं वशी।  
नवद्वारे पुरे देही नैव कुर्वन्न कारयन्॥१३॥**

 Mentally renouncing all actions, the sovereign dweller in the body resteth serenely in the nine gated city[^119]neither acting nor causing to act. (13)

[^119]: "* The body, often called the city of the ETERNAL."

**न कर्तृत्वं न कर्माणि लोकस्य सृजति प्रभुः।  
न कर्मफलसंयोगं स्वभावस्तु प्रवर्तते॥१४॥**

 The Lord of the world produceth not the idea of agency, nor actions, nor the union together of action and its fruit; nature, however, mani-festeth.(14)

**नादत्ते कस्यचित्पापं न चैव सुकृतं विभुः।  
अज्ञानेनावृतं ज्ञानं तेन मुह्यन्ति जन्तवः॥१५॥**

 The Lord accepteth neither the evil-doing nor

yet the well-doing of any. Wisdom is enveloped by unwisdom ; therewith mortals are deluded.(15)

**ज्ञानेन तु तदज्ञानं येषां नाशितमात्मनः।  
तेषामादित्यवज्ज्ञानं प्रकाशयति तत्परम्॥१६॥**

 Verily, in whom unwisdom is destroyed by the wisdom of the SELF, in them wisdom, shining as the sun, reveals the Supreme.(16)

**तद्बुद्धयस्तदात्मानस्तन्निष्ठास्तत्परायणाः।  
गच्छन्त्यपुनरावृत्तिं ज्ञाननिर्धूतकल्मषाः॥१७॥**

 Thinking on THAT, merged in THAT, established in THAT, solely devoted to THAT, they go whence there is no return, their sins dispelled by wisdom.(17)

**विद्याविनयसम्पन्ने ब्राह्मणे गवि हस्तिनि।  
शुनि चैव श्वपाके च पण्डिताः समदर्शिनः॥१८॥**

 Sages look equally on a Brâhmana adorned

with learning and humility, a cow, an elephant, and even a dog and an outcaste[^120] (18)

[^120]: "*Shvapâka, the lowest class of outcastes."

**इहैव तैर्जितः सर्गो येषां साम्ये स्थितं मनः।  
निर्दोषं हि समं ब्रह्म तस्माद्ब्रह्मणि ते स्थिताः॥१९॥**

 Even here on earth everything is overcome by those whose mind[^121]remains balanced; the ETER-NAL is incorruptible and balanced; therefore they are established in the ETERNAL.(19)

[^121]: "+ Manah."

**न प्रहृष्येत्प्रियं प्राप्य नोद्विजेत्प्राप्य चाप्रियम्।  
स्थिरबुद्धिरसंमूढो ब्रह्मविद्ब्रह्मणि स्थितः॥२०॥**

 With Reason[^74] firm, unperplexed, the knower of the ETERNAL established in the ETERNAL, neither rejoiceth on obtaining what is pleasant, nor sorroweth on obtaining what is unpleasant. (20)

**बाह्यस्पर्शेष्वसक्तात्मा विन्दत्यात्मनि यत्सुखम्।  
स ब्रह्मयोगयुक्तात्मा सुखमक्षय्यमश्नुते॥२१॥**

 He, whose self is unattached to external con-tacts and findeth joy in the SELF, having the self harmonisel with the ETERNAL by yoga, enjoys imperishable bliss.(21)

**ये हि संस्पर्शजा भोगा दुःखयोनय एव ते।  
आद्यन्तवन्तः कौन्तेय न तेषु रमते बुधः॥२२॥**

 The delights that are contact-born, they are verily wombs of pain, for they have beginning and ending, O Kaunteya ; not in them may re-joice the wise. (22)

**शक्नोतीहैव यः सोढुं प्राक् शरीरविमोक्षणात्।  
कामक्रोधोद्भवं वेगं स युक्तः स सुखी नरः॥२३॥**

 He who is able to endure here on earth, ere he be liberated from the body, the force born from desire and passion, he is harmonised, he is a happy man.(23)

**योऽन्तःसुखोऽन्तरारामस्तथान्तर्ज्योतिरेव यः।  
स योगी ब्रह्मनिर्वाणं ब्रह्मभूतोऽधिगच्छति॥२४॥**

 He who is happy within, who rejoiceth within, who is illuminated within, that Yogî, becoming the ETERNAL, goeth to the Peace[^123]of the ETERNAL.(24)

[^123]: "* Nirvâna."

**लभन्ते ब्रह्मनिर्वाणमृषयः क्षीणकल्मषाः।  
छिन्नद्वैधा यतात्मानःसर्वभूतहिते रताः॥२५II**

 Rishis, their sins destroyed, their duality re-moved, their selves controlled, intent upon the welfare of all beings, obtain the Peace[^371]of the ETERNAL,(25)

[^371]: #

**कामक्रोधवियुक्तानां यतीनां यतचेतसाम्।  
अभितो ब्रह्मनिर्वाणं वर्तते विदितात्मनाम्॥२६॥**

 The Peace[^372] of the ETERNAL lies near to those who know themselves, who are disjoined from desire and passion, subdued in nature, of subdued thoughts. (26)

[^372]: #

**स्पर्शान्कृत्वा बहिर्बाह्यांश्चक्षुश्चैवान्तरे भ्रुवोः।  
प्राणापानौ समौ कृत्वा नासाभ्यन्तरचारिणौ॥२७॥**

 Having external contacts excluded, and with gaze fixed between the eyebrows; having made mequal the outgoing and ingoing breaths moving within the nostrils ; (27)

**यतेन्द्रियमनोबुद्धिर्मुनिर्मोक्षपरायणः।  
विगतेच्छाभयक्रोधो यः सदा मुक्त एव सः॥२८॥**

 With senses, mind[^82]and Reason[^74] ever con-trolled, solely pursuing liberation, the Sage,having for ever cast away desire, fear and passion, verily is liberated. (28)

**भोक्तारं यज्ञतपसां सर्वलोकमहेश्वरम्।  
सुहृदं सर्वभूतानां ज्ञात्वा मां शान्तिमृच्छति॥२९॥**

 Having known Me, as the Enjoyer of sacrifice and of austerity, the mighty Ruler of all the

worlds, and the Lover of all beings, he goeth to Peace. (29)

**इति श्रीमद्भगवद्गीतासूप० संन्यासयोगो नाम पञ्चमोऽध्यायः।**

 Thus in the glorious Upanishads of the BHAGAVAD-GITA, the science of the ETERNAL, the scripture of Yoga, in the dialogue between ShrîKrishna and Arjuna, the fifth discourse, entitled :

**THE YOGA OF THE RENUNCIATION OF**

**ACTION.**

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

**SIXTH DISCOURSE**

**श्रीभगवानुवाच।**

**अनाश्रितः कर्मफलं कार्य कर्म करोति यः।  
स संन्यासी च योगी च न निरग्निर्न चाक्रियः॥१॥**

The Blessed Lord said :

 He that performeth such action as his duty, independently of the fruit of action, he is an ascetic[^126]he is a Yogî, not he that is without fire, and without rites.(1)

[^126]: "* The ascetic, the Sannyâsî, lights no sacrificial fire and performs no sacrifices nor ceremonies; but merely to omit these, without true renunciation, is I not to be a real ascetic."

**यं संन्यासमिति प्राहुर्योगं तं विद्धि पाण्डव।  
न ह्यसंन्यस्तसङ्कल्पो योगी भवति कश्चन॥२॥**

 That which is called renunciation, know thou that as yoga, O Pândava; nor doth any one be-come a Yogîwith the formative will[^127] unrenounc-ed.(2)

[^127]: "+ Sankalpa, the imaginative faculty that makes plans for the future."

**आरुरुक्षोर्मुनेर्योगं कर्म कारणमुच्यते।  
योगारूढस्यतस्यैव शमः कारणमुच्यते॥३॥**

 For a Sage who is seeking Yoga, action is called the means; for the same Sage, when he is enthroned in yoga, serenity is called the means.(3)

**यदा हि नेन्द्रियार्थेषु न कर्मस्वनुषज्जते।  
सर्वसङ्कल्पसंन्यासी योगारूढस्तदोच्यते॥४॥**

 When a man feeleth no attachment either for the objects of sense or for actions, renouncing the formative will[^128]then, he is said to be enthroned in yoga.(4)

[^128]: "Sankalpa."

**उद्धरेदात्मनाऽऽत्मानं नात्मानमवसादयेत्।  
आत्मैव ह्यात्मनो बन्धुरात्मैव रिपुरात्मनः॥५॥**

 Let him raise the self by the SELF and not let the self become depressed; for verily is the SELF the friend of the self, and also the SELF the self's enemy ; (5)

**बन्धुरात्माऽऽत्मनस्तस्य येनात्मैवात्मना जितः।  
अनात्मनस्तु शत्रुत्वे वर्तेतात्मैव शत्रुवत्॥६॥**

 The SELF is the friend of the self of him in Whom the self by the SELF is vanquished; but to he unsubdued self[^129] the SELF verily becometh \*ostile as an enemy. (6)

[^129]: "* Literally, the non-self."

**जितात्मनः प्रशान्तस्य परमात्मा समाहितः।  
शीतोष्णसुखदुःखेषु तथा मानापमानयोः॥७॥**

 The higher Self of him who is SELF-controlled and peaceful is uniform in cold and heat, pleasure and pain, as well as in honour and dishonour. (7)

**ज्ञानविज्ञानतृप्तात्मा कूटस्थो विजितेन्द्रियः।  
युक्त इत्युच्यते योगी समलोष्टाश्मकाञ्चनः॥८॥**

 The Yogî[^130]who is satisfied with wisdom and knowledge, unwavering[^131]whose senses are sub-

[^130]: "+ The word Yogi is used for any one who is practising yoga, as well as for the man who has attained union."

[^131]: "+ Literally, rock-seated."

dued, to whom a lump of earth, a stone and gold are the same, is said to be harmonised.(8)

**सुहृन्मित्रार्युदासीनमध्यस्थद्वेष्यबन्धुषु।  
साधुष्वपि च पापेषु समबुद्धिर्विशिष्यते॥९॥**

 He who regards impartially lovers, friends, and foes, strangers, neutrals, foreigners and relatives, also the righteous and unrighteous, he excelleth.(9)

**योगी युञ्जीत सततमात्मानं रहसि स्थितः।  
एकाकी यतचित्तात्मा निराशीरपरिग्रहः॥१०॥**

 Let the Yogî constantly engage himself in yoga, remaining in a secret place by himself, with thought and self subdued, free from hope and greed.(10)

**शुचौ देशे प्रतिष्ठाप्य स्थिरमासनमात्मनः।  
नात्युच्छ्रितं नातिनीचं चेलाजिनकुशोत्तरम्॥११॥**

 In a pure place, established on a fixed seat of his own, neither very much raised nor very low,

made of a cloth, a black antelope skin, and kusha ; grass, one over the other ;(11)

**तत्रैकाग्रं मनः कृत्वा यतचित्तेन्द्रियक्रियः।  
उपविश्यासने युञ्ज्याद्योगमात्मविशुद्धये॥१२॥**

 There, having made the mind \*[^82] one-pointed, with thought and the functions of the senses subdued, steady on his seat, he should practise yoga for the purification of the self.(12)

**समं कायशिरोग्रीवं धारयन्नचलं स्थिरः।  
संप्रेक्ष्य नासिकाग्रं स्वं दिशश्चानवलोकयन्॥१३॥**

 Holding the body, head and neck erect, im-movably steady, looking fixedly at the point of the nose, with unseeing gaze,(13)

**प्रशान्तात्मा विगतभीर्ब्रह्मचारिव्रते स्थितः।  
मनः संयम्य मच्चित्तो युक्त आसीत मत्परः ॥१४॥**

 The self serene, fearless, firm in the vow of the

Brahmachâri[^133]the mind controlled, thinking on Me, harmonised, let him sit aspiring after in Me. (14)

[^133]: "A Brahmachâri, is a man who is keeping vow of continence a celibate.*"

**युञ्जन्नेवं सदाऽऽत्मानं योगी नियतमानसः।  
शान्ति निर्वाणपरमां मत्संस्थामधिगच्छति॥१५॥**

 The Yogî ever united thus with the SELF, with the mind[^134]controlled, goeth to Peace, to the SE supreme Bliss[^135]that abideth in Me.(15)

[^134]: "manah"

[^135]: " Nirvana"

**नात्यश्नतस्तु योगोऽस्ति न चैकान्तमनश्नतः।  
न चातिस्वप्रशीलस्य जाग्रतो नैव चार्जुन॥१६॥**

 Verily yoga is not for him who eateth too much, nor who abstaineth to excess, nor who is too much addicted to sleep, nor even to wakeful-ness, O Arjuna,(16)

**युक्ताहारविहारस्य युक्तचेष्टस्य कर्मसु।  
युक्तस्वप्नावबोधस्य योगो भवति दुःखहा॥१७॥**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

\* A Brahmachâri, is a man who is keeping vow of continence a celibate.

 Yoga killeth out all pain for him who is regulated in eating and amusement, regulated in performing actions, regulated in sleeping and waking.(17)

**यदा विनियतं चित्तमात्मन्येवावतिष्ठते।  
निःस्पृहः सर्वकामेभ्यो युक्त इत्युच्यते तदा॥१८॥**

 When his subdued thought is fixed on the SELF, free from longing after all desirable things, then it is said, "he is harmonised."(18)

**यथादीपोनिवातस्थोनेङ्गते सोपमा स्मृता।  
योगिनो यतचित्तस्य युञ्जतो योगमात्मनः॥१९॥**

 As a lamp in a windless' place flickereth not, to such is likened the Yogi of subdued thought, absorbed in the yoga of the SELF.(19)

**यत्रोपरमते चित्तं निरुद्धं योगसेवया।  
यत्र चैवात्मनाऽऽत्मानं पश्यन्नात्मनि तुष्यति॥२०॥**

 That in which the mind finds rest, quieted by the practice of yoga that in which he, seeing the SELF by the SELF, in the SELF is satisfied; (20)

**सुखमात्यन्तिकं यत्तद् बुद्धिग्राह्यमतीन्द्रियम्।  
वेत्ति यत्र न चैवाऽयं स्थितश्चलति तत्त्वतः॥२१॥**

 That in which he findeth the supreme delight which the Reason[^79]can grasp beyond the senses, wherein established he moveth not from the Reality ; (21)

**यं लब्ध्वा चापरं लाभं मन्यते नाधिकं ततः।  
यस्मिन्स्थितो न दुःखेन गुरुणाऽपि विचाल्यते॥२२॥**

 Which, having obtained, he thinketh there is no greater gain beyond it; wherein, established, he is not shaken even by heavy sorrow;(22)

**तं विद्याद् दुःखसंयोगवियोगं योगसंज्ञितम्।  
स निश्चयेन योक्तव्यो योगोऽनिर्विण्णचेतसा॥२३॥**

 That should be known by the name of yoga, this disconnection from the union with pain. This yoga must be clung to with a firm conviction and with undesponding mind[^137].(23)

[^137]: "chetah"

**सङ्कल्पप्रभावान्कामांस्त्यक्त्वा सर्वानशेषतः।  
मनसैवेन्द्रियग्रामं विनियम्य समन्ततः॥२४॥**

 Abandoning without reserve all desires born of the imagination[^138]by the mind[^139]curbing in the aggregate of the senses on every side, (24)

[^138]: "*Sankalpa."

[^139]: " Manah"

**शनैः शनैरुपरमेद् बुद्ध्या धृतिगृहीतया।  
आत्मसंस्थं मनः कृत्वा न किञ्चिदपि चिन्तयेत्॥१५॥**

 Little by little let him gain tranquillity, by means of Reason[^140]controlled by steadiness; having made the mind[^139] abide in the SELF, let him not think of anything.(25)

[^140]: "Buddhi"

**यतो यतो निश्चरति मनश्चञ्चलमस्थिरम्।  
ततस्ततो नियम्यैतदात्मन्येव वशं नयेत्॥२६॥**

 As often as the wavering and unsteady mind[^139]goeth forth, so often reining it in, let him bring it under the control of the SELF.(26)

**प्रशान्तमनसं ह्येनं योगिनं सुखमुत्तमम्।  
उपैति शान्तरजसं ब्रह्मभूतमकल्मषम्॥२७॥ **

 Supreme joy is for this Yogi whose mind[^139]is

peaceful, whose passion-nature is calmed, who is sinless and of the nature of the ETERNAL.(27)

**युञ्जन्नेवं सदा ऽऽत्मानं योगी विगतकल्मषः।  
सुखेन ब्रह्मसंस्पर्शमत्यन्तंसुखमश्नुते॥२८॥**

 The Yogîwho thus, ever harmonising the self, hath put away sin, he easily enjoyeth the infinite bliss of contact with the ETERNAL.(28)

**सर्वभूतस्थमात्मानं सर्वभूतानि चात्मनि।  
ईक्षते योगयुक्तात्मा सर्वत्र समदर्शनः॥२९॥**

 The self, harmonised by yoga, seeth the SELF abiding in all beings, all beings in the SELE ;(29) everywhere he seeth the same.

**यो मां पश्यति सर्वत्र सर्वंच मयि पश्यति।  
तस्याहं न प्रणश्यामि स च मे न प्रणश्यति॥३०॥**

 He who seeth Me everywhere, and seeth every-thing in Me, of him will I never lose hold, and he shall never lose hold of Me, (30)

**सर्वभूतस्थितं यो मां भजत्येकत्वमास्थितः।  
सर्वथा वर्त्तमानोऽपि स योगी मयि वर्तते॥३१॥**

 He who, established in unity, worshippeth Me abiding in all beings, that Yogi liveth in Me, whatever his mode of living.(31)

**आत्मौपम्येन सर्वत्र समं पश्यति योऽर्जुन।  
सुखं वा यदि वा दुःखं स योगी परमो मतः॥३२॥**

 He who, through the likeness of the SELF \*,[^144] 0 Arjuna, seeth equality in everything, whether pleas ant or painful, he is considered a perfect Yogî.(32)

[^144]: "The same SELF shining in the heart of each,"

**अर्जुन उवाच।**

**योऽयं योगस्त्वया प्रोक्तः साम्येन मधुसूदन।  
एतस्याहं न पश्यामि चञ्जलत्वात्स्थितिं स्थिराम्॥३३॥**

 This yoga which Thou hast declared to be by equanimity, O Madhusûdana, I see not a stable foundation for it, owing to restlessness;(33)

**चञ्चलं हि मनः कृष्ण प्रमाथि बलवद् दृढम्।  
तस्याऽहं निग्रहं मन्ये वायोरिव सुदुष्करम्॥३४॥**

 For the mind \*[^82] is verily restless, O Krishna ; it is impetuous, strong and difficult to bend, I deem it as hard to curb as the wind.(34)

**श्रीभगवानुवाच।**

**असंशयं महाबाहो मनो दुर्निग्रहं चलम्।  
अभ्यासेन तु कौन्तेय वैराग्येण च गृह्यते॥३५॥**

The Blessed Lord said:

 Without doubt, O mighty-armed, the mind\*[^146] is hard to curb and restless; but it may be curbed by constant practice and by dispassion.(35)

[^146]: " Manah."

**असंयतात्मना योगो दुष्प्राप इति मे मतिः।  
वश्यात्मना तु यतता शक्योऽवाप्तुमुपायतः॥३६॥**

 Yoga is hard to attain, methinks, by a self that is uncontrolled; but by the SELF-controlled it is attainable by properly directed energy. (36)

**अर्जुन उवाच।**

**अयतिः श्रद्धयोपेतो योगाच्चलितमानसः।  
अप्राप्य योगसंसिद्धिं कां गतिं कृष्ण गच्छति॥३७॥**

Arjuna said :

 He who is unsubdued but who possesseth faith, with the mind\*[^82] wandering away from yoga, fail -ing to attain perfection in yoga, whatpath doth he tread, O Krishna?

**कच्चिन्नोभयविभ्रष्टश्छिन्नाभ्रमिवनश्यति।  
अप्रतिष्ठोमहाबाहो विमूढो ब्रह्मणः पथि॥३८॥**

 Fallen from both, is he destroyed like a rent cloud, unsteadfast, O mighty-armed, deluded in the path of the ETERNAL?

**एतं मे संशयं कृष्ण छेत्तुमर्हस्यशेषतः।  
त्वदन्यः संशयस्यास्य छेत्ता नह्युपपद्यते॥३९॥**

 Deign, O Krishna, to completely dispel this

doubt of mine; for there is none to be found save Thyself able to destroy this doubt.(39)

**श्रीभगवानुवाच।**

**पार्थ नैवेह नामुत्र विनाशस्तस्य विद्यते।  
न हि कल्याणकृत्कश्चिद्दुर्गतिं तात गच्छति॥४०॥**

The Blessed Lord said:

 O son of Prithâ, neither in this world nor in the life to come is there destruction for him; never doth any who worketh lighteousness, O beloved, tread the path of woe. (40)

**प्राप्य पुण्यकृतां लोकानुषित्वा शाश्वतीः समाः।  
शुचीनां श्रीमतां गेह योगभ्रष्टोऽभिजायते॥४१॥**

 Having attained to the worlds of the pure-doing, and having dwelt there for immemorial years, he who fell from yoga is reborn in a pure and blessed house;(41)

**अथवा योगिनामेव कुले भवति धीमताम्।  
एतद्धि दुर्लभतरं लोके जन्म यदीदृशम्॥४२॥**

 Or he may even be born into a family of wise Yogîs; but such a birth as that is most difficult to obtain in this world.(42)

**तत्र तं बुद्धिसंयोगं लभते पौर्वदेहिकम्।  
यतते च ततो भूयः संसिद्धौकुरुनन्दन॥४३॥**

ध्यानात्कर्मफलत्यागस्त्यागाच्छान्तिरनन्तरम्॥१२॥**

 Better indeed is wisdom than constant-practice ; than wisdom, meditation is better ;

कारणं गुणसङ्गोऽस्य सदसद्योनिजन्मसु॥२२॥**

 He who seeth that Matter[^263]verily performeth all actions, and that the SELF is actionless, he seeth.(30)

**यथा सर्वगतं सौक्ष्म्यादाकाशं नोपलिप्यते॥  
सर्वत्रावस्थितो देहे तथाऽऽमा नोपलिप्यते॥३३॥**

 As the omnipresent ether is not affected, by reason of its subtlety, so seated everywhere in the body the SELF is not affected.(33)

**यथाप्रकाशयत्येकः कृत्स्नं लोकमिमं रविः।  
क्षेत्रं क्षेत्री तथा कृत्स्नं प्रकाशयति भारत॥३४॥**

 As the one sun illumineth the whole earth, so the Lord of the Field illumineth the whole Field, O Bhârata.(34)

THE FIELD.**

**FOURTEENTH DISCOURSE.  
श्रीभगवानुवाच।**

**परं भूयः प्रवक्ष्यामि ज्ञानानां ज्ञानमुत्तमम्।  
यज्ज्ञात्वा मुनयः सर्वे परां सिद्धिमितो गताः॥१॥**

The Blessed Lord said:

 I will again proclaim, that supreme Wisdom,of all wisdom the best, which having known,all the Sages[^281] have gone hence to the supreme Perfection.(1)

[^281]: " Munis."

**इदं ज्ञानमुपाश्रित्य मम साधर्म्यमागताः।  
सर्गेऽपि नोपजायन्ते प्रलये न व्ययन्ति च॥२॥**

 Having taken refuge in this Wisdom and being assimilated to My own nature, they are not re-born even in the emanation of a universe, nor are disquieted in the dissolution.(2)

**मम योनिर्महद्ब्रह्मतस्मिन् गर्भं दधाम्यहम्।  
सम्भवः सर्वभूतानां ततो भवति भारत॥३॥**

 My womb is the great ETERNAL; in that I place the germ; thence cometh the birth of all beings,O Bhârata.(3)

**सर्वयोनिषु कौन्तेय मूर्तयः संभवन्ति याः।  
तासां ब्रह्म महद्योनिरहं बीजप्रदः पिता॥४॥**

 In whatsoever wombs mortals are produced, O Kauntera, the great ETERNAL is their womb, I their generating father.(4)

**सत्त्वं रजस्तम इति गुणाः प्रकृतिसंभवाः।  
निबध्नन्ति महाबाहो देहे देहिनमव्ययम्॥५॥**

 Harmony,[^282]Motion, Inertia, such are thequalities[^283], Matter[^284]born; they bind fast in the body, O great-armed one, the indestructible dweller in the body.(5)

[^282]: "*More strictly Rhythm."

[^283]: " Gunas. "

[^284]: "Prakriti,"

**तत्र सत्त्वं निर्मलत्वात्प्रकाशकमनामयम्।  
सुखसङ्गेन बध्नाति ज्ञानसङ्गेन चानघ॥६॥**

 Of these Harmonyfrom its stainlessness,

luminous and healthy, bindeth by the attachment to bliss and the attachment to wisdom, O sinless one.(6)

**रजो रागात्मकं विद्धि तृष्णासङ्गसमुद्भवम्।  
तन्निबध्नाति कौन्तेय कर्मसङ्गेन देहिनम्॥७॥**

 Motion, the passion nature, know thou, is the source of attachment and thirst for life, O Kaunteya, that bindeth the dweller in the body by the attachment to action.(7)

**तमस्त्वज्ञानजं विद्धि मोहनं सर्वदेहिनाम्।  
प्रमादालस्यनिद्राभिस्तन्निबध्नाति भारत॥८॥**

 But Inertia, know thou, born of unwisdom, is the deluder of all dwellers in the body; that bindeth by heedlessness, indolence and sloth, O Bharata.(8)

**सत्त्वं सुखे सञ्जयति रजः कर्मणि भारत।  
ज्ञानमावृत्य तु तमः प्रमादे सञ्जयत्युत॥९॥**

 Harmony attacheth to bliss, Motion to action

O Bharata. Inertia, verily, having shrouded wisdom, attacheth on the contrary to heedlessness.(9)

**रजस्तमश्चाभिभूय सत्त्वं भवति भारत।  
रजः सत्त्वं तमश्चैव तमः सत्त्वं रजस्तथा॥१०॥**

 Now Harmony prevaileth, having overpowered Motion and Inertia, O Bhârata ; now Motion, having overpowered Harmony and Inertia; and now Inertia, having overpowered Harmony and Motion.(10)

**सर्वद्वारेषु देहेऽस्मिन्प्रकाश उपजायते।  
ज्ञानं यदा तदा विद्याद्विवृद्धं सत्त्वमित्युत॥११॥**

 When the wisdom-light streameth forth from all the gates of the body, then it may be known that Harmony is increasing.(11)

**लोभः प्रवृत्तिरारंभः कर्मणामशमः स्पृहा।  
रजस्येतानि जायन्ते विवृद्धे भरतर्षभ॥१२॥**

** **Greed, outgoing energy, undertaking of actions,

restlessness, desire—these are born of the increase of Motion, O best of the Bhâratas.(12)

**अप्रकाशोऽप्रवृत्तिश्च प्रमादो मोह एव च।  
तमस्येतानि जायन्ते विवृद्धे कुरुनन्दन॥१३॥**

 Darkness, stagnation and heedlessness and also delusion—these are born of the increase of Inertia, O joy of the Kurus.(13)

**यदा सत्त्वे प्रवृद्धे तु प्रलयं याति देहभृत्।  
तदोत्तमविदां लोकानमलान्प्रतिपद्यते॥१४॥**

 If Harmony verily prevaileth when the embodied goeth to dissolution, then he goeth forth to the spotless worlds of the great Sages.(14)

**रजति प्रलयं गत्वा कर्मसङ्गिषु जायते।  
तथा प्रलीनस्तमसि मूढयोनिषु जायते॥१५॥**

 Having gone to dissolution in Motion, he is born among those attached to action; if dissolved in Inertia, he is born in the wombs of the sense-less.(15)

**कर्मणः सुकृतस्याहुः सात्त्विकं निर्मलं फलम्।  
रजसस्तु फलं दुःखमज्ञानं तमसः फलम्॥१६॥**

 It is said the fruit of a good action is harmonious and spotless; verily the fruit of Motion is pain, and the fruit of Inertia unwisdom (16)

**सत्त्वात्सञ्जायते ज्ञानं रजसो लोभ एव च।  
प्रमादमोहौ तमसो भवतोऽज्ञानमेव च॥१७॥**

 From Harmony wisdom is born, and also greed from Motion; heedlessness and delusion are ofInertia and also unwisdom.(17)

**ऊर्ध्वं गच्छन्ति सत्त्वस्था मध्ये तिष्ठन्ति राजसाः।  
जघन्यगुणवृत्तिस्था अधो गच्छन्ति तामसाः॥१८॥**

 They rise upwards who are settled in Harmony; the Active dwell in the mid-most place : the Inert go downwards, enveloped in the vilest(18)

**नान्यं गुणेभ्यः कर्तारं यदा द्रष्टाऽनुपश्यति।  
गुणेभ्यश्च परं वेत्ति मद्भात्रं सोऽधिगच्छति॥१९॥!**

 When the Seer perceiveth no agent other than the qualities[^277], and knoweth THAT which is higher than the qualities,[^277] he entereth into My Nature;(19)

**गुणानेतानतीत्य त्रीन्देही देहसमुद्भवान्।  
जन्ममृत्युजरादुःखैर्विमुक्तोऽमृतमश्नुते॥२०॥**

 When the dweller in the body hath crossed over these three qualities,[^277]whence all bodies have been produced, liberated from birth, death, old age and sorrow, he drinketh the nectar ofimmortality.[^288] (20)

[^288]: "The Amrita."

**अर्जुन उवाच।**

**कैर्लिङ्गैस्त्रीन्गुणानेतानतीतो भवति प्रभो।  
किमाचारः कथं चैतांस्त्रीन्गुणानतिवर्तते॥२१॥**

**Arjuna said:**

 What are the marks of him who hath crossed over the three qualities[^289], O Lord? How acteth he, and how doth he go beyond these three qualities[^289]? (21)

[^289]: " Gunas."

**श्रीभगवानुवाच।**

**प्रकाशं च प्रवृत्तिं च मोहमेव च पाण्डव।  
न द्वेष्टि संप्रवृत्तानि न निवृत्तानि काङ्क्षति॥२२॥**

**The Blessed Lord said:**

 He, O Pândava, who hateth not radiance, nor outgoing energy, nor even delusion, when present,nor longeth after them, absent ;(22)

**उदासीनवदासीनो गुणैर्यो न विचाल्यते।  
गुणा वर्तन्त इत्येव योऽवतिष्ठति नेङ्गते॥२३॥**

 He who, seated as a neutral, is unshaken by the qualities[^289]; who, saying, “ The qualities[^289]
revolve,”standeth apart immovable.(23)

**समदुःखसुखः स्वस्थः समलोष्टाश्मकाञ्चनः।  
तुल्यप्रियाप्रियो धीरस्तुल्यनिन्दात्मसंस्तुतिः॥२४॥**

 Balanced in pleasure and pain, self-reliant, to whom a lump of earth, a rock and gold are alike, the same to loved and unloved, firm, the same in censure and in praise,(24)

**मानापमानयोस्तुल्यस्तुल्यो मित्रारिपक्षयोः।  
सर्वारंभपरित्यागी गुणातीतः स उच्यते॥२५॥**

 The same in honour and ignominy, the same to friend and foe, abandoning all under-takings he is said to have crossed over the qualities[^289]25)

**मां च योऽव्यभिचारेण भक्तियोगेन सेवते।  
स गुणान्समतीत्यैतान् ब्रह्मभूयाय कल्पते॥२६॥**

 And he who serveth Me exclusively by the Yoga of devotion, he, crossing beyond the qualities,[^289]he is fit to become the ETERNAL (26)

**ब्रह्मणो हि प्रतिष्ठाऽहममृतस्याव्ययस्य च।  
शाश्वतस्य च धर्मस्य सुखस्यैकान्तिकस्य च॥२७॥**

 For I am the abode of the ETERNAL, and of the indestructible nectar of immortality, of immemorial righteousness,[^295]and of unending bliss.(27)

[^295]: "Dharma,"

**इति श्रीमद्भगवद्गीता०गुणत्रयविभागयोगो नाम चतुर्दशोऽध्यायः।**

 Thus in the glorious Upanishads of the BHAGAVAD-GITA, the science of the ETERNAL, the scripture of Yoga, the dialogue between Shri Krishna and Arjuna, the fourteenth discourse entitled:

**THE YOGA OF SEPARATION FROM  
THE THREE QUALITIES.**

**श्रीभगवानुवाच।**

**ऊर्ध्वमूलमधः शाखमश्वत्थं प्राहुरव्ययम्।  
छन्दांसि यस्य पर्णानि यस्तं वेद स वेदवित्॥१॥**

**The Blessed Lord said:**

 With roots above, branches below, the Asvattha is said to be indestructible; the leaves of it are hymns; he who knoweth it is a Vedaknower.(1)

**अधश्चोर्ध्वं प्रसृतास्तस्य शाखाः  
गुणप्रवृद्धा विषयप्रवालाः।  
अधश्च मूलान्यनुसन्ततानि  
कर्मानुबन्धीनि मनुष्यलोके॥२॥**

 Downwards and upwards spread the branches of it, nourished by the qualities[^277]; the objects of the senses its buds; and its roots grow

downwards, the bonds of action in the world of men.(2)

**न रूपमस्येह तथोपलभ्यते  
नान्तो न चादिर्न च संप्रतिष्ठा।  
अश्वत्थमेनं सुविरूढमूल-  
मसङ्गशस्त्रेण दृढेन छित्त्वा॥३॥**

** **Nor here may be acquired knowledge of its form, nor its end, nor its origin, nor its rooting- place; this strongly rooted Asvattha having been cut down by the unswerving weapon of nonattachment,(3)

**ततः पदं तत्परिमार्गितव्यम्  
यस्मिन्गता न निवर्तन्ति भूयः।  
तमेव चाद्यं पुरुषं प्रपद्ये  
यतः प्रवृत्तिः प्रसृता पुराणी॥४॥**

** **That path beyond may be sought, treading which there is no return. I go indeed to that

Primal Man[^297] , whence the ancient energy forth-streamed.(4)

[^297]: "Purusha."

**निर्मानमोहा जितसङ्गदोषाः  
अध्यात्मनित्या विनिवृत्तकामाः।  
द्वन्द्वैर्विमुक्ताः सुखदुःखसंज्ञै-  
र्गच्छन्त्यमूढाः पदमव्ययं तत्॥५॥**

 Without pride and delusion, victorious over the vice of attachment, dwelling constantly in the SELF, desire pacified, liberated from the pairs of opposites known as pleasure and pain, they tread, undeluded, that indestructible path.(5)

**न तद्भासयते सूर्यो न शशाङ्को न पावकः।  
यद्गत्वा न निवर्तन्ते तद्धाम परमं मम॥६॥**

** **Nor doth the sun lighten there, nor moon, nor fire; having gone thither they return not; that is My supreme abode. (6)

**ममैवांशो जीवलोके जीवभूतः सनातनः।  
मनःषष्ठानीन्द्रियाणि प्रकृतिस्थानि कर्षति॥७॥**

 A portion of Mine own Self, transformed in the world of life into an immortal Spirit,[^298]draweth round itself the senses of which the mind[^61]is the sixth, veiled in matter.[^263] (7)

[^298]: "Jîva, a life, individualised from the Universal Spirit."

**शरीरं यदवाप्नोति यच्चाप्युत्क्रामतीश्वरः।  
गृहीत्वैतानि संयाति वायुर्गन्धानिवाशयात्॥८॥**

 When the Lord acquireth a body and when He abandoneth it, He seizeth these[^301]and goeth with them, as the wind takes fragrances from their retreats.(8)

[^301]: "The senses and the mind."

**श्रोत्रं चक्षुः स्पर्शनं च रसनं घ्राणमेव च।  
अधिष्ठाय मनश्चायं विषयानुपसेवते॥९॥**

 Eashrined in the ear, the eye, the touch, the taste and the smell, and in the mind[^61]also, He enjoyeth the objects of the senses (9)

**उत्क्रामन्तं स्थितं वापि भुञ्जानं वा गुणान्वितम्।  
विमूढा नानुपश्यन्ति पश्यन्ति ज्ञानचक्षुषः॥१०॥**

 The deluded do not perceive (Him) when He departeth or stayeth or enjoyeth, swayed by thequalities[^303]; the wisdom-eyed perceive.(10)

[^303]: "*Gunas."

**यतन्तो योगिनश्चैनं पश्यन्त्यात्मन्यवस्थितम्।  
यतन्तोऽप्यकृतात्मानो नैनं पश्यन्त्यचेतसः॥११॥**

 Yogîs also, struggling, perceive Him, established in the SELF ; but though struggling, the unintelligent perceive Him not, their selves untrained.(11)

**यदादित्यगत तेजो जगद्भासयतेऽखिलम्।  
यच्चन्द्रमसि यच्चाग्नौ तत्तेजो विद्धि मामकम्॥१२॥**

 That splendour issuing from the sun that enlighteneth the whole world, that which is in the moon and in fire, that splendour know as from Me.(12)

**गामाविश्य च भूतानि धारयाम्यहमोजसा।  
पुष्णामि चौषधीः सर्वाः सोमो भूत्वा रसात्मकः॥१३॥**

 Permeating the soil, I support beings by my vital energy, and having become the delicious Soma[^374] I nourish all plants.(13)

[^374]: #

**अहं वैश्वानरो भृत्वा प्राणिनां देहमाश्रितः।  
प्राणापानसमायुक्तः पचाम्यन्नं चतुर्विध॥१४॥**

 I, having become the Fire of Life[^304],take possession of the bodies of breathing things, and united with the life-breaths[^305], I digest the four kinds of food.(14)

[^304]: " + Vaisvânara,"

[^305]: "Prâna and Apâna."

**सर्वस्य चाहं हृदि सन्निविष्टो  
मत्तः स्मृतिर्ज्ञानमपोहनं च।  
वेदैश्च सर्वैरहमेव वेद्यो  
वेदान्तकृद्वेदविदेव चाहम्॥१५॥**

 And I am seated in the hearts of all, and from Me memory and wisdom and their absence. And that which is to be known in all the Vedas am I ; and I indeed the Veda-knower and the author of the Vedanta.(15)

**द्वाविमौ पुरुषौ लोके क्षरश्चाक्षर एव च।  
क्षरः सर्वाणि भूतानि कूटस्थोऽक्षर उच्यते॥१६॥**

 There are two Energies[^306]in this world, the destructible and the indestructible; the destructible is all beings, the unchanging is called the indestructible.(16)

[^306]: " Purusha."

**उत्तमः पुरुषस्त्वन्यः परमात्मेत्युदाहृतः।  
यो लोकत्रयमाविश्य बिभर्त्यव्यय ईश्वरः॥१७॥**

** **The highest Energy[^306]is verily Another, declared as the Supreme SELF, He who, pervading all, sustaineth the three worlds, the indestructible Lord.(17)

**यस्मात्क्षरमतीतोऽहमक्षरादपि चोत्तमः।  
अतोऽस्मि लोके वेदे च प्रथितः पुरुषोत्तमः॥१८॥**

 Since I excel the destructible, and am more excellent also than the indestructible, in the world and in the Veda I am proclaimed the Supreme Spirit.[^308] (18)

[^308]: "Purushottama, the highest Purusha."

**यो मामेवमसंमूढो जानाति पुरुषोत्तमम्।  
स सर्वविद्भजति मां सर्वभावेन भारत॥१९॥**

 He who undeluded knoweth Me thus as the Supreme Spirit,[^308] he, all-knowing, worshippeth Me with his whole being, O Bhârata.(19)

**इति गुह्यतमं शास्त्रमिदमुक्तं मयाऽनघ।  
एतद्बुध्वा बुद्धिमान् स्यात्कृतकृत्यश्च भारत॥२०॥**

 Thus by Me this most secret teaching hath been told O sinless one. This known, he hath become illuminated and hath finished his work, O Bhârata.(20)

**इति श्रीमद्भगवद्गीता०पुरुषोत्तमयोगो नाम पञ्चदशोऽध्यायः।**

 Thus in the glorious Upanishads of the BHAGAVAD-GITA, the science of the ETERNAL, the scripture of Yoga, the dialogue between ShrîKrishna and Arjuna, the fifteenth discourse, entitled :

**THE YOGA OF ATTAINING THE SUPREME  
SPIRIT.**

**\_\_\_\_\_\_\_**

**SIXTEENTH DISCOURSE.**

**श्रीभगवानुवाच।**

**अभयं सत्त्वसंशुद्धिर्ज्ञानयोगव्यवस्थितिः।  
दानं दमश्च यज्ञश्च स्वाध्यायस्तप आर्जवम्॥१॥**

**The Blessed Lord said:**

 Fearlessness, cleanness of life, steadfastness in the Yoga of wisdom, almsgiving, self-restraint, and sacrifice and study of the Scriptures, austerity and straightforwardness,(1)

**अहिंसा सत्यमक्रोधस्त्यागः शान्तिरपैशुनम्।  
दया भूतेष्वलोलुप्त्व मार्दवं ह्रीरचापलम्॥२॥**

 Harmlessness, truth, absence of wrath, renunciation, peacefulness, absence of crookedness, compassion to living beings, uncovetousness, mildness, modesty, absence of fickleness, (2)

**तेजः क्षमा धृतिः शौचमद्रोहो नातिमानिता।  
भवन्ति सम्पदं दैवीमभिजातस्य भारत॥३॥**

 Vigour, forgiveness, fortitude, purity, absence of envy and pride—these are his who is born with the divine properties, O Bhârata.(3)

**दम्भो दर्पोऽभिमानश्च क्रोधः पारुष्यमेव च।  
अज्ञानं चाभिजातस्य पार्थ सम्पदमासुरीम्॥४॥**

 Hypocrisy, arrogance and conceit, wrath and also harshness and unwisdom are his who is born, O Pârtha, with demoniacal[^310]properties.(4)

[^310]: "Asuric; the Asuras were the enemies of the Suras for Gods."

**देवी सम्पद्विमोक्षाय निबन्धायासुरी मता।  
मा शुचः सम्पदं देवीमभिजातोऽसि पाण्डव॥५॥**

 The divine properties are deemed to be for liberation, the demoniacal for bondage. Grieve not, thou art born with divine properties, 0 Pândava.(5)

**द्वौ भूतसर्गौ लोकेऽस्मिन्दैव आसुर एव च।  
दैवो विस्तरशः प्रोक्त आसुरं पार्थ मे शृणु॥६॥**

 Twofold is the animal creation in this world, the divine and the demoniacal: the divine hath been described at length: hear from Me, O Pârtha, the demoniacal.(6)

**प्रवृत्तिं च निवृत्तिं च जना न विदुरासुराः।  
न शौचं नापि चाचारो न सत्यं तेषु विद्यते॥७॥**

 Demoniacal men know neither right energy nor right abstinence ; nor purity, nor even propriety, nor truth is in them,(7)

**असत्यमप्रतिष्ठं ते जगदाहुरनीश्वरम्।  
अपरस्परसंभूतं किमन्यत्कामहैतुकम्॥८॥**

 "The universe is without truth, without basis,” they say, “ without a God[^311]; brought  
about by mutual union, and caused by lust and nothing else.”(8)

[^311]: " Isvara; the ruler of a universe,"

**एतवदृष्टिमवष्टभ्य नष्टात्मानोऽल्पबुद्धयः।  
प्रभवन्त्युग्रकर्माणः क्षयाय जगतोऽहिताः॥९॥**

 Holding this view, these ruined selves of small understanding[^312], of fierce deeds, come forth as enemies for the destruction of the world.(9)

[^312]: "Buddhi,"

**काममाश्रित्य दुष्पूरं दम्भमानमदान्विताः।  
मोहाद्गृहीत्वाऽसङ्ग्राहान्प्रवर्तन्तेऽशुचिव्रताः॥१०॥**

 Surrendering themselves to insatiable desires, possessed with vanity, conceit and arrogance, holding evil ideas evil ideas through delusion, they engage in action with impure resolves.(10)

**चिन्तामपरिमेयां च प्रलयातामुपाश्रिताः।  
कामोपभोगपरमा एतावदिति निश्चिताः॥११॥**

 Giving themselves over to unmeasured thought whose end is death, regarding the gratification of desires as the highest, feeling sure that this is all, (11)

**आशापाशशतैर्बद्धाः कामक्रोधपरायणाः।  
ईहन्ते कामभोगार्थ मन्यायेनार्थसञ्चयान्॥१२॥**

 Held in bondage by a hundred ties of expectation, given over to lust and anger, they strive to obtain by unlawful means hoards of wealth for sensual enjoyments (12)

**इदमद्य मया लव्धमिमं प्राप्स्ये मनोरथम्।  
इदमस्तीदमपि मे भविष्यति पुनर्धनम्॥१३॥**

 "This to-day by me hath been won, that purpose I shall gain; this wealth is mine already, and also this shall be mine in future. (13)

**असौ मया हतः शत्रुर्हनिष्ये चापरानपि।  
ईश्वरोऽहमहं भोगी सिद्धोऽहं बलवान्सुखी॥१४॥**

 "I have slain this enemy, and others also I shall slay. I am the Lord, I am the enjoyer, I am perfect, powerful, happy ; (14)

**आढ्योऽभिजनवानस्मि कोऽन्योऽस्ति सदृशो मया।  
यक्ष्ये दास्यामि मोदिष्य इत्यज्ञानविमोहिताः॥१५॥**

 "I am wealthy, well-born; what other is there that is like unto me? I will sacrifice, I will give alms, I will rejoice." Thus deluded by unwisdom,(15)

**अनेकचित्तविभ्रान्ता मोहजालसमावृताः।  
प्रसक्ताः कामभोगेषु पतन्ति नरकेऽशुचौ॥१६॥**

 Bewildered by numerous thoughts, enmeshed in the web of delusion, addicted to the gratification of desire, they fall downwards into a foul hell. (16)

**आत्मसंभाविताः स्तब्धा धनमानमदान्विताः।  
यजन्ते नामयज्ञैस्ते दम्भेनाविधिपूर्वकम्॥१७॥**

 Self-glorifying, stubborn, filled with the pride and intoxication of wealth, they perform lip-sacrifices for ostentation, contrary to scriptural ordinance.(17)

**अहङ्कारं बलं दर्पं कामं क्रोधं च संश्रिताः।  
मामात्मपरदेहेषु प्रद्विषन्तोऽभ्यसूयकाः॥१८॥**

 Given over to egoism, power, insolence, lust and wrath, these malicious ones hate Me in the bodies of others and in their own.(18)

**ज्ञानहं द्विषतः क्रूरान्संसारेषु नराधमान्।  
क्षिपाम्यजस्रमशुभानासुरीष्येव योनिषु॥१९॥**

 These haters, evil, pitiless, vilest among men in the world, I ever throw down into demoniacal wombs.(19)

**आसुरीं योनिमापन्ना मूहा जन्मनि जन्मनि।  
मामप्राप्यैव कौन्तेय ततो यान्त्यधमां गतिम्॥२०॥**

 Cast into demoniacal wombs, deluded birth after birth, attaining not to Me, O Kaunteya, they sink into the lowest depths. (20)

**त्रिविधं नरकस्येदं द्वारं नाशनमात्मनः।  
कामः क्रोधस्तथा लोभस्तस्मादेतत्त्रयं त्यजेत्॥२१॥**

 Triple is the gate of this hell, destructive of the self—lust, wrath, and greed; therefore let man renounce these three, (21)

**एतैर्विमुक्तः कौन्तेय तमोद्वारैस्त्रिभिर्नरः।  
आचरत्यात्मनः श्रेयस्ततो याति परां गतिम्॥२२॥**

 A man liberated from these three gates of darkness, O son of Kunti, accomplisheth his own welfare, and thus reacheth the highest goal,

**यः शास्त्रविधिमुत्सृज्य वर्तते कामकारतः।  
न स सिद्धिमवाप्नोति न सुखं न परां गतिम्॥२३॥**

 He who, having cast aside the ordinances of the Scriptures, followeth the promptings of desire, attaineth not to perfection, nor happiness, nor the highest goal (23)

**तस्माच्छास्त्रं प्रमाणं ते कार्याकार्यव्यवस्थितौ।  
ज्ञात्वा शास्त्रविधानोक्तं कर्म कर्तुमिहार्हसि॥२४॥**

 Therefore let the Scriptures be thy authority, In determining what ought to be done, or what ought not to be done. Knowing what hath been

 declared by the ordinances of the Scriptures, thou oughtest to work in this world.(24)

**इति श्रीमद्भगवद्गीता०देवासुरसम्पद्विभागयोगो नाम**

**षोडशोऽध्यायः।**

** **Thus in the glorious Upanishads of the BHAGAVAD-GITA, the science of the ETERNAL, the scripture of Yoga, the dialogue between Shri Krishna and Arjuna, the sixteenth discourse, entitled:

**ये शास्त्रविधिमुत्सृज्य यजन्ते श्रद्धयान्विताः।  
तेषां निष्ठा तु का कृष्ण सत्त्वमाहो रजस्तमः॥१॥**

**Arjuna said:**

 Those that sacrifice full of faith,[^313]but casting aside the ordinances of the Scriptures, what is verily their condition, O Krishna? Is it one of Purity, Passion, or Darkness[^314]?(1)

[^313]: " Shraddha. +"

[^314]: " The three qualities, Sattva, Rajah, Tamah, are here used in their moral correspondences, and are therefore translated as Purity, Passion, and Darkness."

**श्रीभगवानुवाच।**

**त्रिविधा भवति श्रद्धा देहिनां सा स्वभावजा।  
सात्त्विकी राजसी चैव तामसी चेति तां शृणु॥२॥**

**The Blessed Lord said:**

  Threefold is by nature the inborn faith of the

embodied—pure, passionate, and dark. Hear thou of these.(2)

**सत्त्वानुरूपा सर्वस्य श्रद्धा भवति भारत।  
श्रद्धामयोऽयं पुरुषो यो यच्छ्रद्धः स एव सः॥३॥**

 The faith of each is shaped to his own nature, O Bhârata. The man consists of his faith[^315]; that which his faith is, he is even that.(3)

[^315]: "That is, the man's faith shows what is the man's character."

**यजन्ते सात्त्विका देवान्यक्षरक्षांसि राजसाः।  
प्रेतान्भूतगणांश्चान्ये यजन्ते तामसा जनाः॥४॥**

 Pure men worship the Gods; the passionate the gnomes and giants[^316]; the others, the dark folk, worship ghosts and troops of naturespirits[^317].(4)

[^316]: "Yakshas, gnomes, are the servants of the Lord of Wealth, i. e., are connected with metals; Rakshasas, giants, or Titans, are the gigantic inhabitants of Atlantis versed in magic and sorcery."

[^317]: "Pretas, ghosts, are departed men; while Bhutas, nature-spirits, are of a somewhat goblin-like type."

**अशास्त्रविहितं घोरं तृप्यन्ते ये तपो जनाः।  
दम्भाहङ्कारसंयुक्ताः कामरागबलान्विताः॥५॥**

 The men who perform severe austerities, unenjoined by the Scriptures, wedded to vanity and egoism, impelled by the force of their desires and passions,(5)

**कर्शयन्तः शरीरस्थं भूतग्राममचेतसः।  
मां चैवान्तःशरीरस्थं तान्विद्ध्यासुरनिश्चयान्॥६॥**

 Unintelligent, tormenting the aggregated elements forming the body, and Me also, seated in the inner body, know these demoniacal in their resolves.(6)

**आहारस्त्वपि सर्वस्य त्रिविधो भवति प्रियः।  
यज्ञस्तपस्तथा दानं तेषां भेदमिमं शृणु॥७॥**

 The food also which is dear to each is threefold, as also sacrifice, austerity and almsgiving. Hear thou the distinction of these.(7)

**आयुःसत्त्वबलारोग्यसुखप्रीतिविवर्धनाः।  
रस्याः स्निग्धाः स्थिरा हृद्या आहाराः सात्त्विकप्रियाः॥८॥**

 The foods that augment vitality, energy, vigour, health, joy and cheerfulness, delicious, bland, substantial and agreeable, are dear to the pure. (8)

**कट्वम्ललवणात्युष्णतीक्ष्णरूक्षविदाहिनः।  
आहारा राजसस्येष्टा दुःखशोकामयप्रदाः॥९॥**

 The passionate desire foods that are bitter, sour, saline, over-hot, pungent, dry and burning and which produce pain, grief and sickness.(9)

**यातयामं गतरसं पूति पर्युषितं च यत्।  
उच्छिष्टमपि चामेध्यं भोजनं तामसप्रियम्॥१०॥**

 That which is stale and flat, putrid and corrupt, leavings also and unclean, is the food dear to the dark.(10)

**अफलाकाङ्क्षिभिर्यज्ञो विधिदृष्टोय इज्यते।  
यष्टव्यमेवेति मनः समाधाय स सात्विकः॥११॥**

 The sacrifice which is offered by men without desire for fruit, as enjoined by the ordinances, under the firm belief that sacrifice is a duty, that is pure.(11)

**अभिसन्धाय तु फलं दम्भार्थमपि चैव यत्।  
इज्यते भरतश्रेष्ठ तं यज्ञं विद्धि राजसम्॥१२॥**

 The sacrifice offered with a view verily to fruit, and also indeed for selfglorification, O best of the Bhâratas; know thou that to be of passion.(12)

**विधिहीनमसृष्टानं मन्त्रहीनमदक्षिणम्।  
श्रद्धाविरहितं यज्ञं तामसं परिचक्षते॥१३॥**

 The sacrifice contrary to the ordinances, without distributing food, devoid of words of power[^318] and without gifts[^319], empty of faith, is said to be of darkness.(13)

[^318]: "Mantras."

[^319]: " To the officiating priests."

**देवद्विजगुरुप्राज्ञपूजनं शौचमार्जवम्।  
ब्रह्मचर्यमहिंसा च शारीरं तप उच्यते॥१४॥**

 Worship given to the Gods, to the twiceborn, to the [teachers](http://Gurus. " Gurus.")and to the wise, purity, straightforwardness, continence and harmlessness, are called the austerity of the body.(14)

**अनुद्वेगकरं वाक्यं सत्यं प्रियहितं च यत्।  
स्वाध्यायाभ्यसनं चैव वाङ्मयं तप उच्यते॥१५॥**

 Speech causing no annoyance, truthful, pleasant and beneficial, the practice of the study of the Scriptures, are called the austerity of speech.(15)

**मनःप्रसादः सौम्यत्वं मौनमात्मविनिग्रहः।  
भावसंशुद्धिरित्येतत्तपो मानसमुच्यते॥ १६॥**

 Mental happiness, equilibrium, silence, selfcontrol, purity of nature—these are called the austerity of the mind[^146].(16)

**श्रद्धया परया तप्तं तपस्तत्त्रिविधं नरैः।  
अफलाकाङ्क्षिभिर्युक्तैः सात्त्विकं परिचक्षते॥ १७॥**

 This threefold austerity, performed by men with the utmost faith, without desire for fruit, harmonised, is said to be pure.(17)

**सत्कारमान पूजार्थं तपो दम्भेन चैव यत्।  
क्रियते तदिह प्रोक्तं राजसं चलमध्रुवम्॥१८॥**

 The austerity which is practised with the object of gaining respect, honour and worship, and for ostentation, is said to be of passion, unstable and fleeting.(18)

**मूढग्राहेणात्मनो यत्पीडया क्रियते तपः।  
परस्योत्सादनार्थं वा तत्तामसमुदाहृतम्॥१९॥**

 That austerity done under a deluded under- standing, with self-torture, or with the object of destroying another, that is declared of darkness.(19)

**दातव्यमिति यद्दानं दीयतेऽनुपकारिणे।  
देशे काले च पात्रे च तद्दानं सात्त्विकं स्मृतम्॥२०॥**

 That alms given to one who does nothing in return, believing that a gift ought to be made in a fit place and time to a worthy person, that alms is accounted pure.(20)

**यत्तु प्रत्युपकारार्थं फलमुद्दिश्य वा पुनः।  
दीयते च परिक्लिष्टं तद्दानं राजसं स्मृतम्॥२१॥**

 That given with a view to receiving in return, or looking for fruit again, or grudgingly, that alms is accounted of passion.(21)

**अदेशकाले यद्दानमपात्रेभ्यश्च दीयते।  
असत्कृतमवज्ञातं तत्तामसमुदाहृतम्॥२२॥**

 That alms given at unfit place and time, and to unworthy persons, disrespectfully and contemptuously, that is declared of darkness.(22)

**ओं तत्सदिति निर्देशो ब्रह्मणस्त्रिविधः स्मृतः।  
ब्राह्मणास्तेन वेदाश्च यज्ञाश्च विहिताः पुरा॥२३॥**

 "AUM TAT SAT," this has been considered to be the threefold designation of the ETERNAL. By

that were ordained of old Brâhmanas, Vedas and sacrifices.

**तस्मादोमित्युदाहृत्य यज्ञदानतपःक्रियाः।  
प्रवर्तन्ते विधानोक्ताः सततं ब्रह्मवादिनाम्॥२४॥**

 Therefore with the pronunciation of "AUM" the acts of sacrifice, gift and austerity as laid down in the ordinances are always commenced by the knowers of the ETERNAL.(24)

**तदित्यनभिसन्धाय फलं यज्ञतपःक्रियाः।  
दानक्रियाश्च विविधाः क्रियन्ते मोक्षकाङ्क्षिभिः॥२५॥**

 With the pronunciation of "TAT" and without aiming at fruit are performed the various acts of sacrifice, austerity and gift, by those desiring liberation.(25)

**सद्भावे साधुभावे च सदित्येतत्प्रयुज्यते।  
प्रशस्ते कर्मणि तथा सच्छब्दः पार्थ युज्यते॥२६॥**

 "SAT" is used in the sense of reality and

goodness ; likewise, O Pârtha, the word " SAT "is used in the sense of a good work.(26)

**यज्ञे तपसि दाने च स्थितिः सदिति चोच्यते।  
कर्म चैव तदर्थीयं सदित्येवाभिधीयते॥२७॥**

 Steadfastness in sacrifice, austerity and gift is also called "SAT", and action for the sake of the Suprema[^321]is also named “SAT.”(27)

[^321]: "TAT,"

**अश्रद्धया हुतं दत्तं तपस्तप्तं कृतं च यत्।  
असदित्युच्यते पार्थ न च तत्प्रेत्य नो इह॥२८॥**

 Whatsoever is wrought without faith, oblation, gift, austerity, or other deed, “Asat” it  
is called, OPârtha ; it is nought, here or hereafter.(28)

**इति श्रीमद्भगवद्गीता०श्रद्धात्रयविभागयोगो नाम सप्तदशोऽध्यायः।**

**Arjuna said:**

  I desire, O mighty-armed, to know severally the essence of renunciation,[^322]O Hrishîkesha, and of relinquishment,[^323] O Keshinishûdana[^324].(1)

[^322]: "Sannyâsa,"

[^323]: "Tyâga,"

[^324]: "Slayer of Keshi, a demon."

**श्रीभगवानुवाच ।**

**काम्यानां कर्मणां न्यासं संन्यासं कवयो विदुः।  
सर्वकर्मफलत्यागं प्राहुस्त्यागं विचक्षणाः॥२॥**

**The Blessed Lord said:**

 Sages have known as renunciation the renouncing of works with desire; the relin. quishing of the fruit of all actions is called relinquishment by the wise.(2)  

**त्याज्यं दोषवदित्येकेकर्म प्राहुर्मनीषिणः।  
यज्ञदानतपः कर्म न त्याज्यमिति चापरे॥३॥**

 “ Action should be relinquished as an evil,"[^325]s declare some thoughtful men ; "acts of sacrifice, gift and austerity should not be relinquished," say others,(3)

[^325]: "Some read: "

**निश्चयं शृणु मे तत्र त्यागे भरतसत्तम।  
त्यागो हि पुरुषव्याघ्र त्रिविधः सम्प्रकीर्तितः॥४॥**

 Hear my conclusions as to that relinquishment, O best of the Bhâratas; since relinquishment, O tiger of men, has been explained as threefold. (4)

**यज्ञदानतपः कर्म न त्याज्यं कार्यमेव तत्।  
यज्ञो दानं तपश्चैव पावनानि मनीषिणाम्॥५॥**

 Acts of sacrifice, gift and austerity should not be relinquished, but should be performed;

sacrifice, gift and also austerity are the purifiers of the intelligent.(5)

**एतान्यपि तु कर्माणि सङ्गं त्यक्त्वा फलानि च।  
कर्तव्यानीति मे पार्थ निश्चितं मतमुत्तमम्॥६॥**

  But even these actions should be done leaving aside attachment and fruit, O Pârtha; that is my certain and best belief.(6)

**नियतस्य तु संन्यासः कर्मणो नोपपद्यते।  
मोहात्तस्य परित्यागस्तामसः परिकीर्तितः॥७॥**

  Verily renunciation of actions that are prescribed is not proper; the relinquishment thereof from delusion is said to be of darkness. (7)

**दुःखमित्येव यत्कर्म कायक्लेशभयात्त्यजेत्।  
स कृत्वा राजसं त्यागं नैव त्यागफलं लभेत्॥८॥**

 He who relinquisheth an action from fear of physical suffering, saying "Painful," "Painful," thus performing a passionate relinquishment, obtaineth not the fruit of relinquishment. (8)

**कार्यमित्येव यत्कर्म नियतं क्रियतेऽर्जुन।  
सङ्गं त्यक्त्वा फलं चैव स त्यागः सात्त्विको मतः॥९॥**

  He who performeth a prescribed action, saying, “ it cught to be done, " O Arjuna, relinquishing attachment and also fruit, that relinquishment is regarded as pure.(9)

**न द्वेष्ट्यकुशलं कर्म कुशलं नानुषज्जते।  
त्यागी सत्त्वसमाविष्टो मेधावी छिन्नसंशयः॥१०॥**

** **The relinquisher pervaded by purity, intelligent and with doubts cut away, hateth not unpleasurable action nor is attached to pleasurable.(10)

**न हि देहभृता शक्यं व्यक्तुं कर्माण्यशेषतः।  
यस्तु कर्मफलत्यागी स त्यागीत्यभिधीयते॥११॥**

 Nor indeed can embodied beings completely relinquish action; verily he who relinquisheth the fruit of action, he is said to be a relinquisher, (11)

**अनिष्टमिष्टं मिश्रं च त्रिविधं कर्मणः फलम्।  
भवत्यत्यागिनां प्रेत्य न तु संन्यासिनां क्वचित्॥१२॥**

 Good, evil and mixed—threefold is the fruit of action hereafter for the non-relinquisher; but there is none ever for the renouncer.(12)

**पञ्चैतानि महाबाहो कारणानि निबोध मे।  
साङ्ख्ये कृतान्ते प्रोक्तानि सिद्धये सर्वकर्मणाम्॥१३॥**

 These five causes, O mighty-armed, learn of Me as declared in the Sâñkhya system for the accomplishment of all actions:(13)

**अधिष्ठानं तथा कर्ता करणं च पृथग्विधम्।  
विविधाश्च पृथक्चेष्टा दैवं चैवात्र पञ्चमम्॥१४॥**

 The body, the actor, the various organs, the diverse kinds of energies, and the presiding deities also, the fifth.(14)

**शरीरवाङ्मनोभिर्यत्कर्म प्रारभते नरः।  
न्याय्यं वा विपरीतं वा पञ्चैते तस्य हेतवः॥१५॥**

 Whatever action a man performeth by his body, speech and mind,\*[^61] whether right or the reverse, these five are the cause thereof.(15)

**तत्रैवं सति कर्तारमात्मानं केवलं तु यः।  
पश्यत्यकृतबुद्धित्वान्न स पश्यति दुर्मतिः॥१६॥**

 That being so, he verily who-owing to untrained Reason †[^44]-looketh on his SELF, which is isolated, as the actor, he of perverted intelligence, seeth not.(16)

**यस्य नाहंकृतो भावो बुद्धिर्यस्य न लिप्यते।  
हत्वाऽपि स इमाँलोकान्न हन्ति न निबध्यते॥१७॥**

 He who is free from the egoistic notion, whose Reason[^140] is not affected, though he slay these peoples, he slayeth not, nor is bound.(17)

करणं कर्म कर्तेति त्रिविधः कर्मसङ्ग्रहः॥१८॥**

 Knowledge, the knowable and the knower,

the threefold impulse to action; the organ, the action, the actor, the threefold constituents of action.(18)

प्रोच्यन्ते गुणसङ्ख्याने यथावच्छृणु तान्यपि॥१९॥**

 Knowledge, action and actor in the category of qualities[^265]are also said to be severally threefold, from the difference of qualities[^265]; hear thou duly these also.(19)

**सर्वभूतेषु येनैकं भावमव्ययमीक्षते।  
अविभक्तं विभक्तेषु तज्ज्ञानं विद्धि सात्विकम्॥२०॥**

 That by which one indestructible Being is seen in all beings, inseparate in the separated, know thou that knowledge as pure.(20)

**पृथक्त्वेन तु यज्ज्ञानं नानाभावान्पृथग्विधान्।  
वेत्ति सर्वेषु भूतेषु तज्ज्ञानं विद्धि राजसम्॥२१॥**

  But that knowledge which regardeth the

several manifold existences in all beings as separate, that knowledge know thou as of passion ;(21)

**यत्तु कृत्स्नवदेकस्मिन् कार्ये सक्तमहैतुकम्।  
अतत्त्वार्थवदल्पं च तत्तामसमुदाहृतम्॥२२॥**

 While that which clingeth to each one thing as if it were the whole, without reason, without grasping the reality, narrow, that is declared to be dark.(22)

**नियतं सङ्गरहितमरागद्वेषतः कृतम्।  
अफलप्रेप्सुना कर्म यत्तत्सात्त्विकमुच्यते॥२३॥**

 An action which is ordained, done by one undesirous of fruit, devoid of attachment, without love or hate, that is called pure.(23)

 Liberated from attachment, not egoistic, endued with firmness and confidence, unchanged by success or failure, that actor is called pure. (26)

**रागी कर्मफलप्रेप्सुर्लुब्धो हिंसात्मकोऽशुचिः।  
हर्षशोकान्वितः कर्ता राजसः परिकीर्तितः॥२७॥**

 Impassioned, desiring to obtain the fruit of actions, greedy, harmful, impure, moved by joy and sorrow, such an actor is pronounced passionate.(27)
