 INTRODUCTORY NOTE ON SAMSKRIT GRAMMAR

* Gita Mahatmyam.*—The greatness of the Gita as described in the Varaha—Purana

* Gita-Karadi-Nyasah.*—The Tantra way of 'practising' the Gita.

* Gita—Dhyanam.*—‘The Thought—Form of the Gita for purposes of meditation

 CHAP: I. *Arjuna Vishada*-*Yoga*.—Arjuna inspects the rival forces—He describes the evil consequent on the battles of kinsfolk

 CHAP II. *Sankhya-Yoga.*—Arjuna refuses to fight—Shrî Kṛiṣhṇa counsels Arjuna not to grieve over the mere destruction of transient bodies, because the inner Self can never be slain—or even because the bodies must die in any case— and so to perform the duty of the Kṣhattriya with untroubled mind—thereby gaining fame in this and happiness in the other world, incidentally—though duty should be performed for its own sake and not for any ulterior reward, as it is performed by sages of steady mind—Arjuna asks for a more particular description of such—Shrî Kṛiṣhṇa complies, laying stress on the attainment of wisdom and the absence of desire.



 CHAP: III. *Karma-Yoga.*—Arjuna asks how these are compatible with such terrible action as that of slaughter-Shrî Kṛiṣhṇa’s preliminary reconciliation of the two: “perform the action that is duty, but without attachment”—a cursory allusion to the system of the world-wheel, which gives rise to the various Dharmas, duties—Arjuna enquires why men fail in duty—Shrî Kṛiṣhṇa replies, cursorily as yet.

 CHAP: IV.... *Jnana-Vibhaga-Yoga*—Shrî Kṛiṣhṇa again lays stress on the necessity of Wisdom, right-thought, right-reason, and in this connection describes the many forms of Yoga—He adverts to His own previous incarnations, in reply to a question of Arjuna's (and so incidentally strengthens the allusion, made before, to world-cycles, without an understanding of which true enlightenment is not possible).

 CHAP V. *Karma-Sannyasa-Yoga*.—Arjuna repeats his question as to the inconsistency between 'renunciation' and 'action'—Shrî Kṛiṣhṇa answers (indirectly, by describing the happy condition of ... those who renounce the fruits of action but continue to perform it as duty, knowing that all proceeds from the Supreme Self,

 CHAP VI. *Adhyatma-Yoga.*—Shrî Kṛiṣhṇa continues his description of the Yogi—Arjuna asks how the condition may be attained—Shrî Kṛiṣhṇa



answers: “by dispassion and perseverent practice.”—Arjuna asks: “what are the consequences of failure in Yoga?“—Shrî Kṛiṣhṇa replies: “a better birth, greater opportunity and devotion to the Supreme Self, and final attainment of Moksha.”

  **CHAP: VII. *Jnana-Yoga.***—Shrî Kṛiṣhṇa describes the natures of wisdom and unwisdom—the Glories of the Self (the knowledge of which constitutes the wisdom whereby the possessor thereof performs his duty unflinchingly).

 **CHAP: VIII. *Akshara-Brahma-Yoga.***—(The subjectmatter of the previous chapter is continued.) Arjuna asks what is the nature of Brahman, of Adhyâtma, Adhibhûta, and Adhidaiva-Shrî Kṛiṣhṇa describes these and also incidentally ora mentions how Brahman may be reached by the byliving as well as the departing Jîva.

 **CHAP: IX.*****Raja-Vidya-Raja-Guhya-Yoga.***—Shrî Kṛiṣhṇa continues his statement of “the Royal Secret, the final wisdom,” the possession of which confers Immortality, viz, the recognition of and devotion to the Supreme Self—also describes the results of devotion to minor personal Gods (Îshvaras of systems &c.)

 **CHAP: X. *Vibhuti - Yoga.***—The Glories of the Supreme Self

 **CHAP: XI. V*ishvarupa-darshana-Yoga.***—Shrî Kṛiṣhṇa compresses into one illuminating vision all the



results of lengthened explanations, and makes Arjuna see directly that he and all his fellow- beings are part of the life of Îshvara-that they are what they are by His gift (in the personal aspect of the Supreme Self, manifesting as an Individual Îshvara) that it is their duty to endeavour, feebly as they may, to repay this great debt by obeying His will, and that His will, in the present instance is the destruction of Kṣhattriyas.

** CHAP: XII. *Bhakti-Yoga*.**—Arjuna, perceiving the difference between the Unmanifested Eternal and the manifested Îshvara, incidentally asks which is the better method, fixing the mind on the one or on the other-Shrî Kṛiṣhṇa answers: “the former is the more difficult, and by that method too, Jîvas have to pass to the stage and state of (a personal) Îshvara.” (He thereby stimulates deeper enquiry, to which He leaves the discovery that the two systems are really not distinct, that the one system is to fix the mind on the Eternal, and, in subordination to that supreme fact, to work by the will of the Îshvara to whom we belong.

 **CHAP: XIII. *Kshetra-Kshetrajna-vibhaga-Yoga.***—Shrî Kṛiṣhṇa expounds the difference between Puruṣha and Prakṛiti as part of the supreme science, the wisdom which raises the Jîva above doubt and makes him steady in action as Arjuna should be.



** CHAP: XIV. *Guna-traya-vibhaga-Yoga.***—The subject of the preceding chapter is continued and ion the three guṇas of Prakriti are dealt with.

 **CHAP : XV. *Purushottama-Yoga***.—Shrî Kṛiṣhṇa carries on the subject of the 13th discourse, and deals specially with the Puruṣha, in the aspect of the Abstract Self as well as the aspect of a manifested Îshvara.

** CHAP: XVI. *Daivasura-Sampad-vibhaga-Yoga.***— Shrî Kṛiṣhṇa goes on to describe, as another essential part of the highest science, and having, further, an immediate bearing on the issue before Arjuna, the dual nature of all the creatures of Îshvara, divine and demoniac, good and evil—He tells how the former class, to which Arjuna belongs, necessarily perform their duty, in accordance with the Shâstras (and battle against the latter to prevent them from harming the innocent).

** CHAP: XVII. *Shraddha-traya-vibhaga-Yoga***.—Arjuna asks Shrî Kṛiṣhṇa to describe what is the essence of all true action and what is not, also what characterises all untrue action, according as the predominant motive-nature is Sâttvika, Râjasa, or tâmasa.

** CHAP: XVIII*. Sannyasa-Yoga*.**—Shrî Kṛiṣhṇa sums up, finally, the whole teaching regarding the combination of renunciation of fruit of action with performance, which is the only means of secur-



ing ultimate happiness—Arjuna's doubts are solved; he is convinced and satisfied, and expresses his readiness to do his duty of battling with the unrighteous.

INTRODUCTION.

 T

HIS edition of the *Bhagavad-Gîtâ* has been prepared for the use of those who, while studying this Hindu scripture mainly for the sake of its priceless teachings, wish, being little acquainted with Samskṛit, to utilise the text, thus gaining a fuller insight into the meaning than can be gained through a translation, and incidentally acquiring a better knowledge of that language also. A brief note on the grammar of Samskrit, putting before the reader afew of the most salient features thereof, is therefore added here, as likely to be of use. It will help by giving a bird’s eye view of the subject and thus some idea of how one part is connected with another. The details must of course be looked up in any large grammar, if needed.

 *I. Alphabet:*—A complete alphabet would comprise hundreds, perhaps thousands, of single sounds. Out of these each human race or sub-race uses a comparatively small number, selected in accordance with the constitution of its vocal organs and of other aspects of its physical and superphysical being. There is a correspondence between all the parts of an organism; and the means and instruments of manifestation possessed by a race or nation, as by an individual, are, generally speaking, in correspondence with the ‘ruling passion,’ the ‘main idea,’ which that race or nation embodies and has to express. These ‘ideas,’ ‘passions,’ ‘emotions,’ ‘glories,’ ‘aspects,’ ‘modifications,’





of the Universal Self, Spirit, or Consciousness, are infinite; the world-process which endeavours to express them is infinite. One main idea (others being subordinate) is expressed by one individual, or one race, in any one time and space, ‘beauty’, ‘strength,’ ’comfort’, ‘peace,’ ‘war’, ‘science,’ ‘law’, ‘duty’ ‘right,’ ‘piety,’ ‘devotion,’ &c. &c. The various members of a race, which is the embodiment and exponent of any one such main idea, have to use means of communication with each other to intensify that exposition, to make their lives fuller and deeper. This means, during the present cycle of evolution, is sound-language. In other cycles it may be sight-language, or touch-language, or smell-language, &c. &c. This sound-language is made up of single sounds, which, as said before, are in accordance with the ‘body,’ the physical constitution, of the race, which, again, is in accordance with its ‘spirit,’ its ruling idea. A race embodying sweetness and gentleness would unconsciously select the soft and sweet sounds for its language; another manifesting martial strength and spirit, the harsher and more definite ones.

 The Saṃskrit language, embodying *Dharma*, law and order, the instrument of a civilisation whose characteristics are systematisation, rounded comprehensiveness and completeness, an ordered arrangement of life from beginning to end, and in all departments, is therefore itself systematic. It uses fourteen vowels and thirty-five consonants, a total of seven sevens. Some put the nasal and the aspirate sounds—.*anusvára* and: *visarga*—amongst the vowels, and so count them as sixteen and the consonants thirty-three. They are arranged systematically, according to the regions of the vocal apparatus whence they proceed, as gutturals, linguoe-radicals, palatals, cerebrals, dentals,



labials, and certain combinations of these—beginning from the throat and proceeding outwards. As to why we have here two septenaries of vowels and five septenaries of consonants is a question which could possibly be answered by one who had sufficient knowledge of world-evolution to be able to say why the present human race has two hands and two feet and five senses of knowledge and five organs of action, and five fingers on each hand and five toes on each foot, &c. The question can only tantalise us. But we can vaguely see that if these sounds of the Saṃskrit alphabet were multiplied systematically and permuted and combined, we should obtain a scheme which would cover all the languages of the earth, and bring into line all the very various-seeming sounds which constitute the several alphabets of these. *F.i.*, taking the linguoe-radicals **क, ख, ग, घ, ङ,** we find that **ख**, is the aspirate of **क**, that the guttural of this **ख**, *viz*, **ख़**, ḵh, has been appropriated by the Persian race and language and has disappeared from Saṃskrit; that **ग**, is only a deepening of **क**; and that **घ**, is the aspirate of **ग**; that the guttural of **क** *i.e.*, q, and of , **ग** *i.e,* g̱h, again, have disappeared from Saṃskrit and been appropriated by the Arabic race and language; that **ङ़**, is the nasal of **ग**, as now pronounced, and that the nasals of the other letters, **क, ख, घ**,&c., &c., are not present in Saṃskrit, but may possibly be present in some of the so-called savage languages, as 'snorts' and 'grants' of various kinds.

 This process of elimination, of the disappearance of sounds and letters, may be witnessed as being in progress even to-day. In Saṃskrit the vowels, **ऋ, ऋृ, लृ, लृृ** have practically disappeared from use; their outer written form is preserved, but for all practical purposes of pronunciation they have merged into **र** and **ल**.



The distinction between **श** and **ष** is on the wane; the probability, judging by the rules of pronunciation given by Pâṇiṇi, is that **ष** in another form of the Persian ḵh mentioned above, as thediscarded**ᳲक** is that of the Arabic q̱ and the similarly ofabandoned **ᳲप**the Persian pḥ or f.

 The nasal letters again **ङ, ञ, ण, न,** have a tendency to run, all of them, into the single न, in the months of those who are not particularly careful. So in English, sounds which originally existed when such words as 'daughter' (Persian *duḵhtar*, Saṃskrit *duhitâ*), and 'night' (Saṃskrit *nakta*) &c. were brought over, have now disappeared except perhaps in some village dialects, though the spelling continues as before. The reason of this may be suggested thus. According to the variety of the aspects of consciousness embodied in a people will be the variety of sounds, or letters employed by them; as the one variety diminishes or expands so will the other: if the word *laugh* were pronounced as *lawg̱h* as it probably was in the beginning, and as it is still by 'uneducated' people, it would imply a greater and a somewhat coarser heartiness; pronounced as *lâf* it indicates a toning down of the uncontrolled animal spirit, into a much more mild and refined condition of feeling. In America, and in some English circles, it is becoming further shortened into *laff*.

[TABLE]



 There are only a few verses now current, as to the psychophysics of sound and language, in Pâṇini's *Shikshâ*, and these are not very intelligible in the absence of full explanations. They may be summarised thus: The Self cognising facts by means of the *Buddhi* (Reason) inspires the *Manas* (intelligence) with the desire to speak; the *Manas* strikes the *kâyâgni*-the fire of the body; and it in turn sets in motion the *mâruta*, the wind or breath that moving in the chest generates the *Mandra* sound; that, again, rising to the palate (or the crown of the head) and rebounding thence passes to the mouth and produces articulate sounds, classified according to tone, time, place, effort, &c., &c.

 *II. Sandhi or Coalescence of sounds or letters*—In connection with these letter sounds, arises the first difficulty of Saṃskrit Grammar, *Sandhi*, the coalescence of sounds. When one word is followed by another, in quick succession of pronunciation, the natural tendency is for the tail of the first and the head of the second to get mixed up: This mixture sometimes takes a shape which, while no doubt always retaining traces of the compo-



nents, is not always analysable into these components by the beginner. The coalescence takes place in all languages, and offers one of the chief difficulties to the foreigner; but in other languages, for the most part, no attempt is made to express in writing the spoken sound. Thus the Frenchman says “le'pti,” but he always writes “le petit.” In Saṃskrit writing the spoken sound is imitated. The detailed rules on this subject, which two sounds mixing make up which third sound, are many. The generalised rule may be stated to be that if the student will pronounce the two letters *correctly* and quickly in succession, the resultant sound, compelled by his own vocal apparatus, will also be in accordance with the grammatical rule on the subject. Briefly, the grammatical rule is only a description of the physiological fact. This appears not only in the case of actual coalescence, but in the influence of one sound on another separated from it by one or more intervening ones. Thus, according to the ordinary rule the word **राम** declined into its instrumental form, should be **रामेन**, but after pronouncing the cerebral *r* in its exact Saṃskrit shade, the vocal apparatus of the Indian finds it difficult to adjust itself rapidly to pronounce the dental-nasal *n***न** properly, even when another labial nasal *m* intervenes; it turns more readily to the allied and nearer cerebral-nasal ṇ, **ण**, and the result is **रामेण**.

 Examples:

 (a.) *Conjunction of similar rowels:* whether both short or both long, or one short and one long, the resultant is the long vowel.

 **कृतेन अर्थः = कृतेनार्थः**(iii. 18.), **आत्मना** आत्मानं = **आत्मनात्मानं** (vi. 5.), **च अपरे = चापरे** (iv. 27); and so with **इ, उ, ऋः, उत्क्रा-**



**मति ईश्वरः = उत्क्रामतीश्वरः** (xv. 8.), **तु उद्देशतः = तूद्देशतः** (x. 4.) etc.

 (b) *Conjunction of dissimilar vowels*: **अ** or **आ** followed by **इ**or **ई** gives **ए**, **एका इह = एकेह** (ii.41.) ; by **उ or ऊ** gives **ओ, श्रद्धया उपेतः = श्रद्धयोपेतः** (vi. 37.) ; by **ए** or **ऐ** gives **ऐ, न एवं = नैवं** (ii. 38.) ; by **ॠ** gives **अर्, देव ऋषिः** = **देवर्षिः** (ii.13.) ; by **ओ** or **औ** gives **औ**; **इ** followed by any dissimilar vowel gives **य्, गच्छन्ति अनामयं = गच्छन्त्यनामयं** (ii.57.) ; so gives **उ** and **ऋ, र्.**

** **(c) Visarga: changes in five ways; it disappears, **समवेताः युयुत्सवः = समवेता युयुत्सवः** (i.1.) ; it is dropped before a vowel and no further change occurs, **कामः एषः = काम एषः** (iii. 37.); it changes into **ष, श** and **स, दुः कृतां** = **दुष्कृतां** ( iv. 8.), **पांडवाः च = पांडवाश्च** (.1.), **यज्ञः तपः तथा = यज्ञस्तपस्तथा** (xvii. 7.) ; it changes into **ओ, यः मां = यो मां** (vi. 30.), **अजः अपि = अजोपि**(iv.6.) these cases being generally marked with ऽ. as **सः अर्जुन = सोऽर्जुन** (iv 9) \] ; it is changed into **र्, योनिः महद्ब्रह्म = योनिर्महद्ब्रह्मं** (xiv. 3.) The details of the rules causing these changes must be sought in a grammar.

 (d) *Consonants* : The final consonant of one word is modified by the first consonant of the succeeding one. These changes are very numerous and intricate, and will only gradually become familiar; the following cases show the general principle above mentioned that the writing follows the sound; **यत्****ज्ञात्वा = यज्ज्ञात्वा (vii.2.), यत् यत् विभूतिमत् = यद्यद्विभूतिमत् (x. 41.), यत् च = यच्च (x. 39.)**

 III. *Compounds*. When all cases of simple sandhi have been eliminated, the student is faced with another difficulty; words are compounded together, and only the last word of the compound is complete; the remaining word or words have their endings clipped off, and these have to be supplied before



the compound becomes intelligible. Such compounds are called **समास**. They are of six chief kinds.

 **द्वन्द्व**compounds; **रागः च द्वेषः च = रागद्वेषौ** (iii. 34.); **पणवाः च आनकाः च गोमुखाः च** = **पणवानकगोमुखाः** (i. 13.)

 **तत्पुरुष** *compounds* ; **देवानाम ईश = देवेश** (xi.45); **विस्मयेन आविष्टः** = **विस्मयाविष्टः** (xi.14.)

** कर्मधारय** *Compounds* ; **परमः आत्मा**=**परमात्मा** (xv- 17)

 **द्विगु** *Compounds* ; **त्रयाणां गुणानां समाहारः**=**त्रैगुण्यम्**(ii. 45.)

 **बहुव्रीहि** Compounds **विजितानि इंद्रियाणि यस्य सः = विजितेंद्रियः** (vi.8.); **ब्रह्मणा संस्पर्शः यस्य तत् = ब्रह्मसंस्पर्शम्** (vi. 28.)

 **अव्ययीभाव** Compounds ; **आत्मनः विषये = अध्यात्मम्।**

 To solve these compounds it will be noticed that a knowledge of case-endings is necessary; it is the case-ending which is struck out in a compound, and the meaning of the compound depends on this eliminated case-ending. Hence the next step of the learner is to familiarise himself with the case-endings, of which every noun has twenty-one-7 cases in 3 numbers, singular, dnal and plural.

 IV. *Words—*(a) Declension of nouns.Wordsare mainly oftwo kinds, names of things and names of actions, corresponding respectively to the cognition and action aspects of consciousness. Mediating between the two, binding them together, as desire binds cognition and action, is the third kind of word, the preposition; it forms a separate word in the modern languages, for various evolutionary reasons; but in the Saṃskrit, it is hidden in and is a part of the noun itself, in the shape of the declensional termination, even as desire is hidden in theperson, the actor, and is not something separate from him. Other



parts of speech are off-shoots from these three principal ones. Nouns including prononns are (i) simple, subdivided by gender into 3 classes, or (ii) derivative, i. e. to say, derived from verb-roots. Of course one theory, and probably the right one, is that all names or nouns are ultimately connected with and founded on some characteristic *action* of the object; but without going into, the detail of the theory, it is enough for practical purposes to recognise that as the Saṃskrit language now stands, some of its nouns may be regarded as, on their face, simple and some as derivative. To denote the kind of relation that exists between one noun and another, and also to give some indication of the kind of action passing between them, is the purpose of prepositional, or declensional, terminations. As *pre-positions*, distinguishing and *separating* marks of the *kinds* of the nouns concerned, showing the position or situation or case in which they are, whether nominative, or accusative, or instrumental, &c., with reference to each other, these declensional terminations are called *vibhaktis*; as indicating that some action passes between them, they are called *kârakas*.

 Examples of declensions :

1st. **सन्यासः**    \[v. 1.\]      **उभौ       **\[v. 1\]     **पंडिताः    **\[v. 4\]  
2nd. **रथं**       \[i. 21\]     **अश्विनौ    
**\[xi, 6\]    **लोकान्    ** \[xi. 32\]  
3rd**पुत्रेण      **\[i 3\]       **नराभ्याम्     
      वेदैः       **\[xi. 53\]  
4th. **विनाशाय  **\[iv. 1\]       ”           
     **पापेभ्यः**  
5th. **हस्तात्     **\[ii. 30\]       ”         
      **पापेभ्यः   **\[xviii. 66\]  
6th. **लोकस्य    **\[v. 14\]     **तयोः     
**\[iii.34\]   **पुत्राणाम्   **\[i, 3\]  
7th **मध्ये       **\[i. 21\]     **उभयोः    
**\[i. 21\]    **गुणेषु     **\[iii. 28\]



 Âtmâ, crude form Âtman, is a typical form, and occurs very frequently in the *Gitâ* in the singular number.

1st.   **आत्मा**      \[ v. 21\]  
2nd.   **आत्मानम्**   \[vi. 5\]  
3rd.   **आत्मना**    \[vi. 5\]  
4th.   **आत्मने**  
5th.   **आत्मनः**  
6th.   **आत्मनः**    \[vi. 6\]  
7th.   **आत्मनि**   \[vi. 21\]

 Neuter nouus in their case-endings, except in those of the first and second cases, generally follow the masculine.

          Thus       **कर्म**crude form **कर्मन्**, has :

     1st. **कर्म** (xviii. 8) **कर्मणी कर्माणि** ( ix. 9 )

     2nd.  ”  (iii. 8)     ”    ” (vi. 30)

 The feminine in **इ** may be taken as an example of the feminine declensions:

1st.       **मतिः**       (xviii. 78)  
2nd.       **बुद्धिं**       (iii. 2)  
3rd.       **बुद्ध्या**      (ii. 39)  
4th.       **मत्यै** or **मतये**  
5th.       **बुद्धेः**       (iii. 43) or **बुद्ध्याः**  
6th.        ”  
7th.       **बुद्धौ**       (ii, 49 )

 (b) *Adjectives and adverbs &c.* Adjectives, words indicative of the ‘qualities’ of nouns, are declined in the same way as the latter, and when not compounded with these are always in “apposition” with them.



 Adverbs are mostly ‘Indeclinable’ in Saṃskrit. These indeclinables include also some words, however, which are not *adverbs*; thus conjunctions and interjections are included here. Examples **च, अति, अतीव, अथ. अभितः, अवश्यम्, अहोबत, अहो, इति, इव, इह, उत, एव, एवम्, कच्चित् कथम्, किन्तु, कृते, चेत्, तदा, तु, न,** &c., &c., are of frequent occurrence.

 (c) *Gender*. The marks of gender are very perplexed in Saṃskrit: They belong to the noun only, as in most languages; and not the verb, as in Hindi, Arabic or French. As a general rule, governing frequent cases, when the male base ends in a short **अ**, the corresponding female base ends in the long **आ**; and the neuter in **अं.**

**अपरः**  Singularof **अपरान्  ** (xvi-14)  
**अपरा ** (iii. 6)   ;   **अपरं    **(iv- 4).

 (d) Verbs. After nouns, verbs. The list of roots given by Paṇini numbers 2343; and each is capable of undergoing hundreds of inflectional or conjugational terminations, on account of moods and tenses, and causative, desiderative and repetitive forms of it, and all these again can be conjugated in the active or the passive form, and so on.But by the same processes of selection and elimination that havegoverned the numberof the letters, the verb-roots in actual use in current Saṃskrit are not many more than 500 and of these a very limited number of forms is used.

 The tenses and moods are taken together and all called *vibhaktis* or *lakáras*; and there are ten of such, *viz*., six tenses and four moods. The tenses are, 1 present; 3 past; and 2 future; and the moods are Imperative, Potential, Benedictive and



Conditional. In common and unclassical Saṃskrit, one form of the past, *viz*., the first preterite, is largely used, the other two being very infrequent; so the first future is seldom met with even in classical Saṃskrit. Of the moods, the benedictive mood is very rarely used.

 If the whole list of the 2343 roots were carefully examined, very many more roots would be found to be common between the several Âryan languages than are now noted. But, as said before in connection with the alphabet, the genius of each later language has selected out of the roots what were most suited to it, and the older race, the root-race, has correspondingly dropped them in its later career. It is as if there had been a partition of patrimony between heirs so that what one took the others could not retain.

 These verbs are divided into ten classes; the external reason is that the verbs of each class resemble each other more than those of the other classes, in the general appearance of their conjugational forms. But this again requires a deeper why; and that is not traceable. If it could be said that there were ten main kinds of human action, we should have approximated to the answer wanted.

 There are two main forms of conjugation, the **परस्मै-पद** “for another”; and the Tre “**आत्मने-पद**” “for self”. The former, generally speaking, belongs to the active voice, wherein one person does something to another; and the latter to the passive voice, wherein something is done ‘to one self’. But while in the passive voice formof any verb *only* the **आत्मनेपद** form is used, in the active voice the**परस्मैपद** form is usedonly generally, and, sometimes the**आत्मनेपद** form is used,and in some cases both.



The following forms occur frequently in the *Gîtâ*.

 In the technical works on grammar, rules are given for the correct use of all the ten moods and tenses; thus the first preterite should be used when the event is older than the current day; the 2nd when it occurred outside the speaker's personal knowledge; and the 3rd in any case; and so the 1st future should be used when the event is expected very shortly. But these rules, as said before, are observed only in classical composition. There is also some reason to think that they do not represent accurately the real original distinctions. It is possible that the three pasts corresponded to the English 'imperfect' and 'pluperfect' &c.

 The addition of prefixes entirely changes the meaning of the verb-root, as stated in the classical shloka on the subject.

**उपसर्गेण धात्वर्थोबलादन्यत्र नीयते।  
प्रहाराहारसंहारविहारपरिहारवत्॥**

 “The prefex violently drags away elsewhere the meaning of the verb-root; thus, with the common root **हृ**, to take away, **प्रहार** means a blow **आहार** food, **संहार** destruction **विहार**, play, and **परिहार** clearing away”. A careful analysis shows that the idea of taking away is present in some shape or other throughout all these.



 Each verb-root is capable of being modified into a causative form, a desiderative form and a frequentative form; and each of these forms is capable of independent conjugation in all moods and tenses.

 *Causative*; The causative verb is formed by the addition of **इ**, which becomes when the termination is added **य, घातयति** (ii. 21) he causes to kill, from **हन्** to kill; **नियोजयसि**(iii.1) thou causest (me) to engage, from **युज्** to join;**कार्यते** (iii.5) he is caused to do, from **कृ** to do; **विचालयेत्** (iii. 29) he may cause to be unsettled, from **चल्**to move; **अवसादयेत्**let (him) cause to sink down, from**अवसाद्** a down. to be cast down.

** ***Desiderative*; The desiderative verb expresses the wish of the agent; **स** is added, and the first letter is reduplicated **युयुत्सवः** (i.i) wishing to fight, from **युध्**to fight; **जिजी विषामः** (ii. 6) (we) wish to from जीव् to live, **चिकीर्षुः**(iii. 25) desiring to do, from **कृ** to do; **आरुरुक्षोः**(of the) wishing to ascend, from**आरुह्** to mount.

 *(e)**Derivative words.* Derivative words of various kinds, *e,g.* some indicating moods not covered by the regular conjugatious, are formed by means of affixes.

**(इच्छ) आप्तुं**= (wish) to obtain (xii. 9).

**(अशक्नोसि) कर्तुं** = (art powerless) to do (xii. 11).

**त्यक्त्वा**= having abandoned (V, 10).

**भूत्वा** = having been (ii. 20).

 Various participles, past, present and future, and some shades of tenses, which in Saṃskrit behave like adjectives and so like nouns, are also thus derived. They are declined exactly like the nouns with which they may be in apposition:



 **पश्यन्** = seeing (v. 8). **शृण्वन्** hearing (v. 8). **आसीनः** =being seated (xiv. 23). **हन्येमानः** = being slain (ii. 20).

** श्रोतव्यः** = to be heard (ii, 52). **कर्तव्यः** = to be done (iii 22). **कार्यं**= to be done (xviii. 5).

** प्रोक्तवान्**=have (or hast, or has) said (iv. 1).

** आविष्टः**= seized or possessed with (i. 28). **भक्तः** = devoted (ix. 31). **सक्तः** attached (v. 12).

** योत्स्यमानः** = going to fight (i. 23).

 Many nouns are formed by inflectional modifications of other nouns:

 **पार्थः**, the son of **पृथा**. (ii. 3.)

** कौंतेयः**, the son of **कुंती**. (ii. 14.)

 So **सौभद्रः** from **सुभद्रा**; **द्रौपदेयः** from **द्रौपदी** which itself is formed from **द्रुपद**&c. (i. 6.).

 **अक्लेद्यः, अदाह्यः, अशोष्यः** &c. meaning ‘not capable of **क्लेदः**, or **दाहः**, or **शोषः** &c., (ii. 24).

 **सत्त्वं = सत् + त्वं** = good-ness

 **अलोलुप्त्वं**= un-avaricious-ness; ness; **अतिमानिता** = very-proudness(xiv. 2).

 **ज्ञानी = ज्ञान**-possessing; (vii, 18).

 **ज्ञानवान्**= do. ; (vii. 82). 

** कुतः** (from **किं**) = 'from which (place), (ii. 2); **ततः** from **तत्** then, thence,' (vi. 45).

 **धर्म्यः** = ‘in accordance with **धर्मः**' (ii. 31) ;

** अष्टधा**= in **अष्ट** or eight ways (vii. 4). &c., &c., &c.,



 V. Sentences. The two main forms of the sentence are : (1) that in the active voice, and (2) that in the passive.

 (1) Active : **न मां कर्माणि लिपंति** (iv. 14) = Actions do not stain me.

 (2) Passive : **लिप्यते न स पापेन** (v. 10) = He is not stained by sin.

 In construing a shloka the first thing to do is to separate out the words, so as to give to each its complete and independent existence ; the coalesced tails and heads \[ **सन्धि**\] are first dissolved into their component parts; then the compound words are separated, and any lacking case-endings supplied; then the words are arranged in their prose order. In Saṃskrit order matters comparatively little, but still there is more inversion permissible in poetry than in prose. Let us take i. 2, 3.

दृष्ट्वा तु पांडवानीकं व्यूढं दुर्योधनस्तदा।  
आचार्यमुपसंगम्य राजा वचनमब्रवीत्॥

**** Separated into independent words:

 **दृष्ट्वा तु (पांडवानीकं =) पांडवानाम् अनीकं व्यूढं दुर्योधनः तदा। आचार्यम् उपसंगम्य राजा वचनम् अब्रवीत्॥**

 The prose-order :

** तदा राजा दुर्योधनः पांडवानां अनीकं तु व्यूढं दृष्ट्वा आचार्यं उपसंगम्य वचनम् अब्रवीत्॥**

**पश्यैतां पांडुपुत्राणामाचार्य महतीं चमूम्।  
व्यूढां द्रुपदपुत्रेण तव शिष्येण धीमता॥**

  Separated into independent words:



 **पश्य एतां (पांडुपुत्राणाम् = ) पांडोः पुत्राणाम् आचर्य महतीं चमूम्।**

** व्यूढां (द्रुपदपुत्रेण = ) द्रुपदस्य पुत्रेण तव शिष्येण धीमता॥**

 The English prose-order of this would run.

 **हे आचार्य पश्य एतां महतीं चमूम् पांडोःपुत्राणाम् व्यूढां तव धीमता शिष्येण द्रुपदस्य पुत्रेण॥**

 But in Saṃskrit prose-order:

** हे श्राचार्य तव धीमता शिष्येण द्रुपदस्य पुत्रेण व्यूढां एतां पांडोः पुत्राणाम् महतीं चमूम् पश्य॥**

THE BHAGAVAD-GÎTÂ.

THE GREATNESS OF THE GÎTÂ.

 Hail to Shrî Gaṇeṣha! Hail to the Lover of Râdhâ !

 Dharâ (the Earth) said: O Blessed One, O Supreme Ruler, how may unfaltering devotion arise in him who is constrained by prârabdha karma, O Lord?

 (1). Viṣhṇu said : He who, constrained by prârabdha karma, is ever assiduously practising the Gîtâ, he is liberated, he is happy in this world, he is not stained bain by karma.

 (2). If he study the Gîtâ, then can no sin stain him, as water stains not the lotus-leaf.

 (3). Where is the book of the Gîtâ, where its reading is performed, there are all holy places, there indeed Prayâga and the rest.



 (4). All Devas, Ṛiṣhis, Yogîs and Pannagas, also Gopâlas and Gopîs also, with Nârada, Uddhava, and their train.

 (5). Help comes swiftly where the Gîtâ is recited. Where the discussion of the Gîtâ, the recitation, the teaching, of it is heard, there I, O Earth, doubtless ever abide.

 (6). I dwell in the retreat of the Gîtâ; the Gîtâ is My best abode. Having mastered the wisdom of the Gîtâ, I protect the three worlds.

 (7). The Gîtâ is My supreme science, it is verily the form of Brahman. It is the half-syllable eternal (the dot on the ॐ), everlasting, the ineffable essence of the Self,

 (8). Spoken by Kṛiṣhṇa, the Omniscient, the Blessed, to Arjuna with His own mouth, the three Vedas, the final bliss, the exposition of the knowledge of the Tattvas.

 (9). The man who constantly repeats the eighteen discourses with unwavering mind, he will obtain perfect wisdom and reach the supreme goal.

 (10). If the complete recitation be impossible, then may one half be read. Then he doubtless obtains merit, equal to the gift of a cow.

 (11). By the reading of a third part, he may obtain



the fruit of bathing in Gangâ. By the repetition of a sixth part, he may obtain the fruit of the Soma-sacrifice.

 (12). He who daily reads a single discourse with devotion, he, having become a Gaṇa, obtains Rudraloka and therein long abides.

 (13). The man who daily reads a quarter-shloka, he, O Earth, remains a man during a manvantara.

 (14). The man who should read ten, seven, five, four, two, three, one, or half a shloka of the Gîtâ,

 (15). He securely obtains Chandraloka for ten thousand years. Ever engaged in the reading of the Gîtâ, passing through death, he would return to humanity.

 (16). Having again practised the Gîtâ, he obtains the supreme liberation. Engaged in the utterance, “Gîtâ,” the dying reaches the path.

 (17). Attached to the hearing of the Gîtâ, even the great sinner attains to Vaikuntha, and rejoices with Viṣhṇu.

 (18). He who meditates on the meaning of the Gîtâ, having performed actions abundantly, he should be known as a Jîvanmukta, and at the ending of the body reaches the supreme goal.

 (19). Having taken refuge in the Gîtâ, many Kings,



Janaka and the rest, praised in the world, being cleansed from sins, have gone to the supreme goal.

 (20). Having accomplished the reading of the Gîtâ, he who should not also read this description of its greatness, his reading is in vain, and his labour is lost.

 (21). He who performs the practice of the Gîtâ, associated with this discourse on its Greatness, he obtains the fruit, he may reach the path difficult of obtainment.

 (22). Sûta said: He who should read this eternal Greatness of the Gîtâ, proclaimed by me, at the end of the Gîtâ, should obtain that fruit which has been described.

 (23). Thus in the blessed Vârâhapurâṇa the greatness of the Gîtâ is set forth.

——————————————————————————

* *

*Note*. The statements made above, as to the value of reading portions, or the whole, of the *Gîtâ*, may seem at first sight to be somewhat fantastic. They should not be construed as meaning the mere reading, the lip-repetition, of verses, but rather as the mastering and assimilation of the spirit of the *Gîtâ*, and the life-repetition thereof. The man who has thus wrought the *Gîtâ* into his life is a Jîvanmukta, and the assimilation of one shloka, of several, of a quarter of the *Gîtâ*, and so on, mark various stages in human evolution, each of which has its own appropriate fruit.

**THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE HANDS ETC.**

**FOR THE GÎTÂ.**

 **ॐ** The Blessed Veda-Vyâsa is the Ṝiṣhi of this *Bhagavad*-*Gîtâ* mantra. The metre is the anuṣhṭup. Shrî Kṛiṣhṇa, the Supreme Self, is its Devatâ. “Thou grievest for those that should not be grieved for, yet speakest words of wisdom:” such is the Bija. “Abandoningall duties, come unto me alone for shelter: ” such is the Shakti. “I will liberate thee from all sins; sorrow not:” such is the Kîlakam. “Weapons cleave him not, nor fire burneth him;” thus:“To the two thumbs, all hail!” “Nor waters wet him, nor wind drieth him away;” thus: “To the two index fingers, all hail!” “Uncleavable he, incombustible he, neither to be wetted nor dried away;” thus: “To the two middle fingers, all hail!” “Perpetual, all-pervasive, stable, immovable, ancient;” thus: “To the two nameless (fourth) fingers, all hail!” “Behold, O Pârtha, my Forms,) a hundred-fold, a thousand-fold;” thus: “To the two little fingers, all hail!” “Various in kind, divine, various in colours;” thus: “To the two palms and backs of the



hands, all hail!” Such is the disposition of the hands. Now as to the disposition of the heart and the other organs. “Weapons cleave him not, nor fire burneth him;” thus: “To the heart, all hail !” “Nor waters wet him, nor wind drieth him away;” thus: “To the head, svâhâ!” Uncleavable he, incombustible he, neither to be wetted nor dried away;” thus: “To the shikhâ, vashat!” “Perpetual, all-pervasive, stable, immovable;” thus: “To the encasement, huh!” “Behold, O Pârtha, my Forms, a hundred-fold, a thousand-fold;” thus: “To the fire-weapon, phat!” For the propitiation of Shrî Kriṣhṇa the reading is enjoined.

—————————————————————————————

*Note*. A mantra, in the Hindu religion, has a Rishi, who gave it ; A metre, which governs the inflection of the voice. A Devatâ—a supernatural being, higher or lower—as its informing power. The Bîja, seed, is a significant word, or series of words, which gives it a special power; sometimes this word is a sound which harmonises with the key-note of the individual using it, and varies with the individual; sometimes this word expresses the essence of the mantra, and the result of the mantra is the flower springing from this seed; this essence of the Gîtâ is in the words quoted. The Shakti is the energy of the *form* of the mantra, i. e. the vibration-forms set up by its sounds; these in the Gîtâ carry the man to the Lord. The K**i**lakam, the pillar, is that which supports and makes strong the mantra; this is the ceasing of sorrow, by the freeing from imperfections.

 Then follow certain special directions, intended to set up relations between the centres in the man's body and the corresponding centres in the body of the Lord—the universe. The thumbs, the earth-symbol, are connected with the physical plane, and are utilised in control of its subtle forces. The index fingers, the water-symbol, are con-



nected with the astral plane, and are similarly used with astral forces. The middle fingers, the fire-symbol, the apex of the pyramid of the hand, are similarly used with mental forces. The fourth fingers, the air-symbol, are similarly used with buddhic forces. The little fingers, the most powerful in the subtle worlds, are the âkâsha-symbol, and are similarly used with âtmic forces. The other organs of the body are the other poles of the magnet of the body: thumbs and heart; index fingers and head; middle fingers and the point of juncture of the occipital and parietal sutures; the fourth fingers and the sûkshma sharîra; the little fingers and the creative organ. These are the positive and negative poles of the magnet we call the body; either may be positive, either negative, according to the object aimed at, but they work together.

 From other stand-points, these dispositions may be regarded as having on the one hand, an inhibitory, or, on the other, a stimulative effect on the physical or subtler function of the organs concerned, according to the purpose in view in the subsequent meditation or practice.

 To the western world these correspondences may seem fantastic and superstitious; to the eastern world, in which the faint tradition of the Great Science lingers, they sound as echoes of a mightier age, when Gods and Men walked familiarly together in the Hidden Ways.

THE MEDITATION ON GITA.

 **ॐ** Taught by the Blessed NârâyaṇaHimself to Arjuna; compiled by Vyâsa, the ancient Muni, in the midst of the *Mah*â*bh*â*rata*; I meditate on thee, O Mother, O Bhagavad-Gîtâ, the blessed, the pourer-forth of the nectar of Advaita, destroyer of rebirth. Hail to thee, O Vyâsa, large-minded one, with eyes like the petals of the opened lotus; by whom the lamp of knowledge, filled with the oil of the *Mah*â*bh*â*rata*, has been lighted. To the Pârijâta-kalpataru of the suppliant, to the holder of the whip, to Kriṣhṇa as Teacher, milker of the Gîtâ-nectar, all hail! All the Upaniṣhats are the cows; the Milker is the joy of the cowherds; Pârtha is the calf; the man of high intelligence is the enjoyer; the milk is the great nectar of the Gîtâ. I worship Vâsudeva, the charioteer, the God, the destroyer of Kamsa and Châṇū̂ra, the supreme joy of Devakî, Kriṣhṇa, Guru of the world. With Keshava as helmsman, verily was crossed by the Pâṇḍavas that



battle-river, whose banks were Bhîṣhma and Droṇa, whose water was Jayadratha, whose blue lotus was Gândhâra, whose crocodile was Shalya, whose current was Kripa, whose billows were Karṇa, whose terrible alligators were Asvatthâmâ and Vikarṇa, whose whirlpool was Duryodhana. May this Lotus of the *Mahâbhârata* be for our good, born on the lake of the words of Pârâsharya, sweet with the fragrance of the meaning of the Gîtâ, pollened with many stories, unfolding to the sun of the history of Hari, sucked by the bees of good men in the world day by day, cleanser of the stains of Kali. I salute Him, Mâdhava, the supreme Bliss, whose grace makes the dumb man eloquent, and the cripple a climber of mountains. Whom Brahmâ, Varuṇa, Indra, Rudra, and the Maruts praise with divine songs; whom the Sâma-chanters sing with the Vedas and with Aṅgas, in the pada and krama methods with the Upaniṣhats; whom Yogîs see by the mind fixed in meditation, to Him going; whose end Suras and Asuras know not; to that God, all hail!

**APPENDIX**.

  The following variations of the text and one or two new interpretations are printed as likely to be of use to the student. The different readings have been mostly gathered together by Bâbu Govinda Dâsa of Benares from various MSS. and different commentaries. The new interpretations have been suggested by Paṇḍit Vrindâvana Sârasvata of Benares, who passed away only in this year (1905 A. D.). The interpretations are worthy of attention because of their *prima* *facie* aptness. This gentleman used to say that he had practically studied only two works in the course of a fairly long life, the *Bhagavad*-*Gîtâ*and the *Yoga*-*Vasishtha*; and the kind of study he gave to these may be inferred from the fact that, as he said shortly before his death, he had read the *YogaVasishtha* through one-hundred and sixty-five times—and the work consists of sixty-four thousand lines-while the *Gîtâ*was read through too often to be counted. Under these circumstances it is easy to see that his interpretations are at least as notable as many older ones.
