**Southern and Northern Recensions :  
Which is more ancient and authentic?**

 In our Introduction to Vol. I, we called attention to the two outstanding recensions of the Mahābhārata, the Northern and the Southern. It is very interesting to observe that some of the main features of the Southern Recension had already been fixed as early as the 11th century (cir. 1022 A. C.) when the great Telugu Poet Nannaya Bhaṭṭa wrote his famous Āndhra Bhāratamu. The object of Nannaya was to epitomise Vyāsa's work. approximating closely to the original, without leaving the main incidents and anecdotes, as far as possible. But the real value of Nannaya's work for our purpose is that he was also careful to state, in his translation of the Parvasangrahādhyāya, the number of stanzas in each of the 18 parvans of the Mahābhārata. This furnishes us with a definite landmark in the history of Mahābhārata literature, as we are authori tatively informed by a trustworthy writer of the definite scope and bulk of the Mahābhārata in his own days. In the Parvasangrahādhyaya, he enumerates the number of stanzas in each parvan. (See at the end the

 INTRODUCTION

comparative table giving the enumeration, according to the Northern Recension, Nannaya and most of the Southern manuscripts we have been using for our edition of the Southern Recension.) The conclusion is irresistible, that, at any rate about the tenth century A. D., the Southern Recension held the field as the more authentic and reliable version of the Māhabhārata. Indeed, that the Southern Recension was the only recension available before the 10th century A. D. seems to be far more probable than otherwise.

 Utgikar, in his valuable introduction to the tentative edition of the Virātaparvan issued by B.O.R. I. as early as 1923, has already referred to the outstanding feature of the Southern Recension in that it is closely allied to the Javanese Recension of the Mahābhārata which was constituted in 996 A. D. A comparison of the Southern Recension with Juynboll's famous edition of the Javanese Recension will bear this out more fully.

 Besides, a critical comparison of the Mahābhārata so far published by B. O. R. I. (1-5 fascicules) with the Southern Recension already published by us, will also reveal the over whelming correspondence of the Southern Recension with the Kāsmir manuscripts on which the constituted Text of the Poona Edition is mainly based.

INTRODUCTION

 The fact that the Southern Recension, whichhad already been definitely fixed by Nannaya as early as the 11th century A.D., finds its counterparts in Greater India, in far-off Java as well as in distant Kashmir, goes a long way indeed to substantiate our claim that, verily, the Southern Recension is the more authentic and reliable version and perhaps the only Recension that was current in India before the 9th century A. D.

 How then are we to reconcile the differences in bulk of the Southern Recension, which comes up close on 100,000 stanzas, and the Northern Recension, which does not exceed 86,000 stanzas, if the Bombay Edition of the Text with Nilakantha's Bhāvadipa is taken as the standard representative of the Northern Recension? It has been the practice to assume till now that the Northern Recension is generally the more reliable text and that the Southern Recension has been subjected to a large variety of interpolations,—thanks to the imaginative and inventive skill of the Southern redactors—to such an extent that its present bulk comes close upon 100,000 stanzas. We have already remarked that the bulk of the Southern Recension had already been fixed round 100,000 stanzas even in the 11th century A.D., so that not much room was left for Southern redactors to have their free play after that

 INTRODUCTION

 date and we have also affirmed that the general nature of the Javanese Recension which must have left India two or three centuries earlier, if not still earlier, supports in general the main tendencies of the Southern Recension. May it not be possible, therefore, that the Northern Recension, whose representatives are found all over Middle India in greater numbers, represents a mutilated and hastily put together composition of the Middle Indian Redactors, who could not lay their hands on all manuscripts of the Mahābhārata and being perforce obliged to make the best of a bad bargain, were therefore able to get at only about 86,000 stanzas and not at the full Mahābharāta? Indeed, this seems to be quite probable as we know that, on and after the 10th century A. D., Northern, Western, Middle and Eastern India were all successively subject to a large number of predatory invasions of varying intensity, that Hindu life, with all its religious and spiritual moorings, was certainly not blessed with either the necessary safety or enthusiastic encouragement in these lands till very recently. Nilakantha, who wrote his famous Bhavadipa about the 16th Century A.D., had therefore to toil under circumstances which could not have vouchsafed to him the best of conditions, or even all the help in manuscript material that would have

 INTRODUCTION

 been essential for his huge undertaking. Even Nilakaṇṭha's work is pronounced by Utgikar to be based on 'inferior and interpolated texts' and it is interesting to note that the Southern Recension, as opposed to the Northern, which after Nilakantha's time got itself stereotyped, being mainly based on his own text, is really found unmutilated in just those regions where the political conditions were more calm and undisturbed, to wit, Kās'mir in the extreme north and the Cola and Pāndya kingdoms in the extreme south.

 We are, therefore, of opinion that it is quite probable that the Southern Recension is really the more ancient and authentic version of the Mahā. bhārata and, probably, that it was the only Recension current in India prior to the 9th century A. D.

 In so far as the Ādiparvan is concerned, we are able to point out six distinguishing marks as peculiarly characteristic of the Southern Recension. These are:—  
 (1) The complete omission in the Southern Recension of any reference to Ganes'a being suggested by Brahma and invoked by Vyāsa to be his scribe in the first chapter.  
 (2) The complete omission in the Southern Recension of any reference, soon after the above episode, to the tradition of the Mahā

 INTRODUCTION

 bhārata having been composed by Vyasa originally in sixty lakhs of stanzas out of which one lakh of stanzas alone was given out to the world of mortals and even that only indirectly through the mouth of Vaisampāyana.  
(3) The enumeration of the number of stanzas and chapters in each of the eighteen parvans, as narrated in the second chapter of the Southern Recension, varies widely from that given out in the Northern Recension.  
(4) The transposition of the Yayāti and s'akuntala episodes, which in the Southern Recension follows the normal and chronological order, whereas in the Northern Recension, S'akuntala precedes the Yayāti episode.  
(5) The complete omission in the Northern Recension of the Nālāyaniyopākhyāna, as narrated in the 189th chapter in the Southern Recension.  
(6) The omission in the Northern Recension of the incidents narrated in chapters 207, 208 and 209 (1–331₂) of the Southern Recension.  
 NOTE—Items 1-3 find further corroboration in the extracts of the India Office Manuscripts published in the Indian Antiquary (1898) by Prof. Winternitz.)

Mahabharata Text-Tradition.

 It has come to be the fashion to consider the Mahābhārata, as we have it now, to be an inflated and interpolated one and to surmise that Vyasa's original Mahābhārata should have been far more compendious and that in any case it could not have exceeded 24,000 stanzas, according to some scholars like Mr. C. V. Vaidya, and only 8,800, according to some others, like Macdonell, etc. In the introduction to Volume I, we have already pointed out the source whence arose this kind of theorising. It is the obviously interpolated northern intruder—the naive Brahma-Gaņes'a episode that has, in the main, been responsible for the above conclusions arrived at by Messrs. Vaidya and Macdonell.

 The internal evidence available in the Mahābharata itself gives us all that is necessary to form a complete account of the Text Tradition of the Mahābhārata. Krisna-Dvaipayana Vyasa is the original author of the Mahābhārata. We learn that he taught it to his pupils, including Vais'ampāyana and Romaharṣaṇa’s. Vaisampãyana again narrated the story to Janamejaya during his serpent-sacrifice. Romaharşana's, son Sūta or Sauti or Ugras'ravas, as he is variously called, narrated the same to the

 assembled ascetics and Saunaka, at Naimis a forest even as he heard it at Janamejaya's sacrifice.

 The story of the Mahābhārata, then, is narrated thrice over, first by Vyāsa, then by Vais'ampayana and again by Suta. We have already said that Sūta's father Romaharşana and Vaisampayāna were contemporaries, both of them being pupils of Vyāsa. All the three narrations, therefore, should have taken place within a very short interval of one another, as Sūta is not far removed in point of time from Vyāsa himself Besides, the occasion of Sūta's narration is very soon after his return from Janamejaya's sacrifice, where he had actually heard the story from the lips of Vaisampayana. Vais'ampāyana's narration of the story to Janamejaya could not also have been after the expiry of a considerable time from his hearing it from Vyāsa, as Vyāsa could have set himself to compose the work only after the Svargārohana of the Pāndavas, before which Pariksit, the father of Janamejaya and the grandson of Arjuna, had already been installed as Emperor. Parikşit reigned only for thirty-six years and died in his sixtieth year, when Janamejaya was too young to be invested with direct control, which was, therefore, vested in his ministers. Vyasa, who is always reckoned to be a long-lived sage, was actually present during Vais'ampāyana's

 narration of the story to Janamejaya. Indeed, Janamejaya asked Vyāsa himself to narrate the story whenVyāsa ordered his pupil Vais'ampāyana to narrate the same. Süta's narration was immediately on the conclusion of the serpent-sacrifice of Janamejaya. Thus, the text-tradition of the Mahābhārata resolves itself into a complete whole during the life-time of the original composer, Vyāsa himself.

 Nobody contends that there has been any serious overhauling of the work since Sūta's time. We are, therefore, of opinion that the text of the Mahābhārata as we have it now, according to Sūta's final narration, was substantially the same as was originally composed by Vyāsa. the differences, though only very slight, being the additional connecting links supplied within the Ādiparvan itself to facilitate the narration during Sūta's time who naturally enough refers to the point from which Vais'ampāyana began and adds also how Vyāsa came to compose the Mahābhārata.

 In Ādi—chapter I—Stanza 54, Sūta refers to three kinds of beginnings then in vogue regarding the Mahābhārata proper. Some preferred to begin it with मन्वादि, others with आस्तीकादिand yet others with उपरिचरादि. This reference by Sūta clearly indicates the development of the text-tradition

 INTRODUCTION

 even during his own time. The beginnings of the Mahābhārata with उपरिचरोपाख्यान (chapter 53) should have been the starting point of the story proper by Vyāsa himself. In chapter 49, we learn from stanza 6, of the desire of Śaunaka to hear the Mahābhārata as was narrated to Janamejaya at his serpent-sacrifice. Stanzas 28–30 deal with Janamejaya's request to Vyasa and stanzas 31-33 tell us how Vaisampayana was ordered by Vyāsa to narrate the same. Chapter 50 opens with Vais'ampayāna's statement undertaking to narrate the story and gives in Vaisampāyana's words the summary of the Mahabhārata in about fifty stanzas. Chapter 51 opens with a request from Janamajaya to narrate the story in greater detail to which Vaisampāyana replies by way of prologue to his main narration, with a statement regarding the bulk of the Mahabharata which he states to be 100,000 stanzas, computing the Mahabharata always along with the Upakhyanas, 2,000 chapters and 100 sub-sections. Vaisampayana adds that these were again recast by the sage Vyasa himself into 18 parvans or main sections (stanzas 13-15). He winds up the adhyaya with a statement regarding the excellence of the Mahabharata judged by various standards, adding that the name of Vyāsa's work which was originally called Jaya or the victory—(giver) is Mahabh^(a)rata, because herein are

 narrated the illustrious life of the Bhāratas—cf. "भारतानां महज्जन्म महाभारतमुच्यते" (stanza

52)In chapter 52, Vais'ampāyana narrates the ancestry of Janamejaya evidently as an act of courtly grace and starts off in the 53rd Chapter with the main narrative beginning from the ancestry of Vyāsa, his own guru, with the words राजोपरिचरो नाम(Adi–53–1) etc. Thus Vaišampāyana's version of the Mahabharata really begins from the 53rd chapter, with chapters 50–52 as prologue. As a matter of fact, Sūta has very little to do with the text tradition of the Mahabharata from the 50th chapter of the Adiparvan onwards, and what is more, he does not usually occur at all as a direct spokesman after this stage, the main narrative being carried on as a dialogue between Janamejaya and Vaisampayana. Suta's business then is to introduce Vyāsa's Mahābhārata to his hearers; and this he does in chapters 1 to 49 of the Ādi–Parvan.

 Sūta's narration of the story begins from the first adhyāya itself when he meets the assembled ascetics in the Naimisa forest, who request him to narrate his travels, whereupon he starts off by saying that he was just returning from Janamejaya's serpent-sacrifice where he had heard the many, great, illuminating and purifying stories narrated by Vai–

 s'ampāyana even as was told before by Vyāsa himself. In this chapter, Sūta also gives details of how Vyasa came to compose the Mahābharata, how it was composed in 100,000, stanzas, including the Upakhyānas, how the Mahābhārata proper could be computed to be 24,000 stanzas, if the Upākhyānas are not counted and how he also made a summary chapter of 150 stanzas (see stanza 661). Brahmā now comes on the scene and blesses Vyāsa and his undertaking (cf. stanza 69). Brahmā also refers to the fact that the beginning of the Mahābhārata is the Sangrahādhyāya *i.e.* the Parvasangrahādhyaya or chapter II of our text (cf. stanza 90½). Sūta then introduces the famous tree metaphor, prefacing it with the remark that Dvaipāyana also composed the Anukramanikādhyāya (stanza-97½), the essence of all the parvans, which he first taught his own son Suka and to worthy disciples, including Vaisampayana who narrated it to Janamejaya, the son of Parikṣit (stanza 100). From stanza 101 to 235 of the first chapter is a running summary of the main incidents of the Mahabharata which together with stanzas 73.94 will roughly constitute the 150 stanzas of the Anukramanikā–dhyaya referred to by Sūta as Vyāsa's work in stanza 66½. Thus we have the authority of Sūta himself that about 150 stanzas of the first chapter are actually Vyāsa's; and we have also the statement of Brahmā

 that from the Parvasangrahādhyāya onwards was Vyāsa's composition also, including the Pauloma and Āstika parvans, but omitting the Pauşya (cf. stanza 90½). The third chapter of the Adi-parvan, the Pausyaparvan, is a prologue to the Mahābhārata narrative proper, as it begins with Janamejaya's first Sattra and the incidents that led to its temporary cessation, ending with the anger of Janamejaya being roused when he heard how his innocent father had been bitten to death by the vile Takṣaka. Evidently, here ends the first day's narration of the story by Sūta.

 For, in the next chapter, Chapter IV, śaunaka personally welcomes Sūta, who, naturally enough to please him, begins afresh with the narration of the ancestry of S'aunaka ending with the eighth chapter. In the ninth chapter, S'aunaka takes up the narrative from the point where it was left off at the end of the third chapter and asks Sūta about Janamejaya's Sarpasattra and the interference of Astika thereat. As the narrative is kept up in an unbroken manner from now till we come to the Upari–caropākhyána in the fifty-third chapter, we have also the tradition that the Mahābhārata begins from the Astikopakhyāna as आस्तीकादि तथाऽपरे in stanza 56 of the first chapter. Suta's own narration of the story from the first chapter onwards, wherein he

INTRODUCTION

 refers to the first creation, Manu, etc., should therefore be naturally taken to represent the begining of the Mahābhārata as मन्वादि.

 Thus, all the three versions, मन्वादि, आस्तीकादिand उपरिचरादि are quite intelligible beginnings of the Mahabharata, as these are intended to indicate the distinct parts into which the preliminary chapters of the Ādi-parvan fall. It should also be remembered that, whereas three kinds of beginnings of the Mahābharata are referred to by Sūta, both Sūta and Vais'ampayana are quite agreed that the conclusion of Mahabharata is with the Svargārohanaparvan.

 It would thus be clear that, from the Uparicaravasu's Upākhyana Ādi–chapter 53) to the end of the Svargārohanaparvan, the text that we have is unmistakably the composition of Vyāsa himself, chapters 50 to 52 being the link supplied by Vaisampāyana, and chapters 1 to 49 being the first links supplied by Suta himself. It is also essential to assume that, though chapters 1 to 52 might owe their origir. directly to the workmanship of Sūta and Vaisampayana, the main events narrated therein and the mode of narration should have had the full approval of Vyāsa himself, as it would indeed be sheer impertinence to think of pupils editing their master's text during his life without his full per-

 INTRODUCTION

 mission and approval. Indeed, the genesis of the Mahābhārata, how Vyāsa came to compose it and how he accomplished the same, are all referred to in great detail by Sūta in the first and second chapters, which should naturally have been part of the nucleus of the Mahābhārata for Vaisampāyana too, who could have learnt it only from Vyäsa's lips.

 Even if meticulously critical scholars could allow themselves to give the title of Mahābhārata only to the portion connected with Vyasa, directly beginning from the fiftythird chapter, the total length of the Mahabharāta will suffer only by a negligible quantity.

 This cannot, therefore, vitiate the claim that the Mahābhārata is usually reputed to consist of 100,000 stanzas. Indeed, the title—Mahābhārata–was already accorded to it even during the times of Vaisampāyana and Sūta. Vais'ampāyana explains the title as (chapter 51, stanza 52½) भारतानां महज्जन्म महाभारतमुच्यते and Suta explains it as (chapter II, stan za 254½) महत्वाद्भारवत्वाच्च महाभारतमुच्यते, according to some readings, and महत्वाद्भारतत्वाच्च महाभारतमुच्यते, according to some other readings. We need hardly add that Vaisampāyana's explanation is on the whole more dignified, and full of real import.

 The contention, therefore, that Bhārata was the original title of Vyāsa's work when it consisted only

INTRODUCTION

of 24,000 stanzas or far less still and that the appellation Mahābhārata was applied to the epic only after it had grown up to well nigh 100,000 stanzas is thoroughly untenable. Equally untenable also becomes the theory that the original Mahābhārata was at any time devoid of all Upākhyānas when it consisted of 24,000 stanzas and that it came to be 100,000 stanzas only after all the Upākhyānas had been later on interpolated into the text. For, to think of the Mahābhārata without its Upākhyānas is to rob the epic of all its value as an epic. The stanza in question refers only to the two kinds of computation of the bulk of the Mahābhārata by dividing it into the story proper and the Upākhyānas and not to the plausibility of the kernel ever having existed as a separate entity without the Upakhyānas at all. And we have already shown how the whole of Mahābhārata, as we have it now, from chapter 53 of the Adi-parvan to the end of the eighteenth parvan, is completely the work of a single author. Vyāsa himself, and how in fact Vyasa set himself to compose the work only after the incidents narrated in the last of the Parvans had taken place. Thoroughly untenable also is the suggestion put forward by Mr. C. V. Vaidya in his latest work[^1] that Vyāsa

 composed the work soon after the Bhārata war in 3102 B. C., that Vais'ampāyana's redaction should have been about 1,400—1,200 B.C., that Sūta's narration in the Naimis'a forest must have been about 250 B.C., and that Vais'ampāyana and Sūta above referred to are 'fictions invented for magnifying the importance of the work.'

 We would rather accept the existing tradition that makes Vaisampāyana a direct pupil of Vyása, and Sūta a son of Vaisampayāna's contemporary, Romaharṣaṇa, than indulge in super–criticism which tries to set at naught the internal evidence of the epic and the current tradition.

 It will, therefore, be clear that the main text–tradition of the Mahābhārata is one that has been preserved with remarkable accuracy and that the whole work as we have it now in 18 Parvans is the work of a single author, Vyāsa, though it may be permissible to assume that some of the preliminary chapters of the Ādi-parvan are in their very nature connecting links supplied by Vais'ampāyana and Suta to suit the occasion when each in his turn was called upon to narrate the story.

 Thus, from the available internal evidences supported by external evidences, notably from the Javanese and Kasmiri recensions and also from the testimonies of Nannayya and of Dion Chryso-

 INTRODUCTION

 stum, who lived long before him, we are driven to the irresistible conclusion that the Mahābhārata text-tradition, as we have it now in the Southern Recension, is quite authentic and reliable, that the final redaction of the story from the beginning of the first chapter as narrated by Sūta is equally trustworthy and that the extent and scope of the Mahābhārata even during Sūta's time consisted of eighteen main parvans with one hundred sub-parvans, divided into two thousand chapters and comprising one hundred thousand stanzas. A truly scientific and historical reconstruction of the text should, therefore, lead us to constitute the text to its original dimensions and not to cast off or artificially reduce its size under the mistaken notion that the Mahābhārata, to be Vyāsa's, should necessarily be considerably short of 100,000 rather than near 100,000, stanzas.

**————**

 In the preparation of this volume for the press all the five manuscripts described in pp. XIV-XV of the Introduction to the first volume were utilised in full. अ continues to represent the principal text printed, and क,ख,गand घhave been utilised for giving additional readings, etc. One more manuscriptक has also been utilised for further readings, etc. from pp. 1348. This manuscript belongs to Mr. Krishnaswami Sastrigal, Sub-Registrar, Tanjore. Its description is as follows:—

 ङ. Substance—palm-leaf; Size—171 x 2¾ inches; Leaves—231; Lines—13 to a page; Script— Grantha; Ādiparvan complete; Date of transcription—the second day of the Karthigai month of Kollam year 975, corresponding to the 14th November 1799. A. D.

 With the issue of the second volume, the Adi Parvan is complete. It will be noticed that, according to our critical edition, the total number of chapters in the Adiparvan is 218—the figure given in the Parvasangrahādhyāya of this edition, and which is generally agreed to by all manuscripts representative of the Southern Recension (see pp.

 XVIII of the introduction to the first volume). The total number of stanzas in the Ādiparvan in all these 218 chapters, according to our critical edition, comes to [9984½](http://%C2%A0The%20numerical%20addition%20will%20give%209,985%20stanzas,%20but%20a%20half-stanza%20occuring%20in%20pp.%20677,%20already%20remarked%20by%20us%20as%20अनन्वित,%20should%20be%20deducted. "The numerical addition will give 9,985 stanzas, but a half-stanza occuring in pp. 677, already remarked by us as अनन्वित, should be deducted.")which is half a stanza more. than what is enumerated for the Ādiparvan by Nannaya, the great Telugu Poet (in his Andhra Bhāratamu pp. 7-35 prose) who flourished about 1022 A. D.. Nannaya's enumeration of the number of stanzas in each of the Parvans of the Mahabhārata is the earliest direct external evidence we have so far, among the manuscripts and printed material available for the Mahabharata. In all such enumerations, the usual practice seems to be to leave out prose passages from all calculation. We have, therefore, indicated at the end of each of the chapters, the number of stanzas contained therein separately from the number of prose passages in the same, if any.

 In his editorial note prefixed to the third fascicule of the Aliparvan, Dr. Sukthankar has already called attention to the enumeration of stanzas in this Parvan as varying from 7,984 to 10,984 and stated that he prefers the figure 7,984 as it represents the Kasmiri version and is also the shortest version

 of the Parvan hitherto known. The majority of manuscripts usually state 8,884 stanzas to be thelength of the Adiparvan though Nannaya has definitely stated 9,984 stanzas to be the extent of this Parvan. It would now be clear why we chose for our principal text of the Southern Recension अ kosa; for, therein the length of the Ādiparvan is said to be 9,884 stanzas or one hundred short of what Nannaya has said. Indeed, this shortage by one hundred stanzas is just the additional portion that we have added on to the principal text in editing the same in order to fill up some easily discernible lacunae in the manuscript itself.

 In the footnote to pp. 1412, we have already indicated how we had to restore the text to the extent of 70, stanzas, which together with the restoration in other places of stanzas ranging from a half to four or five which we had added to the principal text while editing the same will just account for the 100 stanzas being found short according to the narration of the अ-कोशfrom the figure given by Nannaya. In the last sheet attached to one of the manuscripts in the Madras Government Oriental Manuscripts Library (Vide Descriptive Catalogue No. 1916), the Adiparvan is stated to contain 9,984 stanzas. One of the Kāsmiri version manuscripts collated by

 INTRODUCTION

 Dr. Sukthankar—K 6, also agrees with Nannaya in giving the length of the Ādiparvan as 9,984 stanzas. We may be permitted to add that, according to our critical edition of the Southern Recension, the result we have obtained is approximately the same as Nannaya's and, therefore, justfies Nannaya's recitation as certainly authoritative at any rate in so far as the Southern Recension is concerned.

 A careful study of the Adiparvan as issued by us in comparison with Dr. Sukthankar's edition is certainly called for, if only to assess critically the large and small additions and omissions that are detectable in one or the other Editions. We defer our remarks on this aspect till the completion of the Ādiparvan by the Bhandarkar Institute. But we must not omit to call attention to one or two points arising from the work so far published.

 In pp. 574 of his Edition (Fascicule 5), in trying to vindicate the superiority of the (Kāsmiri) S'ārada version, Dr. Sukthankar states that "all the remaining versions are not only heavily interpolated but also *indiscriminately conflated" * (italics are not ours), a conclusion he has arrived at on the omission. of Kaņinkanīti not only in the S'aradă recension but also in Kşemendra's Bharatamañjari, in the Javanese version and in the Telugu adaptations by Nannaya Bhatta, etc. There are only four printed editions of Nannaya Bhaṭṭa's work so far known to us. In all these, and in all the available manuscripts in important libraries in Madras, we have been able to obtain definite and unmistakable evidence of the inclusion of the reference to Kaninkaniti in the

INTRODUCTION

 exact place in which it occurs in the printed edition of the Southern Recension. A reference to stanza 101 in pp. 158 of Nannaya's Bharata (Vol. I printed by Vavilla Ramswami Sastrulu & Sons, Madras) will bear out the contention that Nannaya was quite familiar with the imparting of the niti by Kaninka to Dhṛtarāstra. Now, we come to the most difficult problem of our Mahābhārata Text criticism. Here is a writer of definite date (1022 A. D.) whose task is only to epitomise the Mahabharata and who refers to an incident in unmistakable words. Its omission by later writers cannot provemuch, except perhaps that their versions are mutilated. Its omission by earlier hands certainly needs explanation. The only evidence that needs to be explained is that of the Javanese version. Certainly, the Javanese version cannot lay claim to be a thoroughly complete and full version of the Original Mahābhārata. It must needs be also only an abridgement and adaptation though it may have branched off from the parent stem two or three centuries earlier than Nannaya. An inclusion in the Javanese version, if omitted in any Indian Recension by later scholiasts may point to some defect in the latter, but not an omission in an earlier version which is prima facie only an abridgement and an adaptation. Judged by these standards, we are afraid that the omission

 of Kaninkaniti in all the manuscripts and printed material in India; which are subsequent to Nannaya's time, can only prove the mutilated nature of our manuscript–tradition, rather than make Nannaya's and other versions that include Kaninkaniti to be either *indiscriminately inflated* or otherwise untrustworthy.
