This inscription seems to be incomplete.

It records a regulation instituted by the merchants on the sea and those residing in the seashore towns. It states that whosoever stayed at mottuppalli his needs must be fulfilled, and there was no objection for him to move to any place. The levy called *aputrika-dendam* was not to be imposed on the foreigners. The usual rate of customs was allowed on gold and silver. Three-fourth of the former duty was remitted on exported sandal. Foreigners could sell their merchandise to whomsoever they liked and could buy whatever other articles merchandise the duty was to be levied as before. This was the procedure followed in the *anjinanpugalidam* (place of security to persons in distrees).

It further records that for every 100 articles imported from the south 3 articles should be given and for every 100 clothes, two clothes should be given etc.
