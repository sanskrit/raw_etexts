**INTRODUCTION**

The earliest epigraph in this volume, barring the Asokan inscriptions from Jaugada (Nos. 87-99) and Siddapura (Nos. 54-56), is from a cavern called *Jnaniyarmadam* on the hill at Kunnakkudi in Tiruppattur Taluk of Ramanathapuram District (No. 45). This record in Brahmi characters of about the 2^(nd) century B. C. is written strangely, the letters of which resemble the *mirror* images. It mentions Cattan, the son of Atan of Upiur.

The same cave has an inscription on one of its pillars in Vatteluttu characters of the 7^(th)-8^(th) centuries referring to Masilichchura.
This is evidently the name of the deity called Masilisvara, after which the rock-cut temple came to be called Masilisvaram.

**Pallavas.** â€“No. 68 from Tirukkalukkunram in the Chingleput District, representing the Pallava dynasty is of the king Narasingappottarasar who took Vatapi. [\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_26/introduction.html#_ftn1)
No. 79 is from Tirupporur of the same district, which has been assigned to Narasimha II[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_26/introduction.html#_ftn2) on the basis of the epithets occurring the in the record. The next king represented in the volume is Dantivarman whose short name is indicated as Danti.[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_26/introduction.html#_ftn3) (No. 774). The *mandapa* dedicated to Siva and Siva (i.e., Gauri) in the Kailasa temple here built by Danti, was constructed by a certain woman named Valli, during his reign. A temple of Tambiran was also his gift (No. 778).

The undated and the only inscription of Kampavarman is from Olakkur (No. 378) which refers to the destruction of the village.[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_26/introduction.html#_ftn4)

**Cholas.** â€“Of the innumerable Chola inscription included in the volume the earliest record (No.411) of this dynasty belongs to the Chola king *Madirai-konda Parakesari.*

But reference to an order issued in the time of Vijayalaya directing the grant of a tax-free *devadana* (No.726) is made in the reign of Tribh Konerinmaikondan. This mentions a Kalappalarayan as a signatory of the grant made in accordance with the order of the early Chola king. He was an officer under Kulottunga III[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_26/introduction.html#_ftn5) whose part in the administration is indicative enough from the records of the Chidambaram temple.

The donor Maladudaiyan Natan Siddavadavan mentioned in No. 411, which is from Siddhalingamadam, South Arcot District, is a chief of Miladu, who may be identified with Virasola Miladudaiyan. [\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_26/introduction.html#_ftn6)
It may be recalled that Parantaka I had Virasola as one of

His titles and if this is the earliest record that mentions this title of the chief it is not impossible that he was a subordinate of the same Chola king. These Chedi chiefs of Miladu[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_26/introduction.html#_ftn7) or Maladu who figure in a number of records of Tirukkoyilur and other adjacent places in South Arcot District were related to the Chola kings by their matrimonial alliance and by owing their allegiance to them.

An inscription from Konerirajapuram dated in the 14^(th) year of Parakesari (No. 672) records an agreement of five persons belonging to the temple of Tirunallam, a *Brahmadeya* in Vennadu to provide for food offerings and worship to god Ganapatibhatarar during the 3 *sandhis* in the temple from out of the grant of 7 ma of land endowed by paramesvara-Perilamaiyar of the village. *Ilamai,* also termed *elame* in the Kannada inscriptions, is a group or body which seem to have taken part in the land transactions of the temple, as is evident from the present record. They are like the *urar, Nagarattar*, the *nattar* and the *sabhaiyar*. The Parakesari[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_26/introduction.html#_ftn8) of this record has been identified with Uttamachola.[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_26/introduction.html#_ftn9)

About 4 records of this volume assigned to Uttamachola have been published in S. I. I., Volume III (Nos. 130, 147, 151 and 151-A).

About 22 inscriptions in this collection are assignable to Rajaraja I. No. 412 from Siddhalingamadam dated in the 4^(th) year records a gift made by Maladudaiyan . . . . . .

Of 10 kalanju of gold for 12 *sandhi* lamps to be burnt during the evening sandhi to god Tiruppulippagavar of Sirringur, a brahmadeya in Kurukkaik-kurram in Maladu. This Maladudaiyan may be identified with Raman alias Arumolideva maladudaiyar, called after the surname *Arumolideva* borne by his overlord Rajarja I.

Two of his records dated in the 11^(th) (No. 673) and 26^(th) (No. 666) years from Konerirajapuram in Tanjore District refer to the *perunguri sabhai* of Triunallam, a *Brohmadeya* in Vennadu who met in the *tirukkavanam* in front of the *srikoyil* in the temple of Tirunallam-unaiyar and received the order (*srimugam*) from Udaiyapirattiyar, same as queen Udaiyapirattiyar Sembiyan-Madeviyar who built a stone temple in the name of Gandaradityar for god Mahadeva at Tirunallam before the 3^(rd) year of the reign of Uttamachola, (No. 680).[\[10\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_26/introduction.html#_ftn10)

No. 686 from the same place, dated in the 12^(th) year of Rajaraja I, records a gift of lands made by a certain Arinjigai Ninran of Vadaga\[rai\]mangalam or Vadakanmangalam in Vennadu to provide for food offerings, worship, lamps for bathing the image on the occasions of *Sankranti,* eclipse, for the *kalasa-puja*, and for clothes to god Tirumalattanam-udaiya-mahadeva of this village. The name Arinjigai suggests that the donor is named after king Arinjaya, also called Arinjigar-varman, the grandfather of Rajaraja I. The village, to which this donor belonged, is perhaps the same as is referred to in the record of Parakesarivarman Uttamachola, as Vadakannamangalam in the same *nadu.*

Another inscription of the same yare of this king records a gift of a silver image (of a deity) weighing 24 *kalanju* and a copper image of Chandesvaradeva weighing 500 *palam,*

By a certain Nakkan Nallattadigal, belonging to the Rajarajatterinja-Kaikkola community, who was the son of Anukkan Mahamalli, a servant in the palace establishment (*velattu-pendatti*)[\[11\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_26/introduction.html#_ftn11) of Rajakesariparmar, i.e., the king.

It may be inferred from the expression *Velattu* *pendatti* in relation to *Anukkan* that the latter term represents a group of people attending upon the person of the king or in attendance of the king always. It may also be inferred from this, that Rajaraja I had continued the practice of his great-grandfather in maintaining the servants in the palaceestablishment, who attended on the king like the *Anukka-Bhimar-padai.* (*S. I. I., VoI. XIII,*
