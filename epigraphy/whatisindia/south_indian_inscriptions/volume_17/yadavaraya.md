This inscription commences with the *prasasti samasta-sakala-bhuvana*, etc., of Tirukkalattideva Yadavaraya who is a well known feudatory of the Chola king Rajaraja III. Hence the year 8 cited in the body of the record is probably the regnal year of the Chola king.

This seems to record the gift of the villages Tirukkalattidevanallur and Munaimedu *alias* Tirukkalattideva-chaturvedimangalam is Chela-nadu as a tax-free *kani*, for the merit of a certain svamidevar whose name is lost and who is stated to have belonged to the *Santana* of Lakshadhyaya-mudaliyar and who is also said to have been the preceptor to the Chola and Pandya kings.
