Kudatini, Bellary Taluk, Bellary District.

On a fragment of slab built into the platform in

front of the Kumarasvamin temple. **Nityavarsha. (Indra III).**

This inscription engraved in early Nagari characters consists of three section (A. B. and C) of which the third (C) is engraved in a different hand and does not appear to belong to the first two.

Section A belongs to the Rashtrakuta king Nityavarshadeva Prithvi-Vallabha who is stated to have meditated at the feet of Akalavarshadeva. The Saka year cited at the beginning is lost due to damage and **Vikrama, Magha, su. Rathasaptami, Sunday,** are the only details of date available (See Introduction).

Section B seems to deal with the exploits of a chief called Aiyanaiya and refers to a princess of the Sindu (for Sindhu ?) family. The date is lost here also.

Section C mentions Dhora and describes the achievements of the two chieftains belonging to the Chalukya family, Balavarman and his son, Dasavarman, Kanchi and the planting of the two teeth of a tusker are mentioned in this connection.
