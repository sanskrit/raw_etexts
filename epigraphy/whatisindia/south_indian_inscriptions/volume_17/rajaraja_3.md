**Madyasthanathesvara temple.** **Rajaraja III. Year 11 : 1226-27 A.D.**

Ponparappinaperumal, in whose reign the inscription is dated, is probably identical with Rajaraja III (cf., S.I.I., Vol. VIII, No. 80).

It records the construction of a shrine for Tandesurappillaiyar and the setting up of the images of Ilaiya Pillaiyar and his two consorts (Nachchimar) in the temple of Tirunagisuram-udaiya Nayanar of Tiruppalaippandal, by Senai A\[t\*\]kondar Nathan Tirunanasambandavellan of Manamarudu.

**On the west wall of the mandapa in front of the central shrine in the**

**Madhyasthanathesvara temple.** **Rajaraja III. Year 2 :1217 A.D.**

This inscription registers an agreement (ubhayattittu) given to Viranam-udaiyan Udaiyan Tiruk\[ka\]tturaiyudaiyan alias Alangarappiriyan, the \[u\]ukanakku of Pennagadam by three svabrahmanas who were in the enjoyment of kani in the temple of god Tirunagisvara-udaiya Nayanar of Tiruppalaippandal to supply the necessary articles (specified) for the worship of the god on sivaratri day in the month of Masi with the interest on the 300 kasu received from the former in the month of Purattadi of the year.

**Madhyassthanathesvara temple.** **Vijaiyarajendrachola \[Rajendra III\]. Year 11 : 1256-57 A.D.**

**No. 296.**

**(A. R. No. 268 of 1904).**

**Yogimallavaram, Puttur Taluk, Chittoor District.**

**On the north wall of the Parasaresvara temple.**

**Rajaraja III. year 9 : 1224 â€“ 25 A.D.**

The endowment recorded in this inscription was originally made in the reign of Rajaraja I (vide Nos. 297 and 300). Since in the former, Vira Narasingadeva Yadavaraya, a well-known feudatory of Rajaraja III is mentioned, the king of this record may be identified with Rajaraja III.

This records the endowment of 26 Â¼ kalanju of gold weighed by kudinai for various services and offerings to god Pippaladichcharamudaiya Nayanar by the sabha of Tiruchchukanur. The gift was taken over by the sivabrahmanas of this temple.

**No. 297.**

**(A. R. No. 269 of 1904).**

**Yogimallavaram, Puttur Taluk, Chittoor District.**

**On the north wall of the Parasaresvara temple.**

**Rajaraja III. Year 9 : 1224 â€“ 25 A. D.**

This inscription is dated in the month of Tai of the 9th year of Rajaraja III. It refers to an endowment made on the 80th day of the 23rd year of rajaraja I. it also mentions Salukki Vira Narasingadeva alias Yadavaraya, as the ruler of the place (vide Nos. 296 above and 299 below).

The records an enquiry conducted by the aforesaid Yadavaraya, the Srimahesvaras and the Sthanattar, held in Tirukkannappadevan-tirukkavanam, into a complaint made by the sthanattar of the temple of god Pippaladisvaramudaiya-mahadeva in Tiruchchukanur, a brahmadeya in Tirukkudavur-nadu in Perumbanappadi-ttiruvengada-kkottam in Jayangondasola-mandalam, against the sabha of the same place that the latter failed to carry out the provisions of an endowment of 26 Â¼ kalanju for services and offerings during Uttarayana Samkramana to God Pippaladisvaramudaiya-mahadeva, made by Namban Kuttadi alias Jayangondasola-Brahmarayan of Aruvetovai kot (?), a brahmadeya in Nenmali-nadu in Arumolideva-valanadu in Solamandalam on the 80th day of the 23rd regnal year of Rajaraja I, having received the amount of the endowment from the donor. As the complainants could produce in evidence an epigraphical record of this transaction, the sabha was directed to pay the 26 Â¼ kalanju into the temple treasury.

The uravar of Ilamandiyam, Erppidipattu, Avilali, Gunduppakkam, Tenappalli-Munnaippundi, Tandalam, etc., figure as signatories to this inscription.
