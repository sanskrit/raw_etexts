SOUTH INDIAN INSCRIPTIONS

VOLUME XVII

**INSCRIPTIONS COLLECTED DURING 1903 - 1904**

**NAYAKAS OF TANJORE**

**Achyutappa-Nayaka**

**No. 581.**

**(A. R. No. 536 of 1904).**

**Tiruvaur, Nagapattinam Taluk, Tanjore District**

**On another slab built into the floor of the first *prakara*, north of the central shrine in the Tyagarajasvamin temple.** **Achyutappa-Nayaka 1564 A.D. (?)**

This inscription is dated in S. 1482, Rudhirodgarin Panguni 29. The saka and the cyclic years do not tally. Rudhirodgarin falls in Saka 1485.

This seems to record the grant of income from levies such as *araimanai sodi, adhikar* \[*kadaikkuttu*\], and *sodi-puravagai* as *sarvamanya*, for the merit of his father Sevvappa Nayaka of Nedungunram by Achyutappa Nayaka. Other details are lost as the inscription is damaged.
