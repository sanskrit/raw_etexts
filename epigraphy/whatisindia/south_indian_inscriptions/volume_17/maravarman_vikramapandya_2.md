**Mara. Kulasekhara III**

**No. 392.**

**(A. R. No. 362 of 1904).**

**Narttamalai, Pudukkottai Taluk, Tiruchirappalli District.**

**On the east wall of the prakara of the Tirumalaikkadambar temple.**

**Mara. Kulasekhara III. Year 31 : 1346 A. D.**

The details of date given viz., 31st year, Mina, su. 10, Friday with Punarpusam correspond to 1346 A.D., March 3.

This records the grant of land, purchased from the Sivabrahmanas of the temple of God Tirumalaikkadamburudaiya Nayanar in Telingakulakalapuram alias Kulottunga solapattinam, a town in Konadu alias Kadaladaiyadilangaikondasola-valanadu, for 54 anradu-varahan, to the god of the same temple for a service called Ulkappu, offerings at midday and midnight and two lamps, by Annalvayiludaiyan Kannudaiyan Alagiyanayan alias Gurukulattaraiyar. The land seems to have been part by part mortgaged to the donor by the predecessors of the above-said Sivabrahmanas. The Sri Mahesvara-kkankani appears to have taken over the land and agreed to execute the wishes of the donor whatever fate befell the lands.

Text published in Inscriptions (Texts) of the Pudukkottai State, No. 445.

**Maravarm an Vikramapandya III**

**No. 202.**

**(A. R. No. 181 of 1904).**

**On the west wall of the mandapa in front of the central shrine in Chandramaulisvara temple.**

**Maravarman Vikramapandya III. Year 6 : 1288-89 A.D.**

This inscription commences with the prasasti Samasta bhuvanekavira, etc., of the king and is dated on the 273rd day of the 6th year.

It records a tax-free gift of land by the king to god Aludaiya Nayanar at Tiruvakkarai, a taniyur of Mattur-nadu in Jayangondasola-mandalam, for a special daily service called Vikrama-Pandiyan sandhi and an annual festival to be called Vikramapandiyan tirunal, both named after himself.

After the signatures of Gunamangalam-udaiyan and Valudiyadaraiyan the phrase tirueluttu occurs, perhaps signifying royal assent.

**No. 210.**

**(A. R. No. 188 of 1904).**

**Tiruvakkarai, Viluppuram Taluk, South Arcot District.**

**On the east wall of the mandapa inside the first prakara of the Chandramaulisvara temple.**

**Vikramapandya (III ?) Year 4 : 1286-87 A.D.**

The characters of this inscription are of the 13th century A.D. Hence the king Perumal Vikramapandya may be identified as Maravarman Vikramapandya (III) who ascended the throne in A.D. 1283.

It records the construction of the mandapa by the Pandya queen, Ulagamuludumudaiyar.
