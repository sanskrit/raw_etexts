SOUTH INDIAN INSCRIPTIONS

VOLUME XVII

**INSCRIPTIONS COLLECTED DURING 1903 - 1904**

**INTRODUCTION**

The earliest epigraph in the present volume is No. 262 from Tirunatharkunru near Singavaram in the South Arcot District, Madras. It is engraved on a rock, which is stated to have been the *nisidika* of Chandranandi Asirigar who fasted for 57 days. The cave inscriptions from the Ramanathapuram, Madurai and Tirunelveli Districts, apart, this short inscription appears to be the earliest epigraph in Tamil. Its palaeography is interesting as a few letters (*a, ai, ma, ta, na* and *ra*) reveal distinctly the archaic forms of the Vatteluttu alphabet and a few others (*ka, cha, ra*) point to their evolution direct from the Brahmi alphabet[](#_ftn1). One can discern a connection of the present record, though separated by a long interval, with the records of Narasimhavarman and Isvaravarman and the Tirukkalukkunram inscription of Narasimhavarman I, which are written in a mixed variety of the Tamil alphabet. The provenance of the present record representing the earliest form of this mixed alphabet seems to indicate that Vatteluttu might have once been used all over the Tamil land.

Another short inscription No. 261 copied from the same place records the fasting of Ilaiya-Bhatarar for 30 days. This practice of fasting (*anasana*) is called *Sallekhana* in Jaina religious literature, which requires the monks to gradually reduce their food and finally to starve themselves to death in order to avoid the sufferings due to disease or old age.

The next important inscription is No. 49 from Kudatini in the Bellary District, Mysore State. It consists of three different pieces. Though all of them may be palaeographically assigned to about the tenth century, one is unconnected with another. The beginning of piece A containing the date of the record is badly damaged. However, it contains the details, viz., Vikrama, Magha su. Rathasaptami, Sunday. It then refers to the reign of a king called Nityavarshadeva Prithvivallabha who meditated on the feet of Akalavarshadeva. Nityavarsha who succeeded Akalavarsha is obviously identical with Indra III (917-18 A.D.). Hence the cyclic year Vikrama cited in the record would correspond to Saka 842 expired, equivalent to 920-21 A.D. According to the *Indian Ephemeris* the details given in this record will correspond to January 19, 921 A.D., which was, however, a Friday but not Sunday as stated in the record. On the basis of this and a few other records it has now been proved that the reign of Indra III extended beyond 918 A.D., the earliest available date for his successor Govinda IV.

Piece B engraved in similar characters records in verse the exploits of a chief called Aiyanaiya. He is stated to have defeated his enemies and to have captured a fort. It mentions a title Sri-Bharadankakara and a princess of Sindhu-kula. The piece being a fragmentary one, a connected account of the facts referred to cannot be made out. The copper-plate charters of the Western Chalukya dynasty refer to a chief called Ayyana as one of the ancestors of the Chalukyas of Kalyana who married the daughter of a certain Krishna. Whether Aiyanaiya whose exploits are described at length in the present record is identical with Chalukya Ayyana cannot be determined without further light on the subject.

Piece C records the exploits of Balavarman and his son Dasavarman, born in the Chalukya family. The former is stated to have crowned one Dhora king of a territory wrested by him from Prabhuta and to have defeated and lord of Kanchi and to have installed the teeth of a tusker in front of god Brahmesvara at Alampura. The inscription being incomplete, the details of the adventures of Dasavarman are lost to us.

By far the largest number of inscriptions incorporated in the volume belong to the Imperial Cholas. One (No. 501) of the earliest records of this dynasty belongs to the Chola king Parantaka I (907-953 A.D.) This inscription is dated in the 32^(nd) year (in words) of Parantaka described as the destroyer of the fortified city of Madurai. It records the gift of a lamp by Gunavan, an illustrious native of Idaiyur and a vassal of the Chola king (*valavan*). The inscription then proceeds to describe what appears to be an encounter between the Chola monarch land the king of Ceylon. The epigraph is unfortunately very faintly engraved at this portion of the stone leaving us in doubt as to the exact meaning of this section. If it really refers to an encounter, we have reason to surmise that the actual invasion of Ceylon was preceded by several attempts to drive the Ceylonese intruders from the mainland. In this connection it may be noted that an inscription from Kudumiyamalai belonging to 33^(rd) regnal year of Parantaka I, re-engraved under the orders of Maravarman Sundarapandya I, speaks of an invasion of Ceylon launched by Pirantakan Kunjiramallan *alias* Virasola Ilangovelan. The title *Maduraiyum Ilamum konda* was assumed by Parantaka I only from the 36^(th) year of his reign, although there are two stray records attributing the conquest of Ceylon to Parantaka I. The Kudumiyamalai inscription seems to suggest that the conquest of Ceylon which came to be largely attributed to Parantaka I only from his 36^(th) regnal year was actually preceded by several attempts to expel the invader who came to the rescue of Rajasimha, the Pandya contemporary of the Chola king. Among the queens of Parantaka I figuring as donors in some of the records published in the volume, Muttakilanadigal, the daughter of Kadupattigal, deserves mention. She gave a fly-whish gilt with gold and silver to the god at Vedaranyam, Tanjore District (No. 517). The title *Muttakilanadigal* seems to indicate that she was the senior queen of apparently the reigning king in whose 38^(th) year the record is dated. I so, Parantaka I should have continued the policy of his father in contracting marriage alliances with the Pallava family.

The Chandramaulisvara temple at Tiruvakkarai in the South Arcot district, which has yielded 45 inscriptions (Nos. 186 â€“ 230), enjoyed the patronage of the well-known royal personage Sembiyan-mahadeviyar, the queen of Gandaraditya and the mother of Uttamachola. Inscription No. 222 engraved on the south base of the ruined Siva shrine within the Chandramaulisvara temple records that the shrine called *sivalokam* in the inscription was raised in stone by her for god Paramasvamigal and that the village of Manali in Anmur-nadu in Oyma-nadu was granted to it. The inscription gives elaborate details regarding the apportionment of the produce to be measured out by the villagers of Manali to the temple for the various items of worship and offerings as also the minor incidental charges incurred in the transit of the produce and such other processes. All expenses are counted in terms of paddy. The scrupulous care with which every item is provided for, recalls to oneâ€™s mind the similar arrangements made in the Big Temple at Tanjore built and well-endowed by Rajaraja I in whose reign the present record is dated. It is no wonder that temples, wherever they were, were richly endowed during his reign.
