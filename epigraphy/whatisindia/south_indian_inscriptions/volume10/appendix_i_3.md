The only cyclic year which ends with *shu* is Vishu in which year (Saka 1263) Pushya su. 5 fell on a Thursday (not Monday as cited) ; neither was it a day of Samkranti. But in the previous year i.e., Vikrama, Makara-samkranti took place on Monday which was Pushya su. 6 (not 5)

= A. D. 1340, December 25, Monday. This is probably the intended date.

**563**

**568**

695 of 1926

Saka 1319, Isvara, Chaitra, su. 15, Thursday. In Isvara, Chaitra su. 15 ended at â€™15 on Wednesday

= A. D. 1397, March 14. The slight error in the week day is probably due to some local calculation.

**569**

580 of 1909

Saka 1319, Isvara, Phalguna, ba. 13, Thursday.

Phalguna ba. 13 of the cyclic year Isvara did not fall on a Thursday.
