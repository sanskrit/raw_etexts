**202**

322 of 1919

Saka 1108, Magha, ba.14, Wednesday

= A.D. 1186, February 19, Wednesday ; f. d. t. '19. The Saka year was current.

**203**

739 of 1920

Saka 1109, Asvayuja, su. . , Tuesday.

Probably = A.D. 1187, September 8, Tuesday. Since there is space for only one figure denoting the *tithi* it may be 5. This *tithi* was current practically throughout Tuesday.

**205**

37 of 1912

Saka 1117, Magha, su. 3, Thursday

= A.D. 1196, January 4, Thursday ; f. d. t. '54

**206**

309 of 1920

Saka 1117, Uttarayana-samkranti.

Probably = A.D. 1195, December 26, Tuesday. Details are not enough for verification.

**207**

845 of 1917

Saka 1120, Jyeshtha, su. \[1\], Vaddavara

= A.D. 1198, May 9, Saturday ; '01 ' su. 1 was current for a very short time. It is likely that the figure in the brackets is 2.

**208**

561 of 1925

Saka 1122, Phalguna, su. 8, Monday

= A.D. 1201, February 12, Monday ; '43.

**209**

327 of 1924

Saka 1124, Dundubhi, Vaisakha, su. 3.

In Dundubhi there was an Adhika-Vaisakha. If the Adhika month was intended, the equivalent would be A.D. 1202, March 28, Thursday ; if the Nija month was intended, the equivalent would be A.D. 1202, April 26, Friday. The details are, however, not enough for verification.

**210**

302 of 1924

Saka 1129, Mesha-samkranti.

Probably = A.D. 1207, March 25, Sunday ; the date does not admit of verification.

**211**

97 of 1909

Saka 112, Marggasira, su. 10, Thursday.

There are three probable dates : -

(i) A.D. 1200, November 16, Thursday, f. d. t. '75

(ii) AD. 1204, December 2, Thursday, f. d. t. '95

\(iii\) A.D. 1207, November 29, Thursday, f. d. t. '82.

= A.D. 1106, March 25, Sunday ; f. d. t. '70

****

**241**

273 of 1905

**KAKATIYAS.**

Saka 1107, Visvavasu, Pushya, su. 1, Thursday, Makara-samkranti.

Irregular. By the *tithi* the equivalent would be A.D. 1185, December 24, Tuesday, â€™84 ; by the samkranti the equivalent would be December 25, Wednesday. In either case the week day was not Thursday.

**242**

300 of 1924

Saka 1121, solar eclipse.

In Saka 1121 expired there was no solar eclipse. The only solar eclipse in Saka 1121 current occurred in the month of Magha = A.D. 1199, January 28, Thursday.

**243**

575 of 1925

Saka 1121, Chaitra, ba. 15, Wednesday

= A.D. 1198, April 8, Wednesday ; '25. The Saka year was current.

**244**

576 of 1925

Saka 1127, Karttika, su. 15, Monday

= A.D. 1204, November 8, Monday ; f. d. t. 27. The Saka year was current.

**245**

262 of 1924

Saka 127, \[Mar\]ggasira, ba . . . dasi, Thursday

= A.D. 1205, December 8, Thursday ; the *tithi* was evidently *ekadasi* which lasted on Thursday till '43.

**246**

177 of 1905

Saka 11\[3\]0, Vibhava, Karttika, su. 15, Monday, lunar eclipse. In Vibhava, Karttika, su. 15, was not a Monday nor was there a lunar eclipse on that day ; but in Sravana of that year, su. 15 fell on a Monday land a lunar eclipse also occurred. If Karttika is a mistake for Sravana the equivalent would be A.D. 1208, July 28, Monday ; f. d. t. '04.

According to the *Madras Epigraphical Report,* however, the Saka year is 11\[9\]0 in which year the given details correspond regularly to A.D. 1268, October 22, Monday, when there was a lunar eclipse. (See App.
II.)

**248**

803 of 1922

Saka 1131, Mesha-samkranti

Probably = A.D. 1209, March 24, Tuesday on which day the samkranti commenced at 19.40 hours after sunrise. Details are not enough for verification.

**249**

554 of 1925

Saka 1131, Chaitra, ba. 2, Samkramana, Wednesday

= A.D. 1209, March 25, Wednesday ; '18.

**250**

281 of 1924

Saka 1131, Sukla Asvayuja, su. 2, Wednesday

= A.D. 1209, September 2, Wednesday ; f.d.t. '15.

**251**

280 of 1924

Saka 1131, Sukla Asvayuja, su. 2, Wednesday

= A.D. 1209, September 2, Wednesday ; f.d.t. '15.

**252**

560 of 1925

Saka 1131, Pushya, su. 11, Sunday, Uttarayana-samkranti.

Irregular. Neither in Saka 1131 current nor in Saka 1131 expired did Pushya, su. 11 fall on a Sunday ; it was also not a day of Uttarayana-samkranti. In Saka 1131 expired the Uttarayana-samkranti occurred on ba. 12 of Pushya. If this was the intended date the equivalent would be A.D. 1209, December 25, Friday.

**254**

204 of 1905

Saka 1131, Sukla, Magha, su. 2, Wednesday

= A.D. 1209, December 30, Wednesday ; '39.

**256**

88 of 1917

Saka 1133, Paushya, ba. 15, Sunday.

In Pushya both of Saka 1133 current and Saka 1133 expired ba. 15 did not fall on a Sunday. If ba. 15 is a mistake for ba. 5 the equivalent would be A.D. 1211, December 25, Sunday on which day the 5^(th) *tithi* commenced at 5 hours 45 minutes after sunrise.

**257**

324 of 1915

Saka 1133, Magha, su. 7, Thursday

= A.D. 1212, January 12, Thursday ; '67.

**258**

271 of 1905

Saka 1134, Angirasa, Karttika, su. 15, Sunday, lunar eclipse = A.D. 1212, November 10, Saturday on which day there was a lunar eclipse and the *tithi* ended at 15 hours 50 minutes after sunrise. Sunday is evidently a mistake for Saturday.

**260**

79 of 1917

Saka 1135, Vaisakha, su. 10, Mondlay.

Both in current and expired Saka year 1135, Vaisakha, su. 10 did not fall on a Monday. In the latter year the *tithi* fell on a Wednesday *viz.,* A.D. 1213, May 1. Somavara is probably a mistake for Saumyavara. Or if Saka 1135 is a mistake for Saka 1136 which is more
likely the equivalent would be A.D. 1214, April 21, Monday on which day *dasam* ended at 6 hours 15 minutes after sunrise.

**261**

717 of 1920

Saka 1136, Bhava, Karttika, su. 8, Sunday

= A.D. 1214, October 12, Sunday ; '87.

**262**

723 of 1920

Saka 1140, Sreshtha, su. 15.

Probably = A.D. 1218, June 10, Sunday. The details are not enough for verification.

**263**

331 of 1915

Saka 1140, Uttarayana-samkranti.

Probably = A.D. 1218, December 26, Wednesday. Details are not enough for verification.

**264**

851 of 1917

Saka 1142, Vikrama, Chaitra, ba. 15, Thursday, Vishu-samkranti.

In Vikrama, Chaitra ba. 15 was not a Thursday nor did the Vishu-samkranti occur on that day but in the next year *i.e.* Vrisha, Chaitra, ba. 15 was not only a Thursday but a day of Vishu-samkranti.
This latter appears to be the intended date (= A.D. 1221, March 25, Thursday ; '46).

**265**

188 of 1917

Saka 114\[2\], Vrisha, Karttika.

Vrisha was either Saka 1143 expired or 1144 current = A.D. 1221-22.

**266**

237 of 1905

Vyaya, Karttika, su. 15, Vaddavara, lunar eclipse

= A.D. 1226, November 5, Thursday ; '79. But there was no lunar eclipse on that day. The grant might have been actually made on the day of the lunar eclipse which occurred on Sunday, the 9^(th) August but recorded on the day cited in the inscription.

**267**

174 of 1917

Saka 1143, Chaitra, su. 15.

Probably = A.D. 1221, March 9, Tuesday. Details are not enough for verification.

140 of 1917

Saka 1144, Chaitra, su. 10, Monday.

Neither in Saka 1144, current nor expired, Chaitra, su. 10 fell on a Monday.

456 of 1915

Saka 1145, Uttarayana-samkranti.

Probably = A.D. 1222, December 26, Tuesday. Details are not enough for verification.

**271**

330 of 1915

Saka 1145, Uttarayana-samkranti.

Probably = A.D. 1222, December 26, Tuesday. Details are not enough for verification.

**273**

325 of 1924

Saka 1150, Sarvvadhari

= A.D. 1228-29.

**274**

275 of 1924

Saka 115\[2\], Tarana, Vaisakha, su. 1, Thursday.

The cyclic year Tarana was Saka 1146 (expired). In this year the given details do not agree but in the next year Parthiva, Vaisakha su. 1 fell on a Thursday = A.D. 1225, April 10.

**279**

60 of 1917

Saka 115\[3\], Magha, su. 5, Thursday

= A.D. 1232, January 29, Thursday.

**282**

134 of 1917

Saka 115\[7 ?\], Vaisakha, su, 3, Thursday.

Neither in Saka 1157 current nor expired, Vaisakha, su. 3 was a Thursday but in Saka 1158 (expired) it was = A.D. 1236, April 10, Thursday. But the correct reading of the Saka year is 1152 = A.D. 1229, March 29, Thursday. (See Appendix II).

**283**

278-a of 1905

Sake 1157, Manmatha, Marggasira, ba. 2, Wednesday

Neither in Saka 1158 current nor expired was Chaitra, su. 6, a Wednesday but it was in Saka 1159 = A.D. 1237, March 4, Wednesday. This is probably the intended date.

**287**

278-b of 1905

Hemalambi, Karttika, su. 15, Wednesday.

If the Saka year is taken to be 1159 the equivalent would be = A.D. 1237, November 4, Wednesday ; '24.

**288**

63 of 1917

Saka 1160, Uttarayana-samkranti.

Probably = A.D. 1238, March 25, Thursday ; '05.

**303**

466 of 1915

Saka 1167, Visvavasu, Ashadha, su.

Details are not enough for calculation. Saka 1167 expired was Visvavasu = A.D.D. 1245-46.

**304**

245 of 1905

Saka 1177 (mistake for 1167), Visvavasu, Pushya, su. Tuesday. Probably = A.D. 1245, December 26, Tuesday. Since there is space for only one figure the *tithi* was very likely su. 6.

**305**

235 of 1905

Saka 1168, Parabhava, Chaitra, su. 6, Sunday, Vishu-samkranti

= A.D. 1246, March 25, Sunday ; but su. 6 had ended on the previous day at 14 hours after sunrise ; 6 is probably a mistake for 7 as correctly given in No. 308.

**306**

234 of 1905

Saka 1168, Parabhava, Chaitra, su. 6, Sunday, Vishu-samkranti

= A.D. 1246, March 25, Sunday ; but su. 6 had ended on the previous day at 14 hours after sunrise ; 6 is probably a mistake for 7 as correctly given in No. 308.

Saka 1168, Parabhava, Chaitra, su. 7, Sunday, Vaishu-samkranti

= A.D. 1246, March 25, Sunday

**310**

138 of 1917

Saka 1168, Paushya, lsu. 5, Thursday, Makara-samkranti.

In Saka 1168 expired the Makara-samkranti did not take place either on the *tithi* or on the week day cited here. In Saka 1168 current the samkranti occurred on Paushya su. 5 but the week day was Monday. If this is regarded as a mistake the equivalent would be A.D. 1245, December 25, Monday ; '40.

**311**

241 of 1905

Sake 1168, Parabhava, Paushya, ba. 3, Wednesday, Makara-samkranti

**320**

405 of 1915

Saka, 1170, Kilaka, Paushya, su. 10, Monday, Uttarayana-samkranti.

In Saka 1170 expired, Paushya su. 10 fell on a Sunday, not Monday and Uttarayna-samkranti took place on the previous Saturday. If Monday is a mistake for Sunday the equivalent would be A.D. 1248, December 27, Sunday. The grant was made probably on the occasion of the samkranti and put on stone the next day.

**321**

559 of 1925

Saka 1170, Kilaka, Magha, ba. 14, Friday

= A.D. 1249, February 12, Friday ; f.d.t. '21.

555 of 1925

Saka 1171, Ashadha, su. 14, Sunday

249 of 1905

Saka 1171, Saumya, Uttarayana-samkranti.

= A.D. 1250, October 20, Thursday ; '45. The month was Nija-Asvayuja.

**332**

283 of 1905

Saka 1175, Sadharana (?) Pushya, su. 5, Thursday, Makara-samkranti.

The cyclic year Sadharana corresponded to Saka 1172 ; but the Makara-samkranti in that year did not occur on Pushya su. 5. In Saka 1175 (Pramadin), however, the given details correspond regularly to A.D. 1253, December 25, Thursday, on which day the samkranti and the *tithi* commenced at '79. The Saka or the cyclic year cited appears,
therefore, to be a mistake.

**333**

=A.D. 1250, December 26, Monday.
