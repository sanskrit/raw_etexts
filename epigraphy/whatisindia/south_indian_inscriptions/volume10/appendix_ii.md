**APPENDIX II**

Additions and corrections

by

**N. Lakshminarayan Rao, m.a.,**

\[As the contents of some of the inscriptions in this volume as read by the late Mr. Ramayya Pantulu, the editor, were found to differ in some respects from their brief English summaries as embodied in the *Annual Reports on South Indian Epigraphy* it became necessary to verify Mr. Pantuluâ€™s readings of such records with their impressions. The corrections suggested here â€“ except of the typographical and other minor errors â€“ related mainly to these inscriptions.\]

On the impression the first three digits of the Sake year *viz.* 108 are clear and the last digit may be read as 7. So the date of this record would be Saka 108\[7\], for which year the details cited regularly correspond to A. D. 1165, March 22, Monday ; f.d.t. â€™09. Consequently the Rajaraja of this record must be Rajaraja II of the Imperial Cholas

These two records belong to the early Chalukyas of Badami and should, strictly speaking, have preceded No. 2. As between the two, No. 24 should precede No.23 in as much as the 27^(th) year of reign quoted for Vikramaditya in the former *viz.,* No.24 indicates the king as the predecessor of Vijayaditya of No. 23 and not as his successor who reigned only for about 14 years.

Though the third digit of the saka year in line 3 looks like zero, the impression clearly shows that it has been corrected into some other digit which cannot be made out with any certainty. As the known dates of this chief Nanni-Choda range from Saka 1073 to 10\[7\] 9 (See Nos. 646 and 651 of *S. I. I.,* Vol. VI), the intended date may be Saka 1072 or 1082.

This is a record of the Velanandu chief Rajendra Choda II, son of Kulotltunga-Choda-Gonka (II). His dates range from Saka 1085 to Saka 1102 and so this record cannot come before No. 99 which bears the date Saka 1059.

The dates for Kota Ganapati range from Saka 1180 to Saka 1185. So this must follow No. 400 which is dated Saka 118\[5\].

These numbers of uncertain dates are placed between No.373 which bears the Saka date 1182 and No.391 which bears the Saka date 1183 without assigning any reason. Of these No. 380 mentions a Kota Ketaraja. The Kota chiefs Keta II and Keta III were contemporaries of Kakatiya Ganapati in the early part of his reign, the latest date available for the latter of them (*viz.* Keta III) being A.D. 1240
