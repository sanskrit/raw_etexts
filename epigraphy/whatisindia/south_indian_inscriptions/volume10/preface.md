**Preface**

The earlier volumes of the South Indian Inscriptions Series, which contain the texts of a large number of Tamil, Telugu and Kannada inscriptions have been long out of print and many academic institutions of recent origin keenly feel the absence of these very important volumes in their libraries. It has therefore been decided to reprint those volumes and make them available to the world of scholars. Volume X is the seventh of this Reprint Series and will be followed in quick succession by the subsequent ones.

I wish to register my thanks to Dr. M.S. Nagaraja Rao, Director General, Archaeological Survey of India whose abiding interest in the promotion of epigraphical studies has enabled the implementation of this long awaited reprint scheme. The credit for the planning and speedy execution of the printing work goes to Shri J.C. Gupta, Production Officer, Archaeological Survey of India, New Delhi.
