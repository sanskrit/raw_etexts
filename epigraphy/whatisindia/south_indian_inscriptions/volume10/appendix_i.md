18th year of Rajaraja, (Saka . . . ) Chaitra, su. 9, Monday.

If this belongs to the reign of the Chola-Chalukya Rajaraja-Narendra I, the equivalent would be A.D. 1040, March 24, Monday ; f. d. t. 20.

579 of 1925

Saka 1034, Chitrbhanu, Paushya, ba . . , Thursday.

Saka 1037, Jaya, Chaitra, solar eclipse.

**73**

**&**

**74**

316 of 1915

and
