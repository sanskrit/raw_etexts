**APPENDIX II**

Additions and corrections

by

**N. Lakshminarayan Rao, m.a.,**

\[As the contents of some of the inscriptions in this volume as read by the late Mr. Ramayya Pantulu, the editor, were found to differ in some respects from their brief English summaries as embodied in the *Annual Reports on South Indian Epigraphy* it became necessary to verify Mr. Pantuluâ€™s readings of such records with their impressions. The corrections suggested here â€“ except of the typographical and other minor errors â€“ related mainly to these inscriptions.\]

In the absence of the same Chola or of any known ruler of the Chola family it does not seem proper to consider this inscription as a Chola record. The late Rai Bahadur Venkayya was inclined to take the king Srivallabha of the record as a Chalukya.
