SOUTH INDIAN INSCRIPTIONS

VOLUME XIII

**INSCRIPTIONS OF RAJAKESARIVARMAN**

**No. 201.**

**(A.R. No. 382 of 1924.)**

**Melappaluvur, Udaiyarpalaiyam Taluk, Trichinopoly District.**

**On the south wall of the Cholesvara shrine, Agastyesvara temple.**

This records an agreement given by seven temple servants (talippattudaiyar) to burn a perpetual lamp in the shrine on the north side of the temple of Mahadeva of Avanigandharvva-Isvara-griham, a *devadana* in Kunrak-kurram with the interest of ten *kalanju* of gold now received by them from the two (classes of) *nagarattar* with whom the amount had been originally deposited by the donor, **Virasola Anukkan Siriyappi Malapadi** of Avanigandarvvapuram in the 1\[6\]th year of Parakesarivarman Uttama-Chola in the regime of **Adigal Paluvettaraiyar Kandan Maravanar.** At the time of the transfer of this amount the administration of the temple is said to have been vested with one Kausikan Nakkan Marapiran. The inscription may be assigned to **Rajaraja I.**

**No. 202.**

**(A.R. No. 209 of 1926.)**

**Sendalai, Tanjore Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On the south wall of the central shrine, Sundaresvara temple.**

The inscription records a gift of 2 shares (of land) after purchasing them from two members of the alunganam of the village Chandralekai-chaturvedimangalam Irayur Narayana-Batta Dasapuriya and Kuravasiri Echcha (Yajna) Kumara Dasapuriya, and getting them made tax-free by the sabha, by a certain Kodai-Pavitram for providing for the expenses of the festival in the temple of god Tirupperundurai-Perumanadigal. As the script employed in this inscription is of the same early variety as that of No. 310 of the 24th year of Rajakesarivarman published below, which has been assigned to Adiya I, this may also be attributed to that king.

**No. 203.**

**(A.R. No. 238 of 1927.)**

**Ammangudi, Kumbakonam Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On a stone-mortar kept in the Lakshminarayana-Perumal Temple.**

This consists of a number of fragments which should have originally formed part of a complete inscription. It seems to record the re-construction of a temple or shrine under the name Tiruvaiyotti (Ayodhya) to Ramadevapperumal, and consecration of the image of the deity therein, and an endowment of land for offerings, worship and lamps to the god and for a flower-garden by the ganapperumakkal (of the village). This is an inscription of Rajaraja I.

**No. 204.**

**(A.R. No. 126 of 1929.)**

**Lalgudi, Lalgudi Taluk, Trichinopoly District.**

**On the north wall of the central shrine, Saptarishisvara temple.**

This records the sale of quarter veli and odd of land, free of taxes, to the temple of Mahadeva at Tiruttavatturai in Idaiyarru-nadu by the sabha of Nityavinitamangalam, a brahmadeya in the same nadu, for 15 kalanju of gold which was endowed for a perpetual lamp in the temple by a certain Puvalsayanganam-Udaiyan.

**No. 205.**

**(A.R. No. 483 of 1904.)**

**Vedaranyam, Tirutturaipundi Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On a pillar in the mandapa in front of Ramanathesvara shrine, Vedaranesvara temple.**

This records a gift of 90 sheep by Pullunjiru-Nambi a merchant of Arimukkapuram in Malai-nadu, for a perpetual lamp in the temple of Tirumaraikkattalvar. The temple servants (devaridaichchanrar) who received the sheep agreed to supply an ulakku of ghee by the measure Tirumaraikkadan every day for the purpose.

**No. 206.**

**(A.R. No. 383 of 1913.)**

**Erumbur, Chidambaram Taluk, South Arcot District.**

**On the south wall of the central shrine, Kadambavanesvara temple.**

This records a gift of a lamp-stand and 90 sheep for burning a lamp in the temple of Siru-Tirukkoyil-Mahadeva at Urmur, a devadana in Nalvayalur-kurram, by Kurumban Sirugan of Villangattur in Arumbur-kurram (a subdivision) of Pandi-nadu. The gift was entrusted to the sabha of the village. This is possibly an inscription of Sundara-Chola.

**(A.R. No. 356 of 1918.)**

**Palur, Trichinopoly Taluk, Trichinopoly District.**

**On the south wall of the central shrine, Sundaresvara temple.**
