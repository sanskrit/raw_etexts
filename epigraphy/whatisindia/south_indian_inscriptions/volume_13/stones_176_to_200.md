SOUTH INDIAN INSCRIPTIONS

VOLUME XIII

**INSCRIPTIONS OF RAJAKESARIVARMAN**

**No. 176.**

**(A.R. No. 172 of 1907.)**

**Tiruppalatturai, Trichinopoly Taluk, Trichinopoly District.**

**On the west wall of the central shrine, Adimulesvara temple.**

This inscription is much damaged. It seems to register a grant of land made by Sendampunagi, the wife of Kachchuvan Madhavan to provide for the sacred bath of God Paramesvara at Tiruppatturai on the days of *Sankranti*. Among the boundaries of the land is mentioned a channel called Uttamasili-vaykkal. Probably a record of **Gandaraditya.**

**No. 177.**

**(A.R. No. 176 of 1907.)**

**On the north wall of the same shrine.**

This is also probably an inscription of Gandaraditya. It registers an endowment of land by Tappildaram Pallavaraiyan alias Kilmattur Paruvur, an officer of prince Arikulakesarideva for offerings and worship to the deity at Tiruppanambudur which formed part of Uttamasili-chaturvedimangalam, a brahmadeya village on the southern bank (of the river). It is the same as No. 570 of 1908 which is published in South Indian Inscriptions, Volume III, No. 111.

**No. 178.**

**(A.R. No. 564 of 1908.)**

**On the south wall of the same shrine.**

This inscription is damaged. It records a gift of 45 kalanju of gold for burning a perpetual lamp and a day-lamp in the temple by Balasiriyan Narayanan Jana\[rdana\] of Uttamasili-chaturvedimangalam.

**No. 179.**

**(A.R. No. 567 of 1908.)**

**On the west wall of the same shrine.**

This inscription is identical with No. 176 above.

**No. 180.**

**(A.R. No. 570 of 1908.)**

**On the north wall of the same shrine.**

This inscription is identical with No. 177 above.

**No. 181.**

**(A.R. No. 574 of 1908.)**

**On the same wall.**

This is also probably an inscription of Gandaraditya like No. 177 above, and records an agreement given by the perunguri-sabhai of Uttamasili-chaturvedimangalam making tax-free for a lump-amount of 10 kasu received by them from Tappildaram-Pallavaraiyan, one ma and odd of land belonging to the temple of Paramesvara at Tiruppanambudur.

Text.

Published in South Indian Inscriptions, Volume III, No. 112.

**No. 182.**

**(A.R. No. 683 of 1909.)**

**Tirunedungalam, Trichinopoly Taluk, Trichinopoly District.**

**On the south wall of the ganesa shrine, Nedungalanathasvamin temple.**

The inscription registers a sale of land as kudinikka-devadana by the sabha, the ur and the devakarmis of the temple at Tirunedungalam, a devadana in Kavira-nadu, for 30 kasu received by them as karpura-vilai for the temple, to Kamban Maniyan, the headman of Suralur, with the stipulation that after clearing the forest and reclaiming the land he was to pay 150 kalam of paddy annually as kanikkadan to the temple. The land was to be irrigated by the same stream called Kumiliyaru which also irrigated the temple lands. Mention is made of a certain standard grain-measure (urkkal) called Kodukulavan. The characters belong to about the 10th century A.D., and from the reference made in it to the officer Rajaraja-Brahmamaraya, the record may be assigned to Rajaraja I. Tiruvelpur (Tirugokarnam) of No. 174 above was also in Kavira-nadu.

**No. 183.**

**(A.R. No. 347 of 1918.)**

**Palur, Trichinopoly Taluk, Trichinopoly District.**

**On the north wall of the central shrine, Sundaresvara temple.**
