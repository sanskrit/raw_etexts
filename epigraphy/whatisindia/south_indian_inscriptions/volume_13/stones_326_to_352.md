SOUTH INDIAN INSCRIPTIONS

VOLUME XIII

**INSCRIPTIONS OF RAJAKESARIVARMAN**

**No. 326.**

**(A.R. No. 316 of 1904.)**

**Kudumiyamalai, Pudukkottai State.**

**On a pillar of the rock-cut shrine, Melaikkoyil Temple.**

This inscription is damaged. It records an endowment of money for burning a lamp in the temple of Tirumulattanattur-Perumanadigal at Tirunilakunram in Kunriyur-nadu by a certain **Kavisiyan Peruman.**

**No. 327.**

**(A.R. No. 330 of 1904.)**

**On the north face of the south pillar in the same rock-cut shrine.**

**On the north wall of the central shrine, Vaidyanatha temple.**

This records and endowment of 4 kalanju of gold for burning a lamp throughout the day-time in the temple at Tirunilakkunram in Kunriyur-nadu, on behalf of a person called Sendan-Nakkan. The name of the donor is lost.

**No. 328.**

**(A.R. No. 604 of 1904.)**

**Srinivasanallur, Musiri Taluk, Trichinopoly District.**

**On a stone built into the floor of the Visvanathasvamin temple.**

This is a fragmentary inscription which seems to record the provision made by order of the king for burning a perpetual lamp before god PallikondarulukinraPerumanadigal (Ranganatha). This stone is obviously from elsewhere.

**No. 329.**

**(A.R. No. 600 of 1904.)**

**On the south wall of the Pattabhiramasvami shrine, in the same temple.**

The inscription is damaged. It seems to record an endowment of 18 Â½ kalanju of gold by the standard weight called pachchirkal left by Niliyar a lady resident of Tottiyam, in charge of the assembly of the village, who set apart some land in return as archana-bhoga out of which the daily offerings to the god were to be provided for. The assembly is said to have consisted of 48 members.

**No. 330.**

**(A.R. No. 325 of 1906.)**

**Tirumalpuram, Arkonam Taluk, North Arcot District.**

**On the west wall of the central shrine, ruined Vishnu temple.**

This records a gift of sheep for a lamp in the temple of Perumanadigal at Govindapadi in Valla-nadu, a subdivision of Damark-kottam, by Arangan Ka\[ru\]nakaran alias Tennavan-Muvendavelan of Kulamangalam in \[A\]mbar-nadu. This donor is evidently different from Adittan Suryan of Poygai-nadu an important person of thetime of Rajaraja I, who had the same title (S.I.I. II. Intr. P. 11).

**No. 331.**

**(A.R. No. 326 of 1907.)**

**Tiruvisalur, Kumbakonam Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On the north wall of the central shrine, Sivayoganathasvamin temple.**

This is merely an unfinished fragment.

**No. 332.**

**(A.R. No. 297 of 1908.)**

**Tirukkalittattai, Kumbakonam Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On the west wall of the central shrine, Vedapurisvara temple.**

This records the gift of a silver pot for thesacred bath of god Srikudittittai-Mahadeva at Vembarrur by Sembiyan-Mahadevi-Pirattiyar the mother of Uttama-Chola. The inscription is evidently one of Rajaraja I.

**No. 333.**

**(A.R. No. 446 of 1908.)**

**Tiruvilimilalai, Nannilam Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On the first pillar in the inner gopura, Vilinathasvamin temple, right of entrance.**

This is below an inscription of the 12th year of Rajaraja I and seems to be connected with it. A portion to its right is chiseled off. It states that the garden-land given (by the assembly of Malalai) to a temple servant, which had been dry on account of the low level of water, was to get facilities for irrigation from a tank (near by ?)
