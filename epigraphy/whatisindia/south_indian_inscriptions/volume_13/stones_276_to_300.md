SOUTH INDIAN INSCRIPTIONS

VOLUME XIII

**INSCRIPTIONS OF RAJAKESARIVARMAN**

**No. 276.**

**(A.R. No. 561 of 1920.)**

**Udayargudi (near Kattumannarkoyil), Chidambaram Taluk,**

**South Arcot District.**

**On the south wall of the central shrine, Anantisvarasvamin temple.**

This records the gift of a lamp-stand and an endowment of land for burning a perpetual lamp in the temple of Tiruvanantisvarattu-Paramasvami at Viranarayana-chaturvedimangalam, by **Adittan Battalakan** of Adumbantittai in Idaiyala-nadu. An inscription probably of **Sundara-Chola.**

**No. 277.**

**(A.R. No. 230 of 1923.)**

**Koyil-Tevarayanpettai (near Pandaravadai),**

**Papanasam Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On the north wall of the central shrine, Matsyapurisvara temple.**

This records an agreement given by three servants of the temple to supply ghee for a perpetual lamp in the temple, and paddy for those bringing water for the sacred bath of the deity from the Kaveri, in return for the sheep and cows and money received by them at various times in the reign of \[Madirai\]konda-Marayar including his 19th year. Probably this might refer to the reigning king himself, the Rajakesari of the record being equated with Sundara-Chola Parantaka II. It is however not known that he had a reign of 19 years ; neither is it clear how that later regnal year could be referred to here except by some mistake. Mention is made of a quarter called Solachulamanichcheri, evidently after a surname of the ruler.

**No. 278.**

**(A.R. No. 237 of 1923.)**

**On the same wall.**

This records an agreement given by Kamakkani Nakkan Tri\[ya\*\]mbaka-Bhattan, a servant of the temple to supply a certain quantity of oil daily for lamps in the temple of Tiruchchelur-Mahadeva, for which he had received money from the temple in the 14th and 15th years of â€˜Maharaya who took Maduraâ€™, and from a person named Nahesvara-Kramavittan in the 12th year of the same king, with personal security in each case. â€˜Maharayar who took Maduraâ€™ is evidently the reigning king, and the record is to be referred to Sundara-Chola Parantaka II.

**No. 279.**

**(A.R. No. 387 of 1924.)**

**Melappaluvur, Udaiyarpalaiyam Taluk, Trichinopoly District.**

**On the north wall of the Cholesvara shrine, Agastyesvara temple.**

This records the gift of a lamp-stand and 10 kalanju of gold for burning a perpetual lamp in the temple of Mahadeva at Avanigandharvapura a devadana in Kunrakurram, by Virasola-Anukkan Gunavan Dharanivallabhan a resident of the village, who deposited the money with the seven pattudaiyar (persons who had the right of worship) in the temple. Probably a record of Sundara-Chola.

**No. 280.**

**(A.R. No. 149 of 1931.)**

**Tiruchchatturai, Tanjore Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On the north wall of the central shrine, Odanavanesvara temple.**

This records a gift of 100 sheep for a perpetual lamp in the temple of Mahadeva at Tiruchchorrutturai by the Chola queen (name not given). The patipadamula and the devakanmi (servants) of the temple agreed to maintain the lamp. This is probably a record of Sundara-Chola.

**No. 281.**

**(A.R. No. 157 of 1931.)**

**On the west wall of the same shrine.**

The inscription is damaged. It registers an endowment of 20 kalanju for a lamp in the temple by Gunavan Puttan who left it in charge of the temple servants (patipadamula). The donor has figured in No. 273 above and in another inscription (No. 348) published below. This is probably a record of Aditya I.

**No. 281A.**

**(A.R. No. 18 of 1934.)**

**Chintamani, Ponneri Taluk, Chingleput District.**

**On a pillar in the ardha-mandapa, Chintamanisvara temple.**

This is an inscription of â€˜Rajakesarivarman who took Maduraâ€™, i.e., of Sundara-Chola Parantaka II, and is dated in the last year of his rule. It states that one Kuditangi-Battalakan purchased land from the assembly of the (group of ?) three villages, Karungali, Kandal-nallur and Kandarpaga, and presented it free of all taxes to the temple of Mahadeva at Tiruppagavanrurai (evidently the present Chintamani) â€œwhich is an sacred on the Eastern Sea as Gokarna is on the Westâ€?. The tenants of this land were to supply annually to the temple 10 nali of oil on every half  
site of land occupied by them. The nattar of Paiyur-nadu together with others were charged with the protection of this sacred trust. This and the  
nextinscription are important as coming from the northern most region of the Chola dominion of the period.
