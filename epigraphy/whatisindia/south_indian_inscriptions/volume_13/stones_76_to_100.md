**(A.R. No. 80 of 1934.)**

**Amur, Chingleput Taluk, Chingleput District.**

Kumanan.

D. 989, June 13, when Hasta commenced at 25 of day. The record is therefore one of Rajaraja I.

**(A.R. No. 320 of 1907.)**

**On the same wall.**

This states that Pirantakan Irungolar alias Siriyavelar paid 130 Ilakkasu to the assembly of Amaninarayana-chaturvedimangalam for exempting from taxes, a quarter veli and odd of land endowed by him for the midday offerings in the temple of Tiruvisalur-Perumanadigal.

**(A.R. No. 263 of 1910.)**

**On the north base of the central shrine, Varaha-Perumal temple.**

This inscription records an agreement of the Uravar of Paduvur in paduvur-nadu, a subdivision of Amur-kottam, to supply 90 nali of oil per year calculated at an ulakku a day, for burning a perpetual lamp in the temple of Srivarahadevar at Tiruvidavandai, a devadana in the same nadu, in lieu of interest on 20 kalanju of gold endowed and left with them by Duggayyan Sattan of Purushottama-mangalam in Valluva-nadu (a subdivision) of Malai-nadu.

**Tiruverumbur, Trichinopoly Taluk, Trichinopoly District.**

**On the west wall of the central shrine, Pipilikesvara temple.**

This records an endowment of 10 kalanju of gold made by Sendan Seyyavayamani, a servant (or dancing girl) of the Tiruvarangam temple, to the temple of Tenkailayattu-Mahadeva at Srikantha-chaturvedimangalam for burning a twilight lamp in the temple, and to provide for the daily supply of a pot of water to the temple from the river for the sacred bath of the deity. The temple servants (upasakas) accepted the gift and made themselves responsible for the obligation. It is possible that this is a record of Aditya I as it is engraved above No. 115 of 1914 which belongs to Parantaka I, and as its alphabet is also early.

**No. 89.**

**(A.R. No. 430 of 1918.)**

**Tirukkurugavur, Shiyali Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On the west wall of the central shrine, Velvidainatha temple.**

The same donor is mentioned also in No. 433 of 1918, a record of the 15th year of Parakesarivarman from the same place, under the title Uttamasola-Muvendavelar. This is probably an inscription of Parantaka II Sundara-Chola.

**No. 90.**

**(A.R. No. 538 of 1920.)**

**Udayargudi (near Kattumannarkoyil), Chidambaram Taluk, South Arcot District.**

**No. 91.**

**(A.R. No. 560 of 1920.)**

**On the same wall.**

This records an endowment of land by Uttaman Chandran alias Sembiyan Pallavadarayan of Pattam in Avur-kurram on the southern bank (of the river) for the daily feeding of three Brahmans in the temple at midday. The land is stated to have been purchased for the purpose from Kasyapan Yajnan Sattan, the headman of Devan-mangalam in Merka-nadu. The details of the provision required for each meal are given.

**No. 92.**

**(A.R. No. 562 of 1920.)**

**On the same wall.**

This records the endowment tax-free, of Kappuveli the eastern hamlet of their village, and the land round about the temple with all the appurtenances, by the Perunguri-perumakkal (assembly) of Viranarayana-chaturvedimangalam for offerings to the deity during the three services in the temple of Tiruvanantisvarattu-Paramasvami. The assembly is said to have met in the temple of Viranarayana-Vinnagar. The date of the inscription, 4th year, Kumbha, Tuesday, Uttiradam, corresponds to A. D. 952, January 27, though the details are not enough for verification. The inscription may therefore be assigned to Gandaraditya.

**No. 93.**

**(A.R. No. 580 of 1920.)**

**On the west wall of the same shrine.**

The inscription is much worn out. It registers an order of the Perumakkal (assembly) who â€˜looked after the gramakaryam for the year from the month of Mithunaâ€™, and who are said to have consisted of 120 members, giving a plot of land in exchange for the one below the Kilinalur tank which had been already endowed for the daily offerings and worship to the deity by the Perungurip-perumakkal (assembly), but which, not having been enjoyed, had been otherwise utilized by them subsequently. An inscription of either Gandaraditya or Sundara-Chola.

**No. 94.**

**(A.R. No. 530 of 1921.)**

**No. 95.**

**(A.R. No. 444 of 1922.)**

**Kayar, Chingleput Taluk, Chingleput District.**

**On a stone near the Kamalanarayana-Perumal image in the village.**

This is an incomplete inscription recording an endowment of land, tax-free, for burning a perpetual lamp in the temple of Urudaip-Perumal Tirumerralideva, by Kandan Pudi, the head man of a village (name lost) in Sonadu.

**No. 96.**

**(A.R. No. 445 of 1922.)**

**On another stone in the same place.**

A portion of the inscription at the end is lost. This records an endowment of land at Kayar in Kumili-nadu, a subdivision of Amur-kottam, by Arinjoman, the headman of Anaichchur in Tirunaraiyur-nadu, a subdivision of Sonadu, to provide for the sribali offerings in the temple of Urudaip-Perumal Tirumerralideva at the village. It also records another gift of land for the expense of the tiruchchennadai (procession) of the god. Both these lands are stated to have been made tax-free by the sabha of the village with whom they were left, evidently in consideration of a lump sum deposit.

**No. 97.**

**(A.R. No. 419 of 1923.)**

**Venpakkam, Conjeeveram Taluk, Chingleput District.**

**On a slab set up in the village.**

This records the construction of a sluice by Keralan Rajadittan alias Nani Vichchadara (Vidyadhara) marayan who had the jivita of Velakkon-mangalam in Kunra-nadu, a subdivision of Urrukkattuk-kottam. His names suggest that he was possibly a person of high musical attainments which accounted for his jivita, probably at the hands of prince Rajaditya.

**No. 98.**

**(A.R. No. 394 of 1924.)**

**Melappaluvur, Udaiyarpalayam Taluk, Trichinopoly District.**

**On the west wall of the Minakshiyamman Shrine, Sundaresvara temple.**

This states that Adigal Paluvettaraiyar Kandan Maravan of Mannupperum-Paluvur in Kunra-kurram, who founded the temple of Tiruttottamudaiyar at the village, granted the right of worship in the temple to Ilangodi Suryan a share-holder in Tiruchchiruvalandai on the suggestion of Kavisikan Nakkan Maran, the supervisor of the temple, while he was staying at Senapuram in Maladu. As this chief also figures in No. 395 of 1924 in the reign of Uttama-Chola, it is probable that the Rajakesarivarman of this record refers to Rajaraja I.

**No. 99.**

**(A.R. No. 117 of 1926.)**

**Tiruvilakkudi, Mayavaram Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On the north wall of the central shrine, Manavalesvara temple.**

**No. 100.**

**Innambur, Kumbakonam Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On a stone built into the mandapa in front of the central shrine, Aksharapurisvara temple.**

This is an incomplete inscription recording the construction of a Vishnu temple by Satti Arinjigai alias Tennavan Vilupparaiyan after his own name at Innambar in Innambar-nadu, and some provision (details lost) made by him to feed five Brahmanas in the temple every day after offerings to the deity.
