**No. 51.**

**(A.R. No. 129 of 1914.)**

**Tiruverumbur, Trichinopoly Taluk, Trichinopoly District.**

**On the south wall of the central shrine, Pipilikesvara temple.**

The inscription registers another sale of land, made tax-free, at Srikantha-chaturvedimangalam by the assembly (Perunguir-sabhai) of the village to **Velan Viranaranan** *alias* **Sembiyan Vedivelar of Sirudavur who is stated to have constructed the Srivimana** to (god) Tiruverumbiyur-Alvar. This person, after paying the cost of the land as well as a lump sum towards its tax-exemption, and also redeeming it from a certain resident of the village named Mappani Kari Nakkan in whose charge the land had been left by the assembly (evidently in mortgage), endowed the land for the maintenance of our persons who were to sing the *Tiruppadiyam* hymns to the accompaniment of *udukkai* and *talam* daily during the tree services in the temple. The donor is also said to have added to this land, another piece which had been the object of a boundary dispute (*sima-vivadam)* between the residents of Srikantha-chaturvedimangalam and Tiruverumbiyr, and which he had purchased from both the parties (See No. 50 above). The inscription refers to a channel dug by the donor. This is evidently the one mentioned in No. 50 above.

**No. 52.**

The record seems to belong to Rajaraja I.

This records an additional endowment of a land after its reclamation, to the temple at Tiruttavatturai in Idaiyaru-nadu by Sivagochari-Pidaran Desavidangan, a Pattudaiyan of the temple, as a previous gift made by him for the maintenance of two hymnists for singing the Tiruppadiyam was found inadequate. The donees were to receive the sevvaram share on these lands while the sirukudivaram was to be paid to the temple in the shape of oil (for lamps). As the previous gift referred to here is evidently the one mentioned in No. 99 of 1929, dated in the 37th year of Parantaka I, it is probable that this record is one of his successor Gandaraditya, though it is attributed to Sundara-Chola for this same reason in M.E.R. for 1929, Part II, Para 2.

**No. 75.**

**(A.R. No. 110 of 1929.)**
