SOUTH INDIAN INSCRIPTIONS

VOLUME XIII

**INSCRIPTIONS OF RAJAKESARIVARMAN**

**No. 26.**

**(*A. R*. *No.* 597 *of* 1904.)**

**Srinivasanallur, Musiri Taluk, Trichinopoly District.**

**On the north wall of the Korangunathan temple.**

This inscription is damaged and a portion of it in the middle is lost. This registers a sale of land as a tax-free *devadana* by the members of the *Mulaparishad* of **Mahendramangalam** to the temple of Tirukkurakkutturai-Perumanadigal. Among the signatories occurs the name of a certain Sekharan Sattan of Korramangalam, who is referred to as (a member) of the **Manigramam** (mercantile guild) of Ra\[jakesa\]ripuram in Mala-nadu.

**No. 27.**

**(A.R. No. 518 of 1905.)**

**Tiruvellarai, Trichinopoly Taluk, Trichinopoly District.**

**On the rock in front of the Jambunatha temple.**

The date of this inscription has been read in the M.E.R. for 1906 as 3\[0\]. The letters look more and this seems to be the correct reading, since we have not come across a date later than the 27th year for any king bearing the mere name Rajakesarivarman.

This records an endowment of 70 kalanju of gold left in charge of the Mulaparishad of Tiruvellarai by Sattuvay Kanjan Damodiran, a resident of the village, for feeding a Brahmana versed in the Vedas, every noon after offering in the temple of Tiruvanaikkal-Perumanadigal.

**No. 28.**

**(A.R. No. 519 of 1905.)**

**On the same rock.**

This records another endowment of money made by a member of the Manigramam of Uraiyur for a similar purpose.

**No. 29.**

**(A.R. No. 285 of 1906.)**

**Tirumalpuram, Arkonam Taluk, North Arcot District.**

**On the west wall of the central shrine, Manikanthesvara temple.**

This records an endowment of 15 kalanju of gold by Madhurantakan Gandaradittan for the daily supply of an ulakku of oil for a lamp in the temple of Tirumalperralvar, to be made by the urar (assembly) of Serugur in Valla-nadu, a division of Damar-kottam, in whose charge the amount was left by the donor. The inscription of evidently one of Rajaraja I since the donor largely figures in the other records of this king.

**No. 30.**

**(A.R. No. 292-A of 1906.)**

**On the north, west and south walls of the same shrine.**

This registers a sale of land by Kambattadigal, son of Kandichchi Mapparradigal of Tirumarperu in Valla-nadu of Damr-kottam, to Madhrantakan Gandaradittan who endowed it for a lamp in the temple. Among the boundaries of the land is mentioned a channel called Vimaladitya-vaykkal. This may also be a record of Rajaraja I.

**No. 31.**

**(A.R. No. 294 of 1906.)**

**On the same walls.**

This is an incomplete record evidently of Rajaraja I. It seems to register a sale of land by the temple authorities of Tirumalperu to Solamadeviyar alias Panchavan Madeviyar, queen of Perumal Mummudi-Chola (Rajaraja I), who endowed it to the temple for two perpetual lamps. Among the boundaries of the land is mentioned a land endowed by Madhrantaka-Gandaradittan for the sacred bath of the deity.

**No. 32.**

**(A.R. No. 295 of 1906.)**

**On the same wall.**

This is identical with No. 285 of 1906 (No. 29 above).

**No. 33.**

**(A.R. No. 306 of 1906.)**

**On the south wall of the central shrine, ruined Vishnu temple in the same village.**

This is a record of Rajaraja I. It consists of two portions, a Sanskrit verse and a Tamil prose passage recording the same grant, viz., a gift of 30 Suvarnas (gold coins-kalanju ?) by Aditya for feeding a Brahmana in a matha at Govindapadi. In the Tamil portion his name and family are detailed as Madhurantakan Achchapidaran, the son of Virasola Ilangovelar for Kodumbalur in Konadu. The donor was evidently a later member of the dynasty of Kodumbalur chiefs who were connected by ties of marriage with the Chola kings, and some of whom played an important part in  
the military campaigns of Rajarajaâ€™s predecessors against Ceylon and the Pandyas (S. I. I. V, No. 980 and M. E. R. 1908, paras 84-91).

**No. 34.**

**(A.R. No. 312 of 1906.)**

**On the same wall.**

This inscription records both in Sanskrit and in Tamil the provision made for burning a lamp in the temple of Perumanadigal Kamasari, i.e., Krishna, in the Sanskrit portion) at Govindapadi by a Vellala resident of Kulakkudi in Pidavur-nadu, a subdivision of Irungolapadi. This is engraved almost as a continuation of, and in the same script as No. 311 of 1906 of the 34th year of Parantaka I.

**No. 35.**

**(A.R. No. 169 of 1907.)**

**Tiruppalatturai, Trichinopoly Taluk, Trichinopoly district.**

**On the south wall of the central shrine, Adimulesvara temple.**

This records an endowment of lands made after purchase by a certain Kuttappiran-Bhattan of Adanur for the requirements of worship and offerings in the temple, which are specified in detail. The alphabet of this record is similar to that of No. 170 of 1907 of Vikrama-Chola, and the style of wording is also comparatively late, and hence this may be ascribed to the reign of Kulottunga-Chola I.

**No. 36.**

**(A.R. No. 182 of 1907.)**

**Uraiyur, Trichinopoly Taluk, Trichinopoly District.**

**On the south wall of the central shrine, Panchavaranesvara temple.**

The inscription is damaged. It records a gift of land by a certain Kaviniyan Kirttima\[r\*\]ttanda-Brahmadharajan alias Se . . . . Kunjaramallan for an offering to the deity during the early morning service in the temple of Udaitalaipperumal of the village. Mention is made of two fields, one called Kunjaramalla-Vayakkal and the other Velkula-Bhima-Vayakkal. By Velkula-Bhima is perhaps meant the Eastern Chalukya Bhima II; more probably it might be a title of Parantaka I assumed after his overthrow of Sitpuli (-nadu ?) in Nellore which formed part of the Eastern Chalukya dominion (M. E. R. 1936-37, para 20). This should be a record of Gandaraditya.

**No. 37.**

**(A.R. No. 202 of 1907.)**

**Tiruvidaimarudur, Kumbhakonam Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On the north wall of the central shrine, Mahalingasvamin temple.**

This is an incomplete inscription recording probably some gift of land.

**No. 38.**

**(A.R. No. 242 of 1907.)**

**On the south wall of the same shrine.**

The inscription records an endowment of 6 Karunkasu (the same as Ilakkasu ?) entrusted with the Senaiyar (Military body) of the place, for the daily supply of two tender cocoanuts for offering after the midday worship, to god Mahadeva of the Mulasthana at Tiruvidaimarudil in Tiraimur-nadu on the southern bank (of the river), by Karuttan Sattan of Arisattanur in Kana-nadu, who calls himself an agent of the chief of Kilar-nadu (or â€˜of Nattukkonar, the kilar i.e., the elderâ€™ of the place ?)

**No. 39.**

**(A.R. No. 325 of 1907.)**

**Tiruvisalur, same Taluk and District.**

**On the north wall of thecentral shrine, Sivayoganathasvamin temple.**

The inscription is damaged. It registers a gift of land made tax-free after purchase, by Siddhavadavan Suttiyar, a queen of Uttama-Chola and daughter of a Miladu chief (name not given), to provide for 108 pots of water for the sacred bath on the day of sankranti every month, of the god (Paramasvami) at Tiruvisalur in Amaninarayana-chaturvedimangalam on the northern bank (of the Kaveri). This is evidently a record of Rajaraja I.

**No. 40.**

**(A.R. No. 327 of 1907.)**

**On the same wall.**

This is an unfinished inscription which refers to Pirantakan Madevadiga, the mother of Uttama-Chola, as making a similar endowment as in No. 39 above for the sacred bath of god Tiruvisalur-Paramasvami at Avaninarayana-chaturvedimangalam. This is also evidently a record of Rajaraja I.

**No. 41.**

**(A.R. No. 379 of 1909.)**

**Siddhalingamadam, Tirukkoyilur Taluk, South Arcot District.**

**On the north wall of the mandapa in front of the central shrine, Vyaghrapadesvara temple.**

This is engraved below No. 378 of 1909 of Vikrama-Chola and in similar characters. It is obviously a copy of an early inscription as the temple is known to have been renovated in the reign of Kulottunga I by one of his officers, when al the earlier inscriptions should have been reproduced on the new walls (M. E. R.1910, para 24). It records an endowment of sheep for lamp to the temple of Tiruppulippagavar by a chief, Siddavadan of Maladu.

**No. 42.**

**(A.R. No. 682 of 1909.)**

**Tirunedungulam, Trichinopoly Taluk, Trichinopoly District.**

**On the south wall of the Ganesa shrine, Nedungalanathasvamin temple.**

The inscription registers an endowment of land after reclamation, which was left in charge of the sthanikas of the temple, by a certain . . . . . . . . . . midayan Varadan alias Arumunikanda-Perunayar for offerings of rice twice a day to the image of Likasundara set up in the temple of the god at Tirunedungalam in Kaviranadu by Mosi Orriyuran Kuttan-Piran of Tiruvanakkaval, who was probably a relation (father ?) of the donor.

**No. 43.**

**(A. R. No. 262 of 1910.)**

**Tiruvadandai, Chingleput Taluk, Chingleput District.**

**On the south wall of the central shrine, Varaha-Perumal temple.**

This records an agreement given by the sabha of Madambakkam (s. a. Madambakkam in the Saidapet taluk) alias Anidira-mangalam in Nedungunra-nadu, a sub-division of Puliyur-kottam, to pay as interest every year on 15 kalanju of gold received by them from Nakkan Pirantakan alias Brahmasrirajan, a resident of Alaiyur in Poygai-nadu of Sonadu, ninety nali of oil calculated at one ulakku per day, for a perpetual lamp in the temple at Tiruvidavandai, a devadana in Paduvur-nadu a sub-division of Amur-kottam. In default the sabha made itself liable for a fine of 8 Â¼ kanam a day to be paid to the Dharmasana and for a levy of a manrupadu tax of a manjadi a day to the then reigning king. The sabha of Tiruvidavandai through its Tiruvunnaligai-variyap-perumakkal (temple-committee) held itself responsible for the collection of this oil and for burning the lamp.

Alaiyur in Poygai-nadu may be identified with Allur in the Tanjore taluk, since Tillaisthanam in the same taluk (No. 47 below) was also like Alaiyur in Poygai-nadu.

**No. 44.**

**(A. R. No. 227 of 1911.)**

**Kumbhakonam, Kumbhakonam Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On the north wall of thecentral shrine, Nagesvara temple.**

This records a sale of a quarter portion (or veli ?) of land (karchey) by the Mulaparishad of Tirukkudamukkil, a devadana in Pambur-nadu on the northern bank (of the Kaveri), to a certain Aravan Kalangamalai, a Vellala resident of Tanjavur who endowed it to the temple of Tirukkilkottattu-Paramasvamin for the daily feeding of a Sivayogi in the temple. The land is said to have formed part of 4 veli which the assembly had received a abhisheka-dakshinai (from the king).

**No. 45.**

**(A. R. No. 228 of 1911.)**

**On the same wall.**

This records a gift of 90 sheep for a perpetual lamp in the temple of Paramasvami of Kilkottam, by Kumaran Tudu\[va\]n, a Kaikkola resident of Tanjavur who was a member of the Virasola-terinja-Kaikkolar (community or regiment). They were left in charge of two shepherds who were to supply 7 nali and 1 uri of ghee every month for the purpose. Virasola was a surname of king Parantaka I and the inscription might therefore be referred to Gandaraditya, his immediate successor.

**No. 46.**

**(A. R. No. 225 of 1911.)**

**On the south wall of the same shrine.**

The inscription is damaged. It seems to register a sale of 10 veli of land, including a portion situated at Arisalur which had been granted to the Mulaparadaip-Perumakkal of Tirukkudamukkil (by the king) as abhisheka-dakshinai to the temple of Tirukkikottattu-\[Parama\]svami in return for 1500 kalanju. It refers to a fine of 3000 kalanju received by Madirai-konda-Udaiyar (Parantaka I) and to the Pandippadaiyar (regiment). Mention is also made of (a temple of) Jalasayana. This might be a record of Gandaraditya.

**No. 47.**

**(A. R. No. 278 of 1911.)**

**Tillasthanam, Tanjore Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On the south wall of the central shrine, Ghritasthanesvara temple.**

This is an unfinished inscription in which two persons are mentioned evidently as donors to the temple of Mahadeva at Tiruneyttanam, a devadana of Kilpilaru in Poygai-nadu. One of them, Kuttan Nikalankan, is said to have belonged to the regiment called Smarakesarit-terinja-Kaikkolar and the other, Villi Tada . . . . . to Vikramasingat-terinja-Kaikkolar. These regiments might have derived their names from possible titles of Parantaka I, and hence the record might be assigned to Gandaraditya.

**No. 48.**

**(A. R. No. 279 of 1911.)**

**On the same wall.**

This is another unfinished inscription mentioning a gift to the same temple on behalf of Mallan Araiyan of the Samarakesarit-trinja-Kaikkolar (community or regiment). This is also probably a record of Gandaraditya like the inscription above.

**No. 49.**

**(A. R. No. 392 of 1913.)**

**Erumbur, Chidambaram Taluk, South Arcot District.**

**On the north wall of the central shrine, Kadambavanesvara temple.**

This records an endowment of 7 ma of land to provide for the daily offering of rice to thedeity in the temple of Siru-Tirukkoyil-Perumanadigal at Urumur in Nalvayalur-kurram by Aritan Kannan Kannan of the village. The local sabha undertook to maintain this gift.

**No. 50.**

**(A. R. No. 123 of 1914.)**

**Tiruverumbur, Trichinopoly Taluk, Trichinopoly District.**

**On the south wall of the central shrine, Pipilikesvara temple.**

The middle portion of the inscription is built in. This registers a joint sale of some land by the Perunguri-sabha of Srikantha-chaturvedimangalam and the Urar of Erumbiyur between whom the boundary of the land is said to have been a matter of dispute, to a certain Viranarayanan Sembiyan Vedivelar of Sirudavur in Kiliyur-nadu. They agreed to pay the taxes irai, echchoru and vettivedinai due on the land for a lump sum of gold received by them in addition to the sale amount, and also agreed to give the necessary supply of water for irrigation of the land from the tank at Srikantha-chaturvedimangalam. The land was endowed to the temple by the purchaser for the maintenance of our persons singing the tiruppadiyam (before the god). The donor is known from No. 51 below to have built the Srivimana of this temple.
