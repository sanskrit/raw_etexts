SOUTH INDIAN INSCRIPTIONS

VOLUME XIII

**INSCRIPTIONS OF RAJAKESARIVARMAN**

**No. 151.**

**(A.R. No. 232 of 1923.)**

**Koyil-Tevarayanpettai (near Pandaravadai), Papanasam Taluk, Tanjore**

**District. On the north wall of the central shrine, Matsyapurisvara temple.**

This records an agreement given by the *perunguri-sabhai* (Big Assembly) of **Simhavishnu-Chaturvedimangalam**, a *brahmadeya* in Mudichchol\[la\*\]-nadu, in consideration of a lump sum of 200 *kalanju* of gold expressed in terms of 3000 *kalam* of paddy, received by them from the donor, to exempt from all taxes the village Kundamangalam endowed to the temple of Bhumisundara-Vinnagar-Paramasvami, by **Kannandai Arivanan Bhumisundaran** *alias* **Sundarasola-Muvendavelan** of Valaippandal in Valaippandal-nadu in Palkunrak-kottam, a subdivision of Tondai-nadu, who is also said to have built the temple. The donorâ€™s surname suggests that the record may be one of **Sundara-Chola.**

**No. 152.**

**(A.R. No. 49 of 1923.)**

**Pullalur, Conjeeveram Taluk, Chingleput District.**

**On stones built (irregularly) into the walls of the Kamakshi-Amma shrine, Kailasanatha temple.**

This records the decision of the assembly of Paramesvara-chaturvedimangalam in Eyir-kottam I consultation with the Piran-adhi\[kari\] (officer), to enforce the obligation of the unangarpidi land (?) on the Sivabrahmanas of the temple of Sri Tandaladeva as the latter failed to burn the (stipulated) perpetual lamp (with the income there from), and to supervise the maintenance of the lamp in the temple themselves in future, through the perumakkal doing the variyam for the year and the uralvan.

**No. 153.**

**(A.R. No. 364 of 1924.)**

**Melappaluvur, Udaiyarpalaiyam Taluk, Trichinopoly District.**

**On the north wall of the Agastyesvara shrine, Agastyesvara temple.**

This records the gift of a lamp-stand and an endowment of 12 kalanju of gold for burning a perpetual lamp in the shrine of Mahadeva on the southern side of the temple of Avanikandarppa (gandharva) Isvaragriham, by Nakkan Akkaranangaiyar the daughter of Devanar â€˜of this Taliâ€™ and wife of prince (Pillai) Seramanar. In No. 385 of 1924 from the same place, dated in the 27th year of Rajaraja I, his queen Panchavan mahadevi is referred to as the daughter of Devanar of Avanikandarppapuram. The identity of â€˜Pillai Seramanarâ€™ is not known. He was possibly a feudatory of chief holding an important position under the Chola king. Friendly relationship is known to have prevailed between the Cheras and the Cholas since the time of Aditya I (S.I.I. Vol. III, No. 89).

**No. 154.**

**(A.R. No. 383 of 1924.)**

**On the south wall of the Cholesvara shrine, same temple.**

Another gift of 12 kalanju of gold for burning a perpetual lamp in the shrine of Mahadeva on the northern gate of same temple and a lamp-stand by Nakkan Akkara-Nangaiyar (See No. 153 above).

**No. 155.**

**(A.R. No. 362 of 1925.)**

**Palankoyil, Polur Taluk, North Arcot District.**

**On a pillar in front of the Mukha-mandapa, Phalagrahisvara temple.**

The inscription is badly damaged. The portion to the right of this which is the same script records a gift of gold for a perpetual lamp in the temple of Mahadeva at Palangolur by Chamunde . . . . . . . . . son of Papaiyan, an officer under Nulambar Virasola. Both this Papaiyan and Virasola figure in No. 361 of 1925 from the same place, dated in the 29th year of an unspecified king. The latter was possibly a local chieftain who was subordinate to Rajaraja I and was also known as Vira-Chola.

**No. 156.**

**(A.R. No. 187 of 1926.)**

**Tiruchchirrambalam, Pattukottai Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On a pillar in the Ardha-Mandapa, Puratanavanesvara temple.**

This records an endowment of land made by Pudi Uttaman of Velvur for offerings in the temple of Mahadeva at Tiruchchirremam, a devadana â€“ brahmadeya village in Rajaraja-nadu. It was made tax-free by the urar of Kulakkudi in Punrir-kurram for a lump-sum of 12 Â½ kalanju received by them from the donor. The name of the nadu suggests a late date for the inscription. Sirremam of Jnanasambandar is evidently this village and not Sittamur in the Tirutturaipundi taluk as taken by some hitherto (M.E.R. 1926, II. 9).
