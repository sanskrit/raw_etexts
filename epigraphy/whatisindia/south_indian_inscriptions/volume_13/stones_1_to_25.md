SOUTH INDIAN INSCRIPTIONS

VOLUME XIII

**INSCRIPTIONS OF RAJAKESARIVARMAN**

**No. 1.**

**(A. R. No. 570 of 1904.)**

**Tiruvarur, Negapatam Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On the south wall of the Achalesvara shrine, Tyagarajasvamin temple.**

This records a gift of two silver vessels in which offerings were to be made to god Tiruvaraneri-Alvar by Udaiyapirattiyar Sembian-Mahadeviyar for the merit of Uttama-Choladeva. This is evidently an inscription of the reign of Rajaraja I whose uncle was Uttama-Chola.

**No. 2.**

**(A. R. No. 586 of 1904.)**

**Srinivasanallur, Musiri Taluk, Trichnopoly District.**

**On the east wall of the Korangunathan temple.**

This records a gift of 30 sheep and 30 goats to provide ghee for a perpetual lamp in the temple of Tirukurakkuturai-Perumanadigal at Mahendramangalam, by Kappiyan Euvan Gangadharan of the village for the merit of Gangadharan Arattan. Judging from the writing the inscription may be ascribed to the reign of Gandaraditya.

**No. 3.**

**(A. R. No. 596 of 1904.)**

**On the north wall of the same temple.**

This inscription gives a list of the several tax-free temple lands with their incomes specifically allocated for the various requirements (of the temple) at the instance of Araiyar Acharakanta-Brahmadhiraja to the Mulaparishad of Mahendramangalam, who had this re-engraved on stone after collecting the necessary information, by appointing a committee (varigam) for that purpose. Incidentally we learn that provision was made for the playing of music during the sribali service by seven persons, three for mattali, one for maradigai, one for talam, one for padagam and one for sengandigai. The characters of the record and its style seem to point to the time of Rajaraja I.

**No. 4.**

**(A.R. No. 514 of 1905.)**

**Tiruvellarai, Trichinopoly Taluk, Trichinopoly District.**

**On the west wall of the central shrine in the Jambunatha temple.**

This inscription records an agreement given by the Mulaparishad of Tiruvellarai to burn a perpetual lamp in the temple of Tiruvanaikkallil-Bhattarakar with the interest on 25 kalanju of gold endowed by Marudan Achchan of Sankarappadi, (a hamlet of) Tiruvellarai.

**No. 5.**

**(A.R. No. 532 of 1905.)**

**On a pillar in the rock-cut cave, Pundarikaksha Perumal temple in the same village.**

This inscription is fragmentary and damaged. It stops with the mention of the big (temple ?) at Tiruvellarai.

**No. 6.**

**(A.R. No. 184 of 1907.)**

**Uraiyur, Trichinopoly Taluk, Trichinopoly District.**

**On the south wall of the central shrine, Panchavarnesvara temple.**

This inscription is built in at the end of each line. It records a gift of land by Kavuniyan Neri . . . . . . . . . . . . of Uraiyur, a brahmadeya village in Uraiyurkurram, to provide for the daily supply of ghee at one ulakku for a perpetual lamp in the temple.

**No. 7.**

**(A.R. No. 239 of 1907.)**

**Tiruvidaimarudur, Kumbhakonam Taluk, Tanjore District.**

This records an endowment of 8 ilukkasu by a certain kuralai Duggaiya-Kramavittan of Emanallur, a brahmadeya village in Manni-nadu on the northern bank (of the Kaveri), who was an agent of a chief (?) of Kila-nadu, for the daily supply of ten plantain fruits for offering to the image of Purana-Ganapati set up on the south side of the Mulasthana at Tiruvidaimardil in Tiraimur-nadu on the southern bank. The money was entrusted to the Senaiyar (Military Community ?) of the place. The currency of Ceylon coinage here may by noted.

**No. 8.**

**(A.R. No. 314 of 1907.)**

**Tiruvisalur, Kumbhakonam Taluk Tanjore District.**

**On the north wall of the central shrine, Sivayoganathasvamin temple.**

of Parantaka I as also that of the Pallava king Nandivarman III.

**No. 9.**

**(A.R. No. 317 of 1907.)**

**On the same wall.**

This inscription registers an endowment of land after purchase for feeding a Veda-Brahmana every midday in the temple at Tiruvisalur by Pirantakan Irungolan alias Siriyavelar of Kodumbalur, who was a general of king Parantaka II Sundara-Chola.

**No. 10.**

**(A.R. No. 156 of 1908.)**

**No. 11.**

**(A.R. No. 321 of 1910.)**

**Tirumeyjanam, Kumbhakonam Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On the north wall of thecentral shrine, Jnanaparamesvara temple.**

The early characters of the inscription make it attributable to the time of Aditya I.

**No. 12.**

**(A.R. No. 329-A of 1910.)**

**On the same wall.**

This inscription is damaged. It seems to record an endowment of an areca garden to the temple of Sambaresvara at Nalur in Serrur-kurram. This seems to be a record of Rajaraja I because of the close resemblance of its writing to that of a fragment of Rajendra Chola I immediately below.

**No. 13.**

**(A.R. No. 222 of 1904.)**

**Tirunagesvaram, Kumbhakonam Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On a pillar lying in a mandapa at the end of the street in front of the Naganathasvamin temple.**

This inscription is engraved in archaic characters and has been assigned therefore to Aditya I. It records the provision made by the Perunagarattar (merchant community) of Kumaramattandapuram in Tiraimur-nadu for the renovation of the surrounding hall (tiruchchurralai) and the gopura in a (Jaina) temple called the Miladudaiyar-palli. Kumaramarttanda seems to have been a surname of the Pallava king Nandivarman III (No. 199 of 1907).

Published in South Indian Inscriptions, Vol. III, No. 91.

**No. 14.**

**(A.R. No. 21 of 1914.)**

**Tirumananjeri, Mayavaram Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On the south wall of thecentral shrine, Udvahanathasvamin temple.**

This records an order of Sembiyan-Mahadeviyar, the mother of Uttama-Chola fixing the allotment of paddy for the several items of daily expense in the temple of Tirukkarrali-Mahadeva at Tirumananjeri, near Kadalangudi in Kurukkai-nadu, out of the produce from 14 veli of land endowed by her in Mulangudi in Nallarrur-nadu. This is evidently an inscription of the time of Rajaraja I.

**No. 15.**

**(A.R. No. 466 of 1918.)**

**Tiruvenkadu, Shiyali Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On a pillar near the north wall of the central shrine, Svetaranyesvara temple.**

This is a damaged inscription recording a gift of 96 sheep (for a lamp). Mention is made of Perunarkilli-Chola (See No. 21 below).

**No. 16.**

**(A.R. No. 491 of 1918.)**

**On the east inner gopura, left side, of the same temple.**

This records an endowment of 60 kalanju of gold by a certain Ayyan Vembadigal of the Parttivasekarat-terinja-Kaikkolar (regiment ?) for daily offerings and for feeding in the temple of Tiruvengadudevar. The assembly of Nangur received the amount and sold to the temple tax-free, one veli of land for this purpose. Among the boundaries of the land mentioned, are a high road leading to Pattanam (Kaverippumpattinam), and another land which had been endowed to the temple by a certain Kottappichcholar (Pottapi-Chola). This person may be identical with the chief Pottappichcholar Sattiyaraiyar figuring in a record from Vriddhachalam in the South Arcot district (No. 49 of 1918), dated in the 7th year of Rajaraja I, and hence the present inscription may be assigned to that king. Parthivasekhara after whom the Kaikkolar regiment was called seems to have been a title of Rajaraja.

**No. 17.**

**(A.R. No. 607 of 1920.)**

**Udayargudi (near Kattumannarkoyil), Chidambaram Taluk, Sourth Arct District.**

**On the north wall of the central shrine, Anantesvara temple.**

A gift of 12 Â½ kalanju of gold for a perpetual lamp in the temple of Tiruvanantisvarattu-Paramasvami at Viranarayana-chaturvedimangalam by Kanjai Tiruvenkada-Kramavittan of Kondandaramachcheri. Viranarayana was a surname of Parantaka I. This record might be referred to the reign of either Gandaraditya or Sundara-Chola.

**No. 18.[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_13/stones_1_to_25.html#_ftn1)**

**(A.R. No. 124 of 1925.)**

**Tiruvaduturai, Mayavaram Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On the south wall of the central shrine, Gomuktisvara temple.**

This is an incomplete inscription, recording a gift of 12 kalanju of gold for a perpetual lamp in the temple of Tiruvavaduturai-Mahadeva at Sattanur, a brahmadeya in Tiraimur-nadu by a merchant of Karuppur. The wiring appears to be earlier than that of No. 17 above.

**No. 19.**

**(A.R. No. 267 of 1925.)**

**Tiruvidaikkali, Mayavaram Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On the north wall of the mandapa in frong of the central shrine, Subrahmanya temple.**

This inscription is damaged. It seems to register the mortgage of a piece of land for the dues of 200 kalam of paddy by Korrappalli Kandan Ayyan, a resident scholar (?) of the village, to the temple at Tiruvidaikkali, a devadana in Kurumbur-nadu. The characters appear to be similar to those of No. 17 above.

**No. 20.**

**(A.R. No. 70 of 1928.)**

**Tiruppugalur, Nannilam Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On the south wall of thecntral shrine, Agnipurisvara temple.**

This is a fragmentary epigraph registering a gift of a silver vessel to (god) Sri Pugalurdeva. Below and close to this is another fragment of the 3rd year of a king whose name is lost, which records gift of a silver pot to the same deity by Pa\[Bha)ttan Danatungi\[yar\], a queen of Uttama-Chola.

**No. 21.**

**(A.R. No. 143 of 1928.)**

**Tiruppalanam, Tanjore Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On the north wall of the central shrine, Apatsahayesvara temple.**

This records a gift of 30 kalanju of gold for a perpetual lamp in the temple of Mahadeva at Tiruppalanam, a devadana in Mirai-kurram, by Solaperumanadigal Perunerkillich-Chola. The donor is evidently identical with king Rajakesarivarman himself who was called so after his great ancestor Perunarkilli of Sangam fame who performed the Rajasuya sacrifice. The same surname is found for the donor in No. 15 above from Tiruvenkada, which is also dated in the 2nd year of Rajakesarivarman.

**No. 22.**

**(A.R. No. 191 of 1931.)**

**Tiruchchatturai, Tanjore Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On the south wall of the central shrine, Odanavanesvara temple.**

This records an endowment of 145 kalanju of gold by Somasi Sendan alias Solaperunkavidi, the Madhyastha of Ayirattali, for daily offerings in the temple of Tiruchchorrutturai-Mahadeva. The Patipadamula-Pattudai-devakanmis of the temple undertook to maintain this gift with the (interest in) paddy derived from the temple land at Kodyalam.

**No. 23.**

**(A.R. No. 349 of 1904.)**

**Kudumiyamalai, Pudukkottai State.**

**On the south wall of the rock-cut shrine, Melaikoyil temple.**

This records a gift of 31 cows for the supply of milk for the early morning bath of the deity, and milk and ghee for offerings in the temple of Tirunilakkunrattu-Paramesvara by Sandaiyan, a cavalier of Mahimalaiya-Irukkuvelar. This Irukkuvelar is also called Parantakan Virasolan in No. 117 (published below) dated in the 5th year of the king. This may be a record either of Gandaraditya or Parantaka II Sundara-Chola.

**No. 24.**

**(A.R. No. 466 of 1904.)**

**Vedaranyam, Tirutturaippundi Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On a pillar in the mandapa in front of the Tyagaraja shrine in the Vedaranyesvara temple.**

This is slightly damaged. It seems to record a gift of 90 sheep for a perpetual lamp in the temple of Mahadeva at Tirumaraikkadu, a devadana in Umbala-nadu, by a lady, Nangai \[Pa\]ravvaiyar, a â€˜parikaiâ€™ in the Big Temple (or palace at Tiruvarur and another individual, probably an officer of the king (Tiru-ulagaperumanar).

**No. 25.**

**(A.R. No. 469-A of 1904.)**

**On another pillar in the same mandapa.**

This records a similar gift of 90 sheep left in charge of the servants of the temple at Tirumaraikkadu, a devadana in Umbala-nadu, for burning a perpetual lamp in the temple with an ulakku of ghee daily, by a native of Velur in Oyma-nadu.
