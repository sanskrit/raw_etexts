SOUTH INDIAN INSCRIPTIONS

VOLUME XIII

**INSCRIPTIONS OF RAJAKESARIVARMAN**

**No. 126.**

**(A.R. No. 139 of 1931.)**

**Tiruchchatturai, Tanjore Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On the north wall of the central shrine, Odanavanesvara temple.**

This records an endowment of l30 *kalanju* of gold by **Velan Tiruvenkadadigal** *alias* **Muvenda-Pidavur-Velan** of Pidavur in Pidavur-nadu for burning a perpetual lamp in the temple of Tiruchchorrutturai-Mahadeva. The *urkilar-makkal* of Kodiyalam, the *brahmadeya-Kuavargal* and the *urar* of the village, held themselves responsible for the maintenance of the lamp. Evidently the same gift is recorded in No. 137 of 1931 also in Sanskrit, the next of which is given below. To judge from its writing and disposition with regard to No. 138 of 1931 of the 13^(th) year of Parantaka I, this is possible a record of **Gandaraditya.**

**No. 127.**

**(A.R. No. 219 of 1931.)**

**Manamadi, Chingleput Taluk, Chingleput District.**

**On the wall of the central shrine, Tirukkarisvara temple.**

This inscription is built in at the beginning of the lines. It records an endowment of a land for burning a perpetual lamp in the temple of Tirukkara-puradeva at Kalakkattur (Manamadi) by a resident of the village.

**No. 128.**

**(A.R. No. 442 of 1904.)**

**Vedaranyam, Tirutturaipundi Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On a pillar in the mandapa in front of the central shrine, Vedaranyesvara temple.**

This inscription is damaged. It seems to record an allocation of paddy from certain fields, to provide for offerings daily during the midday service in the temple of Bhuvanavitankadeva at Tirumaraikkadu, and for (special) offerings to the deity on the festival days in the months of Aippigai and Masi. Mention is made of Tirumaraikkadan Sokkan alias Soliyanga . . . . . . . . . . probably a donor.

**No. 129.**

**(A.R. No. 381 of 1905.)**

**Kaveripakkam, Arkonam Taluk, North Arcot District.**

**On the north wall of the central shrine, Sundaravarada-Perumal temple.**

This inscription is left unfinished, and stops with the mention of Paduvurkottam.

**No. 130.**

**(A.R. No. 382 of 1905.)**

**On the west and south walls of the same shrine.**

This inscription registers a gift of 90 sheep for burning a lamp in the temple of Kirttima\[r\*\]ttanda-Kalap\[ri\*\]yadeva by Sambakkan, son of Pandipparan Kumarasetti, a merchant of Kirttima\[r\*\]ttanda-ttanda-Kalap\[ri\]yam village in Sirutimiri-nadu, a district in Paduvur-kottam. The late Mr. V. Venkayya surmised that the temple might have owed its origin to the Rashtrakuta king Krishna III in whose Karhad inscription (Epigraphia Indica, Vol. IV, p. 281), the king is stated to have encamped at Melpadi for constructing temples to Kalapriya, Gandamarttanda, Krishnesvara and others (M.E.R. 1906, II. 21). The Rajakesarivarman of this inscription was very probably Sundara-Chola.

**No. 131.**

**(A.R. No. 220 of 1906.)**

**Perangiyur, Tirukkoyilur Taluk, South Arcot District.**

**On the north and west walls of the central shrine, ruined Siva temple.**

This inscription registers an endowment of two plots of land made by the assembly (perunguri-perumakkal) of Peringur, one for burning a perpetual lamp in the temple of Mulasthanattu-Perumanadigal, and the other for the daily feeding of a tapasvin in the temple, made for the merit of a servant f the temple named Ganavadi Nambi Aruran who is said to have sacrificed his life for the service of the deity. The exact nature of the sacrifice and the necessity for it are not given in the inscription. The former land is stated to have been left in charge of the Rudraganap-perumakkal for being reclaimed. This may belong to Rajaraja I to whose inscription (No. 219 of 1906) on the same wall it bears a close resemblance in writing.

**No. 132.**

**(A.R. No. 268 of 1906.)**

**Tirumalpuram, Arkonam Taluk, North Arcot District.**

**On the south wall of the central shrine, Manikanthesvara temple.**

This records a gift of 20 cows for the supply of milk for the early morning service of the deity in the temple of Tirumalperu-Udaiyar, by Madirantakan Gandaradi\[t\*\]tan. This is evidently a record of Rajaraja I in whose records this donor largely figures.
