SOUTH INDIAN INSCRIPTIONS

VOLUME XIII

**INSCRIPTIONS OF RAJAKESARIVARMAN**

**No. 251.**

(A.R. No. 203 of 1926.)

Sendalai, Tanjore Taluk, Tanjore District.

On the west wall of the central shrine, Sundaresvara temple.

This records an endowment of 6 *ma* of land for burning a perpetual lamp in the temple of Tirupperundurai-Paramesvara at Chandralekai-chaturvedimangalam, a *brahmadeya* in Arkkattu-kurram, and to provide for the principal offerings on the 6^(th) day of a festival to the god in the month of Chittirai, by **Kalavana Narayana-Narayanan** of Tirumangalam a resident of the village. This field is said to have formed part of a plot of 9 *ma* of land belonging to the donor who had presented the remaining 3 *ma* to his (younger) wife **Srirama Nilakanti** on the occasion of his marriage with her. This is very probably an inscription of **Sundara-Chola.**

**No. 252.**

**(A.R. No. 188 of 1931.)**

**Tiruchchatturai, Tanjore Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On the south wall of the central shrine, Odanavanesvara temple.**

This inscription is incised in early script with the virama marked over final consonants in a few cases, and is probably a record of Aditya I.
The ends of lines are built in. It records a gift of sheep for a lamp in the temple of Tiruchchorrutturai-Mahadeva by a native of Arkattu-kurram.

**No. 253.**

**(A.R. No. 300 of 1908.)**

**Tirukkalittattai, Kumbakonam Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On the south wall of the central shrine, Vedapurisvara temple.**

This records an endowment of 25 Ilakkasu for burning a perpetual lamp in the temple of Tirukkuduttittai-Perumal at Amaninarayana-chaturvedimangalam, a devadana-brahmadeya on the northern bank (of the Kaveri), by Vimaladevarasa Vasudevabhatta-Somayaji of Aranaippuram, and evidently of an equal amount for a second lamp by a resident of Panaiyur named Chandrasekharan Tirumoy-Adiâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦ The inscription is probably one of Sundara-Chola.

**No. 254.**

**(A.R. No. 330 of 1910.)**

**Tirumeyjnanam, Kumbakonam Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On the north wall of the central shrine, Jnanaparamesvara temple.**

This records an agreement given by the servants of the temple of Tirumayanattu-Paramesvara at Nalur to burn 12 lamps every evening for three hours in the temple with (the interest on) 12 Ilakkasu received by them from Naranan Soladigal alias Tirunavukkaraiyan, a merchant of the place, subject to a fine in case of default.

This records the endowment of a perpetual lamp in the temple of Tirukkilkottattu-Perumanadigal at Tirukkudamukkil by a certain Kalayan Manikkam, who also presented 2 tadam (?) and one kadaram (drum). The writing looks early, and might be assigned to the period of Aditya I.

**Udayargudi (near Kattumannarkoyil), Chidambaram taluk, South Arcot District.**

**in front of the central shrine, Anantisvara temple.**

This is an incomplete inscription, meant to record a gift by a private individual to the temple of Tiruvanantisvarattu-Paramasvami at Viranarayana-chaturvedimangalam. This is probably assignable to Sundara-Chola.

**No. 257.**

**(A.R. No. 548 of 1921.)**

**Pullamngai (near Pasupatikoyil), Papanasam Taluk, Tanjore District.**

This records a gift of 90 sheep by a certain Virasikhamani-Pa\[lla\]va\[rai\]yar for burning a perpetual lamp in the temple of Tiruvalandurai-  
Mahadeva, with an ulakku of ghee to be supplied every day. Probably an inscription of Sundara-Chola.
