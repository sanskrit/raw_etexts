VOLUME XIII

**INSCRIPTIONS OF RAJAKESARIVARMAN**

**No. 301.**

**(A.R. No. 18 of 1920.)**

**Tirumalavadi, Udaiyarpalaiyam Taluk, Trichnopoly District.**

**On the west wall of the central shrine, Vaidyanatha temple.**

This records a sale of land tax-free, for three *kalanju* by **Svandi Sendan Kallai,** the headman of Vattanarkudi a *brahmadeya* in Poygai-nadu, to **Ayiravan Enadi** the headman of Arkkadu in Arkkattu-kurram and the endowment of the same by the latter as *devadana* to the temple of Mahadeva at Tirumalavadi. An inscription evidently of **Aditya I.**

**No. 302**

**(A.R. No. 442 of 1922.)**

**Kayar, Chingleput Taluk, Chingleput District.**

**On a pillar in the Aderisvara temple.**

This is probably an inscription of Aditya I. It records the sale of some lands tax-free, by the sabha of Kayaru in Kumili-nadu a subdivision of Amur-kottam, to a certain Tali-Senan of Vandalanjeri in Naraiyur-nadu a subdivision of Sola-nadu, who endowed them to the temple of Aderip-Pidarar for offerings and lamp to the god Kuttap-Perumanadigal (Nataraja) in the temple.

**Puduppakkam, Conjeeveram taluk, Chingleput District.**

**On two broken slabs lying in the compound of the Selliyamman temple.**

This records the remission of taxes granted by the sabha of the village on two pieces of land endowed to the temple of . . . . . . . .ni-Bhatari at Nallilamangalam in Merpalugu\[r-nadu\] a subdivision of Manaiyir-kottam, one by a member of the alunganamand the other by the ilamakkal after purchasing them from the Karttigaiganattar. Probably a record of Aditya I.

**No. 304**

**(A.R. No. 161 of 1928.)**

**Tiruppalanam, Tanjore Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On the south wall of the central shrine, Apatsahayesvara temple.**

This is an inscription of Aditya I. It is damaged in places and the portion at the end is peeled off. It records a gift of 20 kalanju of gold for a perpetual lamp in the temple at Tiruppalanam in Virai-kurram, by Kadupattigal Tamarmettiyar the mother of Vayiri-Ak\[kan\] alias Tribhuvanamadeviyar the queen of Solaperumanadigal (Chola king). The name of the donatrix indicates that she was of the Pallava family with whom the king should have contracted marriage relationship.

**No. 305**

**(A.R. No. 164 of 1931.)**

**Tiruchchatturai, Tanjore Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On the west and south walls of the central shrine, Odanavanesvara temple.**

This inscription is engraved in early characters with the virama marked for final consonants, and may therefore be assigned to Aditya I. It is built in at the right end. It records an endowment of 25 kalanju of gold for burning a lamp with 5 pidi of ghee to be supplied daily from the interest thereon, by . . . . . . . .yan-Nagan.

**No. 306**

**(A.R. No. 592 of 1904.)**

**Srinivasanallur, Musiri Taluk, Trichinopoly District.**

**On the south wall of the Korangunathan temple.**

This registers a gift of 1 Â½ ma of garden-land free of taxes, for burning a perpetual lamp in the temple of Tirukkurakkutturai-Perumanadigal at the brahmadeya village Mayendiramangalam, by Kachchuvan (Kasyapa) Jataveda Nila\[n\] of Tottyam, after duly â€˜notifying his intentionâ€™ to the sabhai-varigar and the Ariga(ya)-bhatarar. The alphabet of the inscription is early and hence the record may be referred to the time of Aditya I.

**No. 307**

**(A.R. No. 401 of 1905.)**

**Kaverippakkam, Arkonam Taluk, North Arcot District.**

**On a pillar in the mandapa in front of the Varadaraja-Perumal temple.**

This inscription is much damaged. It seems to record a gift of 15 kalanju of gold made for burning a perpetual lamp in the temple at Kavdippakkam Avaninarayana-chaturvedimangalam situated in Paduvur-kottam. The mahasabha of the village which included members of the several committees such as urvariyam, udasinavariyam, ponvariyam, kalanivariyam and Srikoyilvariyam as well as the bhattas and the visishtas seem to have been in charge of the endowment.

**No. 308**

**(A.R. No. 86 of 1908.)**

**Nerkunam, Wandiwash Taluk, North Arcot District.**

**On a slab set up in front of the Silaiyamman temple.**

This inscription registers a grant of land as erippatti for the upkeep of a tank at Nerukunram in Singapura-nadu by a certain Nambiyamallanar, son of Nripatunga Mangalapperaraiyar. The early script of the inscription makes it assignable to Aditya I.

**No. 309**

**(A.R. No. 308 of 1910.)**

**Nalur, Papanasam Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On the door-posts at the entrance into the Palasapurisvara temple.**

The characters of the inscription are early. It slightly damaged, and it seems to register an agreement of the mahasabha of Nalur a brahmadeya in Serrurkurram undertaking to receive no other tax than tattirai on the produce of an areca-garden in Vadasattangudi alias Kalaranjenda-chaturvedimangalam, which had been leased by the shareholders of the village. The sabha is said to have met for this deliberation in the hall (?) called Vennakkanar-ambalam.

**No. 310**

**(A.R. No. 208 of 1926.)**

**Sendalai, Tanjore Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On the south wall of the central shrine, Sundaresvara temple.**

This records a gift of 5 kalanju of gold for burning a lamp during the day in the temple of Tirupperundurai-Perumanadigal at Chandiralekai-chaturvedimangalam a brahmadeya in Arkattuk-kurram, by a lady named Narayanan Pundi, the wife of Arigan Duvedi Narayanan Sadaiyan of Pulikalam in Eriyur-nadu. The early alphabet of the inscription and the high regnal year of the king make it assignable to Aditya I.

\>

**No. 311**

**(A.R. No. 210 of 1926.)**

**On the same wall.**

This is also evidently an inscription of Aditya I like No. 310 above. It records a gift of 1\[5\] kalanju of gold by Bataran Valiyan for burning a perpetual lamp in the temple of Tirupperundurai-Mahade\[va\] with the daily supply of an ulakku of ghee received towards the interest thereon.

**No. 312**

**(A.R. No. 400 of 1905.)**

**Kaveripakkam, Arkonam Taluk, North Arcot District.**

**On a pillar in the mandapa in front of the varadaraja-Perumal temple.**

This is probably an inscription of **Rajaraja I.** It records some regulations banning the service of women (for conducting the festivals in the temple) as decided by the *mahasabha* of Kavidipakkam *alias* Avaninarayana-chaturvedimangalam in Paduvur-kottam, on an order received by the them from the king through **Venbaikudinattu-Velar. â€˜Avaninarayanaâ€™** is known to have been a *biruda* of Pallava Nandivarman III. We learn that the assembly comprised the committees *urvariyam, udasinavariyam, erivariyam* and the *kalanivariyam* and of the *bhattas* and *visishtas* of the village.

**No. 313**

**(A.R. No. 522 of 1905.)**

**Tiruvellarai, Trichinopoly Taluk, Trichinopoly District.**

**On the rock in front of the Siva temple.**

This registers a gift of 30 cows for the maintenance of a perpetual lamp in the temple of sriyanaikkal-Perumanadigal at Tiruvellarai by Sembiyan Malanattu-Velan alias Korran Maran of \[Kai\]kalur. The gift was left in charge of the mulaparishat. The high regnal year of the king and the early script of the inscription make it attributable to Aditya I.

**No. 314**

**(A.R. No. 705 of 1909.)**

**Alambakkam, Lalgudi Taluk, Trichinopoly District.**

**On the north wall of the central shrine, Selliyamman temple.**

The inscription is slightly damaged. Like the above this is also assignable to Aditya I. It records that a quarter veli of wet land which had been endowed by the sabha of Dantivarma-mangalam previously for the repairs of the srivimana of the Saptamatri temple, was now assigned by them for a flower-garden to the (same ?) temple. The name Dantivarma-mangalam found for Alambakkam in the inscription suggests that the village should have been founded by the Pallava king Dantivarman, who is known to have held sway in these regions and is also surmised to have built the Kailasantha temple at this place (M.E.R. for 1910, II, 7.)

**No. 315**

**(A.R. No. 170 of 1928.)**

**Tiruppalanam, Tanjore Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On the south wall of the central shrine, Apatsahayesvara temple.**

This records a gift of 30 kalanju of gold left with the â€˜Thirty-twoâ€™ (members of the assembly), for burning a perpetual lamp in the temple of Mahadeva at Tiruppalanam a devadana in Virai-kurram, by Sembiyan Arkattu-Velan alias Maravan Nakkan the headman of Purisai in Parivandatturai a subdivision of Arkattu-kurram. Evidently an inscription of Aditya I.

**No. 316.**

**(A.R. No. 186 of 1931.)**

**Tiruchchatturai, Tanjore Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On the south wall of the central shrine, Odanavanesvara temple.**

This inscription is much damaged and the ends of lines are built in. It seems to register an endowment of gold (to the temple).

**No. 317.**

**(A.R. No. 168 of 1904.)**

**Tiruvakkarai, Villupuram Taluk, South Arcot District.**

**At the southern entrance into the central shrine, right side, Chandramaulisvara temple.**

This inscription records a gift of 100 kadi of paddy by a lady named Pugalttunai-Adigal mother of one Vilupperaraiyar Ayyakutti-Adigal, which was left in charge of the body called kulankilarkal of Tiruvakkarai. With the annual interest of 25 kadi accruing on this endowment, its members were to provide for the sacred bath of the deity Tirukkarkarrali-Perumanadigal on the days of the asterism Chitra in Chittirai month and of Sravana (Onam) in Purattadi every year. The high regnal year of the king with however no qualifying epithet for him would make the inscription assignable to Aditya I, but the characters seem to be later.

\>

**No. 318.**

**(A.R. No. 487 of 1904.)**

**Vedaranyam, Tirutturaippundi Taluk, Tanjore District**

**On a pillar in the mandapa in front of Ramanathesvara shrine, Vedaranyesvara temple.**

This is engraved on the same pillar as No. 205 above of the kingâ€™s 10th year. It states that the devaridaichchanrar (temple servants) agreed to measure an uri of ghee every day for burning 2 lamps in the temple, for 180 sheep presented by two persons Satta Sanran and Satta Damodiran both natives of Amanappulam in Malainadu. The Alphabet is early and the record may be of the time of Aditya I.

**No. 319.**

**(A.R. No. 177 of 1928.)**

**Tiruppalanam, Tanjore Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On the south wall of the mandapa to the south of the central shrine, Apatsahayesvara temple.**

This should also be an inscription of Aditya I. It records the gift of a gold necklace of rudraksha beads with a clasp (?) set with diamonds, rubies and sapphire for the god by Gangama\[r\*\]ttanda alias Sembiyn Prithivigangaraiyar, son of Mahadevar (the chief) of Pangala-nadu. This donor has been surmised to be the brother of Alivin Kallarasi alias Sembiyan Bhuvanigangaraiyar of Nos. 93 and 177 of 1931 and Sembiyan Prithivigangaraiyar of No. 139 of 1928 (M.E.R. 1931, II, 8).

**No. 320.**

**(A.R. No. 94 of 1931.)**

**Tiruppundurutti, Tanjore Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On the south wall of the central shrine, Pushpavanesvara temple.**

The writing of this inscription is early and the record may be assigned to Aditya I. It registers the gift of a lamp-stand and an endowment of 25 kalanju of gold for burning a perpetual lamp in the temple of Mahadeva at Tirutturutti, by Kavidi Subrahmanyan of Suduvur in Peruvaliyur-nadu a subdivision of Pandi-nadu.

**No. 321.**

**(A.R. No. 218 of 1904.)**

**Mel-Sevur, Gingee Taluk, South Arcot District.**

**On the south base of the mandapa in front of the central shrine, Vrishabhapurisvara temple.**

This is a record of Aditya I, mutilated at the right end. It seems to register the gift of a golden fore head plate (evidently to an image in the temple) by a lady, the wife of (prince) Kannaradeva. The gift was left in charge of the nagarattar of Manavur. Kannaradeva is surmised to have been a son of Aditya and brother to Parantaka (M.E.R. 1895, p. 5)

**No. 322.**

**(A.R. No. 230 of 1928.)**

**Brahmadesam, Cheyyar Taluk, North Arcot District**

**On the south wall of the central shrine, Chandramaulisvara temple.**

The inscription is damaged. It seems to record a gift of 10 kalanju of gold for a perpetual lamp in the temple of Tiruppondaip-Perumanadigal at Rajamalla-chaturvedimangalam by Ashtamurtti, a resident of the village, and an endowment in land by his wife (name lost), after purchase, for the daily feeding of a Brahmana in the temple. The inscription has been assigned to Aditya I on account of the high rengal year of the king and the identity of the donor with the one figuring in No. 224 of 1915 of the time of Parantaka I (M.E.R. 1916 II. 9). It is surmised that the village owed its origin to Rajamalla an early king of the Western Ganga dynasty. (See No. 292 above.)

**No. 323.**

**(A.R. No. 14 of 1920.)**

**Tirumalavadi, Udaiyarpalaiyam Taluk, Trichinopoly District.**

**On the north wall of the central shrine, Vaidyanatha temple.**

The records a gift of 10 kalanju of gold and a bronze lamp-stand for burning a perpetual lamp in the temple of Perumanadigal at Tirumalavadi by Ilangon Pichchi, the Senior queen of Solapperumanar and the daughter of Vallavaraiyar. In M.E.R. 1920, II, 9, this inscription has been attributed to Rajaraja I, on account of the details of date given init, viz., Tula, Saturday, Bharani. This seems to receive support from the mention of Vallavarayar in the record, pusumably the same as Vallavaraiyar Vandyadevar the husband of Rajarajaâ€™s elder sister Kundavaiyar, both to whom largely figure in the Tanjore inscriptions of Rajaraja. It is curious however that in record of such a late period of this reign like this one, the historical introduction of the king should have been omitted. It may be mentioned here that the details of the date also correspond to A.D. 897, October 15, which falls into the reign of Adiya I. â€˜Vallavaraiyarâ€™ might refer to the Rashtrakuta king of that period (See Ep. Ind., Vol. XXVI, p. 233).

**No. 324.**

**(A.R. No. 15 of 1920.)**

**On the west wall of the same shrine.**

This records an endowment of 3 Â½ ma of land after purchasing it tax-free from the assembly (perunguri-sabhai) of Maripidugu-chaturvedimangalam by Nakkan Singan the headman of Purisai in parivandatturai, the eastern division of Arkattu-kurram, for burning a perpetual lamp in the temple of Malapadi-Mahadeva. The high rengal year of the king suggests that the inscription might be one of Aditya I.

**No. 325.**

**(A.R. No. 125 of 1929.)**

**Lalgudi, Lalgudi Taluk, Trichinopoly District.**

**On the north wall of the central shrine, Saptarishisvara temple.**

This records an endowment of land left in charge of the sabha of the village Nityavinitamangalam, after making it free of all taxes by payment of a lump sum to it, by a certain Brahmadhiraja for burning a perpetual lamp in the temple of Isvara Bhattaraka at Tiruttavatturai in Idaiyaru-nadu. The early characters of the inscription and the high regnal year of the king make the record assignable to Aditya I.
