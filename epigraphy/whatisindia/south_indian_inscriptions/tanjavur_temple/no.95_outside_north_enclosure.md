**TANJAVUR Brihadhiswara TEMPLE Inscriptions**

**INSCRIPTIONS ON THE WALLS OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE**

**No. 95. On the outside of the north enclosure.[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.95_outside_north_enclosure.html#_ftn1)**

This is not a fresh inscription but only a continuation of No. 64, where the first two lines of it are published. A separate number has been given to it here in order to facilitate fen. Like Nos. 63 and 94 the subjoined inscription is a list of shepherds who had to supply ghee for lamps to the Rajarajesvara temple. The former contain a list of allotments to various shepherds from the cattle presented to the temple by Rajarajadeva himself,[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.95_outside_north_enclosure.html#_ftn2) while in Nos. 64 and 95, the cattle given by the king, those given by other donors and those which were represented by funds as *kasu* and *akkam* deposited in the temple treasury for purchase of cattle,[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.95_outside_north_enclosure.html#_ftn3) are assigned to various shepherds under the same conditions as have been specified in No. 63. Accordingly, Nos. 64 and 95 have to be treated as a continuation of No. 63.

As in No. 94, the shepherds residing in the vicinity of Tanjore received a large number of cows and ewes. The following streets and other localities near Tanjore are mentioned in this connection:â€” Gandharva-teru, Anaikkaduvar-teru, Anaiyatkal-teru, Panmaiyar-teru, Virasorapperunderu, Rajavidyadhyarapperunderu, Tribhuvanamadevipperangadi, Uyyakkondanterinda-tirumanjanattar velam, Rajaraja-terinda-Pandi-tirumanjanattar-velam, Uttamasiliyar velam, Abhimanabhushana-terinda-velam, Panchacanmadeviyar-velam[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.95_outside_north_enclosure.html#_ftn4) and Sivadasansolai *alias* Rajaraja-Brahma-maharajanpadaividu.[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.95_outside_north_enclosure.html#_ftn5) Raudramahakalattu-madavilagam[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.95_outside_north_enclosure.html#_ftn6) (paragraph 5) and Brahmakuttam (paragraph 6) were evidently called after the temple situated in each of them. Of these two, Brahmakuttam is already known to us from No. 66 above. The foregoing street, temples and other quarters of the town are said to have been outside (*purambadi*) Tanjavur. Saliyatteru (paragraph 7 and 16) and Pandivelam (paragraphs 31 and 48) are the only localities mentioned as having been inside (*ullalai*) Tanjavur.

In describing the villages of shepherds who did not belong to Tanjore or its neighborhood, the following territorial divisions are mentioned: â€” Pandyakulasani-valanadu, Rajendrasimha-valanadu, Rajaraja-valanadu, Nittavinoda-valanadu, Kshatriyasikhamani-valanadu.[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.95_outside_north_enclosure.html#_ftn7) Keralantaka-valanadu, Vada-Konadu[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.95_outside_north_enclosure.html#_ftn8) and Kshatriyasikhamani-valanadu were called after the surnames Keralantakan and Kshatriyasikhamani probably of the king himself. As regards some of the other names see p. 437 above.

Donations in the shape of money, she-buffaloes, cows and ewes are referred to as having been made by the kingâ€™s officers and other individuals and groups of men for burning lamps in the temple. Among the donors are a number of people who appear to have contributed under special circumstances. Military operations are evidently going on, perhaps towards the chose of Rajarajaâ€™s reign, at Kori, *i.e.,* Uraiyur, the ancient Chola capital. A number of the kingâ€™s officers who were in some way or other connected with the battle were probably afraid they would be disgraced by the king for the part they had played in it. These officers seem to have vowed to put up lamps in the temple in case they escaped from being disgraced. The names of 14 donors for the maintenance of such lamps are mentioned. Eight of them have the title *perundaram* prefixed to their names, *viz.* (1) Uttarangudaiyan[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.95_outside_north_enclosure.html#_ftn9) Kon Vidividangan *alias* Villavan-Muvendavelan ; (2) Marayan Rajarajan ; (3) Kandarachchan Pattalagan *alias* Nittavinoda-Virupparaiyan ; (4) Alatturudaiyan Kalan Kannappan *alias* Rajakesari Muvendavelan ; (5) Lokamarayan ; (6) Rajakesari-Muvendavelan;[\[10\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.95_outside_north_enclosure.html#_ftn10) (7) VayiriSangaran ; (8) Kovan Tayilayyan. The proper name of a ninth person with the same title is lost. Three out of the fourteen donors were arbitrators (*naduvirukkai seyda*) and were apparently brahmanas, *viz.,* (1) Savandi-Pattan Puvattan Puvattanar and (2) Suvara-Pattan Puvatta-Pattanar, of Kottaiyur, who were residing at Kamaravalli-chaturvedimangalam, a *brahmedeya* in Mirai-kurram, a subdivision of Rajendrasimhavalanadu and (3) Damodara-\[Pattan\] of Kadalangudi.[\[11\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.95_outside_north_enclosure.html#_ftn11) Ne of the donors was the *senapati* Kuravan Ulgalandan[\[12\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.95_outside_north_enclosure.html#_ftn12) *alias* Rajaraja-Maharajan. The last of the fourteen donors was Amudan Tevan *alias* Rajavidyadhara-Virupparaiyan of Sembangudi in Avur-kurram, a subdivision of Nittavinoda-valanadu.[\[13\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.95_outside_north_enclosure.html#_ftn13)

The foregoing donations were made apparently in fulfillment of vows. There were also others which were evidently made out of a desire to acquire merit. Two of the person mentioned in the preceding paragraph occur also among the voluntary donors *viz.,* (1) Amudan Tevan *alias* Rajavidyadhara-Virupparaiyan and (2) the *senapati* Kuravan Ulagalandan *alias* Rajaraja-maharajan. Three others whose names are already known to us from other Tanjore inscriptions are also mentioned among the voluntary donors, *viz.,* (1) Adittan Suryan *alias* Tennavan-Muven davelan, the headman of Poygai-nadu ; (2) Irayiravan Pallavayan *alias*  
Mummadi-Sora-Posan of Araisur in Pambuni-kurram, a subdivision of Nittavinoda-valanadu ; and (3) the royal secretary Karayil Eduttapadam, the headman of  
Rajakesarinallur.
