 **TANJAVUR Brihadhiswara TEMPLE Inscriptions**

**INSCRIPTIONS ON THE WALLS OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE**

**No. 79. On three pillars of the south enclosure.[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.79_83_pillars_south_enclosure.html#_ftn1)**

This inscription records that a native of Nallur *alias* Panchavanmadevi-chaturvedimangalam in Nallur-Nadu, a district of Nittavinoda-valanadu, set up a copper image of Durga-Paramesvari and presented a number of ornaments to it.

The preservation of the inscription is not very good. The second, third and fourth faces of the first pillar are mutilated. But the missing *aksharas* have been supplied in the majority of cases from the context.

**Translation.**
