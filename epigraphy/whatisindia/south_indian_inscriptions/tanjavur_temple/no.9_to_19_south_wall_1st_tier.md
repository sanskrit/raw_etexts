As the Dravidians generally pronounce initial *u* and *uv*, and as the change of *v* into *m* which is frequent in Malayalam (see Dr. Caldwellâ€™s *comparative Grammar,* 2^(nd) edition, p. 58), occurs in Tamil too (e.g., in maanam for vaanam â€˜the skyâ€™), Musangi might be identical with Uchchangi-durga, an ancient hill-fort in the Harpanahalli talluqa of the Bellary district.

[\[20\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.9_to_19_south_wall_1st_tier.html#_ftnref20) The technical meaning of *niyayam* (Sanskrit *nayaya*) is not apparent. Perhaps it stands for *niyasam* (Sanskrit *nyasa*), â€˜a deposit, pledge, mortgage,â€™ and has to be translated by â€˜dedicated (*to the god*).â€™
