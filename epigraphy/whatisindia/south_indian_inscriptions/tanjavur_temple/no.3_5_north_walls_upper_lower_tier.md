**TANJAVUR Brihadhiswara TEMPLE Inscriptions**

**INSCRIPTIONS ON THE WALLS OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE**

**No. 3** **On the south wall, lower tier**

This inscription is engraved in 38 sections of 15 lines each and contains a description of thirty sacred ornaments. These were made partly of gold and jewels from the temple treasury, and partly of pears, which Ko-Rajakesarivarman, *alias* Rajarajadeva, had given to the temple up to the 29^(th) year of his reign. Paragraphs 5 and 6 allude to gold, which the king had seized after conquering the Chera king and the Pandyas, and which he had presented to the temple.
