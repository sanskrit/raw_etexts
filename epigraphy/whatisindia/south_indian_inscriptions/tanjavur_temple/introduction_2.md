**INTRODUCTION**

Another group designated Panchadehamurtigal,[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/introduction_2.html#_ftn1) is mentioned in No. 30. It consisted of one image with ten arms in the center and four other images on the sides, each of the latter having one face and four arms. The former was 22 *viral* and four *torai* in height while the other four were only fourteen *viral* in height[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/introduction_2.html#_ftn2).

Lingapuranadeva described in No. 44 is worthy of notice as we very often find a representation of the scene in Siva temples. The Tanjore temple itself bears a sculpture on the west wall of the central shrine. The group is now known as Lingodbhava.[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/introduction_2.html#_ftn3) The story is that Brahma and Vishnu once had a dispute about their relative superiority. Both of them appeared before Siva who had assumed the shape of a huge *linga*. Vishnu had to find out the bottom and Brahma the top of this *linga*. The former became a boar and went on burrowing into the earth and the latter soared into the air in the shape of a swan to trace the top. Neither of them could achieve his object and accordingly it became evident that Siva was superior to both of them. In the group set up by queen Abhimanavalli, the gods Brahma and Vishnu figure. The latter is said to have the face of a boar. The swan form of Brahma is not mentioned. The group must have closely followed the representation in stone of the same scene on the west wall of the central shrine.

Tradition asserts that the hill at Tiruvannamalai in the South Arcot district represents the â€˜lingaâ€™ of the *Linga-purana.* Accordingly pilgrims who visit the temple at Tiruvannamalai have to circumambulate the hill itself. It is worth of note that the *linga* at Tiruvannamalai is believed to be one of five *lingas* which are supposed to consist of the five elements (*panchabhuta)*. The Ekamranatha temple at Cojeeveram has the *prithvilinga* (made of earth) and the Jambukesvara temple on the island of Srirangam the *ap-linga* (made of water). The *vayu-linga* (made of air) is at Kalahasti in the North Arcot district; the *akasa-linga* (made of space) at Chidambaram and the *tejo-linga* (made of light) at Tiruvannamalai in the South Arcot district. The ancient names of these five shrines offer no justification for this supposition. Apparently the idea of tracing them to the five elements is a comparatively recent one.

An image of Ardhanarisvara was set up by Krishnan Ramn. The image is often met with among the sculptures of Siva temples in Southern India, and is partly male and partly female. In one of the niches of the north wall of the central shrine of the Tanjore temple thee is a figure of Ardhanarisvara. This differs from the group described in No. 39, there being a bull in a former close to which the figure is standing. A later representation of Ardhanarisvara in the Madura temple has no bull. In the group set up by Krishnan Raman and the sculpture on the north wall of the central shrine the Isvara-half has two arms and the Uma-half only a single arm. In the Madura sculpture each of them has two arms. Hemadri in the *Vratakhanda* of his *Chaturvargachintamani* describes the figure of Ardhanarisvara as having four arms.[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/introduction_2.html#_ftn4) The group set up by Rajarajaâ€™s general was made of copper but the Uma-half was coated with brass. Closely connected with this group is No.47, which records the setting up of an image of Bhringisa with three arms and three legs by Kovan Annamalai *alias* Keralantaka-Virupparaiyan. It was the exclusive devotion of Bhringisa to the god Siva that led Parvati to seek union with her consort in the form of Ardhanarisvara.² This was perhaps the commencement of the worship of the deity in its feminine aspect.

In the group Umashitar described in No. 32, the god and goddess are separate images seated together and accompanied by a standing image of Subrahmanya and one of Ganapati. The donor was a certain Velan Adittan *alias* Parantaka-Pallavaraiyan*.* This group is probably the same as that now known under the name Uma-Mahesvara, though in the latter Subrahmanya and Ganapati do not generally figure.[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/introduction_2.html#_ftn5)

Queen Soramahadevi set up an image of Rishabhavahanadeva with the goddess Uma paramesvari and a bull (No. 46). The god Ganapati appears to have been a member of the group though he is not found in the usual representation of Rishabharudbamurti.\[6\] The image of Adavallan set up by queen Soramahadevi (No. 42), is a standing figure of the god with Muyalagan\[7\] under his feet. The image had four arms, nine braids of hair (jata), the goddess Ganga-bhattaraki, on the braided hair and seven flower garlands. The goddess Umaparamesvari who formed a part of the group was standing on a separate pedestal. This description corresponds to the representation of one of the many forms of Nataraja. Another queen of Rajarajadeva named Panchavan-Mahadevi set up an image of Siva in the dancing posture and called it Tanjai-Aragar (No.51).

The image was apparently standing with Musalagan under the foot on which the god stood; the other foot was apparently lifted upwards in dancing though this fact is not specifically stated. An image of Umaparamesvari and one of Ganapati were included in the group. The image of Patanjali and
