**TANJAVUR Brihadhiswara TEMPLE Inscriptions**

**INSCRIPTIONS ON THE WALLS OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE**

**No. 21. On the north wall, lower tier**

This inscription is dated â€˜on the seventh day of the year which was opposite to the fifty yearâ€™ of Tribhuvanachakravartin Konerinmai-kondan. As I have shown in a paper on the Tirunelli deed of Bhaskara Ravivarman, which will shortly appear in the Indian Antiquary, the word â€˜oppositeâ€™ (edir) is used in Tamil dates in the sense of â€˜after.â€™ â€˜Accordingly, this inscription is dated in the year which followed after the fifth year, i.e., in the sixth year of the kingâ€™s reign. The name of the king has remained a puzzle and has been misread in various ways, until my assistant discovered an archaic inscription at Kuttalam near Mayavaram, in which it is spelt. This spelling, â€” if compared with the usual forms, and â€“ shows that the first part of the name must be divided into. From the assimilated form which occurs in an inscription at Pallavaram, we may further conclude that is meant for must be dissolved into â€˜a kingâ€™ â€˜equality,â€™ and is an abstract of the root, which signifies negation. Ko-ner-l-mai-kondan may thus be translated by â€˜he who has assumed the title â€œking of kings,â€?â€™ a surname of the Chera king Bhaskara Ravivarman, to whose reign the Cochin deed of the Jews[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.21_22_north_wall_lower_tier.html#_ftn1) belongs. Koneril or Koneril appears to have been corrupted subsequently into Koneri. For, we find the surname Koneri-mel-kondan or Koneri-men-konda applied to Vira-Chola and to Kulottunga-Choladeva ; and on a coin,[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.21_22_north_wall_lower_tier.html#_ftn2) copies of which are not rarely met with at Tanjore and Madura, the legend is Koneri-rayan.

The title Konerinmai-kondan is applied to the Chola king Rajarajadeva in the large Leyden grant (line 112) ; to Kulottunga-Choladeva in an inscription at Karuvur ; and to Sundara-Pandya in an inscription of the Madura temple,[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.21_22_north_wall_lower_tier.html#_ftn3) in the cave-inscription at Tirupparankunram,[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.21_22_north_wall_lower_tier.html#_ftn4) in the smaller Tiruppuvanam grant,[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.21_22_north_wall_lower_tier.html#_ftn5)
and in inscriptions at Perur.[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.21_22_north_wall_lower_tier.html#_ftn6) The same surname was borne by Vira-Pandya and by Kulasekharadeva.[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.21_22_north_wall_lower_tier.html#_ftn7) The king to whose reign the present inscription belongs, must be different from, and considerably later than, Rajarajadeva, whose inscriptions are written in archaic characters, while those of the subjoined inscription are not very far removed from the modern Tamil ones. There is no such objection to identifying the Konerinmai-kondan of the subjoined inscription with one of the three Pandya kings, who had that surname. But it is impossible to make any final identification, as the inscription does not contain any historical particulars about the king to whose reign it belongs.

The inscription records an order of the king, by which certain lands, that had been wrongfully sold during the third and fourth years of his reign, were restored to the temple of Rajaraja-Isvara at Tanjavur.

**No. 22. On the South wall, first and second tiers.**

This inscription is dated on the 64^(th) day of the 35^(th) year of the reign of Tribhuvanachakravartin Konerinmai-mondan and records the grant of the village of Sungandavirtta-Soranallur,[\[14\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.21_22_north_wall_lower_tier.html#_ftn14) which formed part of the town of Karundittaikudi,[\[15\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.21_22_north_wall_lower_tier.html#_ftn15) and which was situated on both banks of the Vira-Sora-Vadavaru[\[16\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.21_22_north_wall_lower_tier.html#_ftn16) and on the north-western extremity of the city of Tanjavur. The village was divided into 108 shares, of which 106 were to be enjoyed by the Brahmanas of the village of Samantanarayana-chaturvedimangalam near Tanjavur, and 2 by the temple of Samantanarayana-Vinnagar-Emberuman in this village. Both this village and this temple had been called after his own name, and the granted village had been purchased from its former owners, by a person, who is designated in the text as the Tondaimanar, but whose proper name must accordingly have been Samantanarayana. He was apparently a feudatory or high officer of the king, who made the grant at his instance and on his behalf. At the present time the title of Tondaiman is borne by the chiefs of the state of Pudukkottai in the Trichinopoly district. Their ancestor is reported to have ousted one Pallavarayan Tondaiman about 1680 A.D.[\[17\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.21_22_north_wall_lower_tier.html#_ftn17) This chief was probably a descendant of Samantanarayana Tondaiman and of Karunakara Tondaiman, who, according to the Tamil poem Kalingattu-Parani,[\[18\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.21_22_north_wall_lower_tier.html#_ftn18) was king of the Pallavas, resided at Vandai[\[19\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.21_22_north_wall_lower_tier.html#_ftn19) and was the prime minister of the Chola king Kulotltunga. The title Tondaiman means the king of Tondai[\[20\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.21_22_north_wall_lower_tier.html#_ftn20) or Tondaimandalam, the Tamil name of the Pallava country, the ancient capital of which was Kanchipuram. The numerous Chola inscriptions found at this town prove that the Pallava kingdom must have fallen a prey to the Cholas. From the kalingattu-Parani it further appears, that the former rulers of Tondaimandalam were allowed to retain possession of their dominions as feudatories. In the subjoined inscription they appear in the same position during the time of Konerinmai-kondan.

The chief difficulty in this inscription are the numerous fiscal terms mentioned in connection with the grant. A good many of them had to be left untranslated,[\[21\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.21_22_north_wall_lower_tier.html#_ftn21) while the translation of others is only tentative.
