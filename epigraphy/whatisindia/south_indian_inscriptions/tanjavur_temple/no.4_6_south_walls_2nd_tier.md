**TANJAVUR Brihadhiswara TEMPLE Inscriptions**

****

**INSCRIPTIONS ON THE WALLS OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE**

**No. 4. On the south wall, second tier**

The preserved part of this inscription comprises eight sections of nine lines each. The end of each line of the third section, the commencement of each line of the fourth section, and the whole of any other section, which may have intervened between the third and fourth, are covered by flight of steps, which was constructed at a period subsequent to that, during which the inscription had been incised.

The inscription specifies the revenue in paddy and the revenue in gold and in money (*kasu*), which a number of villages had to pay to the stone-temple, called Rajarajesvara, which Rajarajadeva had caused to be built at Tanjavur.[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.4_6_south_walls_2nd_tier.html#_ftn1) The villages were situated both in the Chola country and in other countries and had been assigned to the temple by Rajarajadeva until the 29^(th) year of his reign. The extent of the land, which the king had given to the temple in each of the villages, is recorded in great detail, by a land measure, the name of which is not stated, land by fractions of it. The paddy due to the temple and to be measured by â€˜the *marakkal[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.4_6_south_walls_2nd_tier.html#_ftn2)* called (*after*) Adavallanâ€™ *i.e.,* by a corn measure which was preserved at the shrine of the god Adavallan; [\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.4_6_south_walls_2nd_tier.html#_ftn3) and this *marakkal* was â€˜equal to a *rajakesari*.â€™ This term was evidently derived from Rajakesari, the surname of the reigning king Rajaraja and of other Chola kings,[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.4_6_south_walls_2nd_tier.html#_ftn4) and must be taken as the real name of the royal standard measure,[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.4_6_south_walls_2nd_tier.html#_ftn5) a copy of which was preserved at the temple. The only case, in which the revenue had to be paid in gold, occurs in paragraph 13. No instance of payment in money (*kasu*) occurs in the preserved part of the inscription.

**No.6. On the south wall, second tier** 

This and the next inscription, though of different date, are engraved continuously in two sections. No. 6 fills the whole of the first section and part of the first line of the second section.

The inscription describes a number of gifts, which were made until the 29^(th) year of the reign of Ko-Rajakesarivarman, *alias* Rajarajadeva, by Arvar Parantakan Kundavaiyar, who was the elder sister of Rajarajadeva and the queen of Vallavaraiyar Vandyadevar. As, according to the large Leyden grant,[\[32\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.4_6_south_walls_2nd_tier.html#_ftn32) Rajaraja was the son of Parantaka II., it is evident that the name of his sister, *Parantakan Kundavaiyar*, is an abbreviation for *Parantakan magal Kundavaiyar, i.e.,* Kundavaiyar, the daughter of Parantaka (II.).

Paragraph 2 records a gift of gold to the same two goddesses, who are mentioned in the inscription No.2.[\[33\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.4_6_south_walls_2nd_tier.html#_ftn33) According to paragraph 1, these two images had been set up in the temple of Rajarajesvara by Kundaaiyar herself. The same princess had set up an image of her mother, to which she presented certain ornaments (paragraphs 3 to 5). Other ornaments were given to the image of the god Dakshina-Meru-Vitankar (paragraphs 6 and 7), which had been set up by king Rajarajadeva (paragraph 1), and to his consort (paragraphs 8 and 9), who was one of the two goddesses referred to in paragraph 2. The remainder of the inscription treats of endowments to these two goddesses (paragraph 10), to the image of Ponmaligaittunjina-devar (paragraph 14), and to the image of the mother of Kundavaiyar (paragraph 19). These endowments were made in the following manner. Kundavaiyar deposited certain sums of money (*kasu*), which were subsequently borrowed on interest by the inhabitants of certain villages from the shrine of Chandesvara (paragrah 1), the saint in whose name the money affairs of temples are generally transacted.[\[34\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.4_6_south_walls_2nd_tier.html#_ftn34) The interest had to be paid yearly into the treasury of the Rajarajesvara temple at Tanjavur either in paddy[\[35\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.4_6_south_walls_2nd_tier.html#_ftn35) or in money. In the former case, the interest was three *kuruni* of paddy for each *kasu*, and in the latter 12 Â½ percent. If it is assumed that the rate of interest was the same in both cases, one *kasu* would correspond to the value of 24 *kuruni* or 2 *kalam* of paddy. In two instances (paragraphs 18 and 21), money was deposited for purchasing a number of sheep, from the milk of which two private individuals had to supply daily a certain amount of ghee for lamps.[\[36\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.4_6_south_walls_2nd_tier.html#_ftn36)
The value of one sheep was reckoned as 1/3 *kasu.* In paragraphs 14 and 19, the value of various daily requirements is given in measures of paddy; the whole list probably represents the daily wants of a single *punjari.*
