**TANJAVUR Brihadhiswara TEMPLE Inscriptions**

**INSCRIPTIONS ON THE WALLS OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE**

**No. 36. On the first niche of the west enclosure, first inscription.**

This inscription records, that the chief manager of the Rajarajaesvara temple dedicated a brass spittoon to an image of Pillaiyar[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.36_40_1st_niche_west_enclosure.html#_ftn1) Ganapati. From an inscription on the first pillar of the west enclosure, which is partially covered by a mud wall, it appears that this image had been set up by king Rajarajadeva before the 29^(th) year of his reign. It was made of copper and measured 14 *viral* in height.

**No. 37. On the first niche of the west enclosure, second inscription.**

This inscription records, that king Rajarajadeva deposited a sum of money, which was lent to the inhabitants of four *bazars* at Tanjavur in 29^(th) year of his reign. Instead of the interest, these people had to supply daily a fixed number of plantains to the image of Pillaiyar Ganapati, which is mentioned in the preceding inscription.

**No. 38.** **On the first niche of the west enclosure, third inscription.**

This inscription describes seven images, which had been set up before the 29^(th) year \[of the reign of Rajarajadeva\] by the same manager of the Rajarajesvara temple, who is mentioned in the inscription No. 26, and a number of ornaments, which had been given to these images by the same person (paragraphs 23 to 50) and by the inhabitants of two towns (paragraphs 51 and 59). The images represented Nambi-Aruranar (paragraphs 2, 23, 55, 59), Nangai-Paravaiyar (5, 25, 57, 66), Tirunavukkaraiyar (8, 29, 53), Tirunanasambandadigal (11, 36, 51), Periya-Perumal (14, 44), his consort Lokamahadevi (17, 47), and the god Chandrasekhara[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.36_40_1st_niche_west_enclosure.html#_ftn8) (20). Of these, Periya-Perumal, â€˜the great king,â€™ and his consort Lokamahadevi are perhaps identical with king Rajarajadeva and his queen Lokamahadevi,[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.36_40_1st_niche_west_enclosure.html#_ftn9) both of whom may have been represented as worshipping the god Chandrasekhara, *i.e.,* Siva, in whose honour the king had built the temple.

The inscription is of great importance for the history of Tamil literature, as kit forms a *terminus ad quem* for the time of the reputed authors of the *Devaram* or *Muvar-padal,* a collection of hymns in honour of Siva. Dr. Caldwell[\[10\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.36_40_1st_niche_west_enclosure.html#_ftn10) was inclined to assign this poem to the end of the thirteenth century. But the present inscription shows, that it must have been written before the time of Rajarajadeva. For the inscription mentions each of the three authors of the *Devaram, viz.,* Tirunanasambandar, Tirunavukkaraiyar (*alias* Appar) and Nambi-Aruranar (*alias* Sundaramurti), also the latterâ€™s wife Nangai-Paravaiyar.

\>

It is not improbable, that the sixty-three *Tiruttondar* or Saiva devotees, among whom the three authors of the *Devaram* are reckoned, belong to a much earlier period than that of Rajarajadeva. For one of them, who is mentioned along with the rest in Sundaramurtiâ€™s humns,[\[11\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.36_40_1st_niche_west_enclosure.html#_ftn11) was Kochchengannan,[\[12\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.36_40_1st_niche_west_enclosure.html#_ftn12) the son of the Chola king Subhadeva and of his queen Kamalavati.[\[13\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.36_40_1st_niche_west_enclosure.html#_ftn13) This Kochchengannan appears to be identical with the Chola king Sengan, the hero of Poygaiyarâ€™s contemporaneous Tamil poem kalavari, which w as recently translated by Mr. V. Kanakasabhai Pillai.[\[14\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.36_40_1st_niche_west_enclosure.html#_ftn14) The same scholar has published extracts from a latter tamil poem, the *Kalingattu-Parani,* which alludes successively, without mentioning the names themselves, to the three Chola kings Kokkilli Kochchengannan and Karikala.[\[15\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.36_40_1st_niche_west_enclosure.html#_ftn15) In the two only copperplate grants, which contain a genealogical account of the Chola dynasty, the same three kings are mentioned, though in different order, as ancestors of Vijayalaya, the grandfather of Parantaka I. The grant of the Bana king Hastimalla[\[16\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.36_40_1st_niche_west_enclosure.html#_ftn16) enumerates them thus; \_ Kokkilli, Karikala and Kochchamkan; and in the large Leyden grant, they are arranged as follows: â€” Karikala, Kochchamkannan and Kokkilli. To the time of Karikala or, as he is also called in Tamil,, Karikal belongs the Tamil poem *Pattinappalai* by Rudrangannanar,[\[17\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.36_40_1st_niche_west_enclosure.html#_ftn17) and to that of Sengan the above-mentioned *Kalavari.[\[18\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.36_40_1st_niche_west_enclosure.html#_ftn18)* As poems in the Tamil language are thus proved to have been composed in the time of the early Cholas, there is no objection to assigning the authors of the *Devaram* to the same period.

The legendary history of the sixty-three *Tiruttondar*, â€” and among these, of the three authors of the *Devaram*, â€” is narrated in the Periyapuranam by Sekkirar, who is said to have composed it during the reign of the Chola king Anapaya. The Tyagarajasvamin temple at Tiruvarur[\[19\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.36_40_1st_niche_west_enclosure.html#_ftn19) contains an inscription of this king. The name Anapaya occurs in each of two Sanskrit verses at the end of the inscription; while in the introductory passage the king is called Ko-Rajakesarivarman, *alias* Tribhuvanachakravartin Sri-Kulottunga-Choladeva. In the 7^(th) year of his reign, he made gifts to four images, which had been set up in the Tiruvarur temple. As in the Tanjavur inscription, these were images of Aludaiya-Nambi (*i.e.,* Sundaramurti), Paravai-Nachchiyar (the latterâ€™s wife),[\[20\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.36_40_1st_niche_west_enclosure.html#_ftn20) Aludaiya-Pillaiyar (*i.e.,* Tirunanasambandar) and Tirunavukkarasudevar. The concluding portion of the inscription runs thus: -

â€œKing Anapaya, whose head glitters when placed at the feet of the lord of the Golden Hall, gave land, gold, brass, silver (*and*) other excellent treasures to the blessed Brahmapurisa, Vagadhipati and Svasvamimitra at the shrine of the blessed lord of Arur.

â€œI, called Anapaya, the bee at the lotus feet of Natesa (*i.e.,* Siva) at the Golden Hall in the excellent Vyaghragrahara,[\[21\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.36_40_1st_niche_west_enclosure.html#_ftn21) bow my head at the lotus feet of (future) princes, who are disposed to protect the charitable gifts made at Lakshmyalaya[\[22\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.36_40_1st_niche_west_enclosure.html#_ftn22) by other (*kings*).[\[23\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.36_40_1st_niche_west_enclosure.html#_ftn23)

â€œThe mother of Aludaiya-Nambi (*was*) Isainaniyar.

â€œThe mother of the saint (*viz.,* Sundaramurti), called Nani, was born at this (*town of*) Kamalapura, in the family of Nanasivacharya, in the Saiva (*doctrine and*) in the *Gautama-gotra.â€?*

The above passage shows, that king Anapaya was a worshipper of the Siva temple at Chidambaram, and adds the name of Isainaniyar,[\[24\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.36_40_1st_niche_west_enclosure.html#_ftn24) the mother of Sundaramurti, to those of Brahmapurisa (*i.e.,* Tirunanasambandar), Vagadhipati (*i.e.,* Tirunavukkaraiyar) and Svasvamimitra (*i.e.,* Sundaramurti.)[\[25\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.36_40_1st_niche_west_enclosure.html#_ftn25)

Another inscription of the Tiruvarur temple, which is dated in the 5^(th) year of Ko-Parakesarivarman, *alias* Tribhuvanachakravartin Sri-Vikrama-Choladeva, contains a second reference to the subject of the *Periyapuranam*. From a written copy, which my assistant prepared during the few hours we could devote to the temple, it appears that the inscription relates to the legend of the calf, which was accidentally run over by the chariot of the son of the Chola king Manu. The same legend is located at Tiruvarur and told in other words in the introduction of the *Periyapuranam* (pages 10 to 12.)

**No. 40 On two pillars of the west enclosure.**

This short inscription is dated in the 3^(rd) year of the reign of Rajendra-Choladeva and records the setting-up of a copper image by the same manager of the Rajarajesvara temple, whose name we have found in two inscriptions of the 29^(th) year of the reign of Rajrajadeva.[\[35\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.36_40_1st_niche_west_enclosure.html#_ftn35)
It commands considerable interest, because it refers explicitly to the legend of one of the *Tiruttondar,* as preserved in the *Periyapuranam.[\[36\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.36_40_1st_niche_west_enclosure.html#_ftn36)* In the 6^(th) chapter of this book, we are told how Meypporunayanar, a Chedi (!) king residing at Tirukkovalur,[\[37\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.36_40_1st_niche_west_enclosure.html#_ftn37) was stabbed by his enemy Muttanadan, who had managed to obtain a private interview in the disguise of a *Saiva* devotee. The door-keeper Tattan, who intended to kill the murderer, was prevented by the dying king, who exclaimed: â€” â€œOh Tattan ! He is a devotee of Siva; therefore do not harm him!â€? â€“ or, as expressed in the verse which is prefixed to the story : â€” â€œ(*He is*) one of us, oh Tattan!â€? In the subjoined inscription, the corresponding words are: â€” â€œOh Tattan! (*He is*) one of us; see!â€? â€” [\[38\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.36_40_1st_niche_west_enclosure.html#_ftn38) and the person who utters them, is called Milad-udaiyar, â€˜the lord of Miladu.â€™ This designation of Meypporunayanar is synonymous with *Malada-mannar,* â€˜the king of the inhabitants of maladu,â€™[\[39\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.36_40_1st_niche_west_enclosure.html#_ftn39) in the opening verse, and with *Malaiya-manattarukku arasar,* â€˜the king of the inhabitants of the great country of hills,â€™ in the prose version.

In the introduction to No. 38, it was mentioned that Sekkirar, the author of the original poetical version of the *Periyapuranam,* wrote during the reign of the Chola king Anapaya, *alias* Kulottunga-Choladeva. The characters of the Tiruvarur inscription of this prince are decidedly more modern than those of the Tanjavur inscriptions of Rajaraja and Rajendra-Chola. Accordingly, the *Periyapuranam* must have been composed after their time. On the other hand, the subjoined inscription proves that the legends, which Sekkirar embodied in his work, were not of his own invention, but must have grown up in the time of the predecessors of Rajendra-Chola.
