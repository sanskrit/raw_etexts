**TANJAVUR Brihadhiswara TEMPLE Inscriptions**

**INSCRIPTIONS ON THE WALLS OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE**

**No. 94. On the outside of the north enclosure.**

This is not a fresh inscription but only a continuation of No. 63, where the first two lines of it are published.[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.94_outside_north_enclosure.html#_ftn1) For convenience of reference a separate number has been given to this portion of the inscription. It contains a list of shepherds who had to supply ghee for lamps to the Rajarajesvara temple. To each shepherd were assigned either 48 cows or 96 ewes. In a few cases the equivalent of the latter was given, *viz.* 8 she-buffaloes and 48 ewes (paragraphs 70, 71 and 73), 2 she-buffaloes and 84 ewes (paragraph 72) or 4 she-buffaloes and 72 ewes (paragraph 74). Evidently each she-buffalo was considered, as far as its milk-yielding capacity was concerned, equivalent to 6 ewes.[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.94_outside_north_enclosure.html#_ftn2) The names of each shepherdâ€™s dependents[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.94_outside_north_enclosure.html#_ftn3) who were held responsible for the supply of ghee are also mentioned.

Naturally, the shepherds residing in the neighborhood of Tanjore received a large number of she-buffaloes, cows and ewes. They belonged to ten streets, described as being outside (*purumbadi*) Tanjore, *viz.,* Gandharva-teru (*i.e.* the street of the musicians), Villigal-teru (*i.e.,* the street of the bowmen), Anaikkaduvar-teru (*i.e.,* street of those who cook for elephants), Anaiyatkal-teru (*i.e.* the street of the elephant troops), Panmaiyar-teru[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.94_outside_north_enclosure.html#_ftn4), Madaippalli-teru (*i.e.,* the street adjoining the temple kitchen) Virasorapperunderu, Rajavidyadharapperunderu, Jayangondasorapperunderu and Surasikhamanipperunderu, and to a eleventh street, described as being within (ullalai) Tanjore, *viz*. Saliyatteru (*i.e.* the weaversâ€™ street). The last four of the streets outside the town were evidently thoroughfares named after one or more members of the Chola family,[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.94_outside_north_enclosure.html#_ftn5) while the others appear to have been occupied either wholly or in part by people engaged in particular professions. Some of the shepherds belonged to three bazaars (*angadi*) said to be outside the town, *viz.,* Tribhuvanamadevipperangadi,[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.94_outside_north_enclosure.html#_ftn6) Kongavalar-angadi[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.94_outside_north_enclosure.html#_ftn7) and Rajaraja-Brahmamaharajan-angadi[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.94_outside_north_enclosure.html#_ftn8) ; and the rest of the following quarters also described as being outside the town :â€” Abhimanabhushanaterinda-velam, Uyyakkondan-terinda-tirumanjanattar-velam,[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.94_outside_north_enclosure.html#_ftn9) Uttamasiliyar-velam, Rajaraja-terina-Pandi-tirumanjanattar-velam and Arumorideva-terinda-tirupparigalattar[\[10\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.94_outside_north_enclosure.html#_ftn10) velam. Among these five long names of localities, Abhimanabhushana[\[11\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.94_outside_north_enclosure.html#_ftn11) Uyyakkondan, Uttamasili[\[12\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.94_outside_north_enclosure.html#_ftn12), Rajaraja and Arumorideva were all apparently the names or surnames of the king himself At any rate, we know for certain that Rajaraja and Arumorideva were borne by him.[\[13\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.94_outside_north_enclosure.html#_ftn13)

In case of the shepherds who did not belong to the city of Tanjore, the name of the village where each of them was living and the district in which it was situated are mentioned. Thus we get valuable information about the ancient geography of the Chola country. The following are the names of districts mentioned in this connection: â€” Arumorideva-valanadu, Pandyakulasani-valanadu, Nittavinoda-valanadu, Rajaraja-valanadu, Rajendrasinga-valanadu and Uyyakkondar-valanadu. The first member of each of the foregoing names, *viz.* Pandyakulasani, Nittavinoda and Rajendrasinga were probably surnames of the king himself. At any rate, we know from the large Leydlen plates (I. 70 f.) that Nityavinoda was a surname of Rajaraja.
