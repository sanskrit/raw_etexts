 **TANJAVUR Brihadhiswara TEMPLE Inscriptions**

**INSCRIPTIONS ON THE WALLS OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE**

**No.8 On the walls of the portico, second tier**

This inscription engraved on the southeast and north walls of a portico, which forms the main entrance on the east of the central shrine. The published text, which consists of three sections of nine lines each, ends in the middle of paragraph 26 with the statement, that the inscription is continued at the bottom of the south wall of the portico. Of this portion no copy could be taken, as the present pavement of the temple court rises to its level.

Like the preceding inscription, this one describes a number of ornaments of gold and jewels, which were presented by Arvar Parantakan Kundavaiyar until the 3^(rd) year of the reign of Ko-Parakesarivarman, *alias* Rajendra-Choladeva. The donees were the images which she had set up herself. Among these, the published part of the inscription mentions the consort of Dakshina-Meru-Vitankar (paragraph 2) and the consort of Tanjai-Vitankar (paragraphs 8 and 24).
