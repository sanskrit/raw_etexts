**TANJAVUR Brihadhiswara TEMPLE Inscriptions**

**INSCRIPTIONS ON THE WALLS OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE**

**No. 29. On a pillar of the east enclosure, to the right of the gopura.[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.29_35_pillar_east_enclosures.html#_ftn1)**

This inscription describes a number of copper images, which king Rajarajadeva had set up in the Rajarajesvara temple before the 29^(th) year of his reign. These images were probably arranged in two groups, which represented two successive scenes from the life of the *Saiva* saint Chandesvara, as described in the *Periyapuranam.[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.29_35_pillar_east_enclosures.html#_ftn2)* The first group may have consisted of a *linga* (Mahadeva, paragraph 8), of a statue of Chandesvara who worshipped it (paragraph 10), and of one of his father,[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.29_35_pillar_east_enclosures.html#_ftn3) who was killed by his own son, because he obstructed the worship of Siva (paragraph 11). The second group was probably composed of Siva and his consort (paragraph 2 and 5), and of Chandesvara (paragraph 12), who received a flower-garland from Siva as a reward for his devotion (paragraph 13).

This inscription opens with the same Sanskrit *sloka* as No.1. The remaining portion, which is in Tamil, records that the enclosure of the temple was built by order of king rajarajadeva, and under the superintendence of the commander of his army, Krishna Rama. The same person is mentioned three times in the large Leyden grant.

**No. 33 On a niche of the south enclosure**

This is another copy of the inscription No. 31.

**No. 34 On a niche and a pillar of the south enclosure**

This inscription records that Lokamahadevi, a queen of Rajarajadeva, set up a copper image of Pichchadevar, to which she presented a number of ornaments (*paragraphs 9 to 19*) and two vessels of gold and silver (*paragraphs 20 and 21*). The image was set up before the 29^(th) year \[of the reign of Rajarajadeva\] and is referred to as having been set up by the queen in the inscription No.9, which belongs to the 6^(th) year of the reign of Rajendra-Choladeva. From its attendants and attributes which are mentioned in the present inscription, â€” a goblin (*bhuta*), an antelope and a skull (*paragraphs 3, 5 and 21*), â€” it may be concluded that the image was one of siva.[\[10\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.29_35_pillar_east_enclosures.html#_ftn10)

**Translation**

1\. Hail ! Prosperity! There was engraved on stone (1) the money, which the Vala\[n\]-gai-paramba\[dai\]galilar[\[18\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.29_35_pillar_east_enclosures.html#_ftn18) of the lord Sri-Rajarajadeva had deposited until the twenty-ninth year (*of the reign)* of the lord Sri-Rajarajadeva for the offerings and other expenses required by (*the image of*) Pichchadevar, which was attached to them (*and*) which had been set up in the temple of the lord Sri-Rajarajesvara by Lokamahadevi, the consort of our lord, and (2) the village, which had received this money on interest.

2\. Seven hundred and forty-three *kasu* were deposited (*under the condition*) that, as long as the moon and the sun endure, an interest of three *kuruni* of paddy per year for each *kasu* should be delivered into the large treasury of the lord (*at*) Tanjavur, so as to realize one hundred and eighty-five *kalam*, seven *kuruni* and four *nari* of paddy per year,[\[19\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.29_35_pillar_east_enclosures.html#_ftn19) or (one) *tuni,* (*one*) padakku, one *nari* and (*one*) *uri* per day of paddy (*measured*) by the *marakkal* called (*after*) Adavallan. (*of this daily rat*e) two nari of old rice for boiling (a*re required*) by (*the image of*) Pichchadevar at sunrise, four *nari* of old rice for boiling at noon, and two *nari* of old rice for boiling at night ; altogether, (*one*) *kuruni* of old rice for boiling, or, â€” as five (*measures of paddy*) yield two (*measures of rice*), â€” (*on*e) *padakku* and four *nari* of old paddy for boiling. The increment (*vasi*) of one eighth[\[20\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.29_35_pillar_east_enclosures.html#_ftn20) *(which has to be added*) to the old paddy for boiling, (*comes to*) two *nari* and (*one*) *uri* of paddy.

[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.29_35_pillar_east_enclosures.html#_ftnref2) Page 81 of the Madras edition of 1888.

[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.29_35_pillar_east_enclosures.html#_ftnref3) He is called Echchadattan (*i.e.,* Yajnadatta) in the *Periyapuranam*.

[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.29_35_pillar_east_enclosures.html#_ftnref4) *I.e.,* â€˜Siva, represented in the act of conferring a boon (*prasada*) on Chandesvara ;â€™ compare paragraphs 12 and 13 of this inscription.

[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.29_35_pillar_east_enclosures.html#_ftnref5) This word may be either connected with the Sanskrit *musala,* â€˜a pestle, a club,â€™ or with the Tamil *musal,* â€˜a hare.â€™ In the Tanjavur inscriptions, Musalagan is always represented as lying on the ground. In No. 50, paragraph 7, and in No. 51, paragraph 2, it is distinctly stated that he was lying under the foot of Siva. He therefore appears to be a demon who was conquered by the god.

[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.29_35_pillar_east_enclosures.html#_ftnref6) This pronoun refers to paragraph 2.

[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.29_35_pillar_east_enclosures.html#_ftnref7) On similar surnames see p. 125, note 2. In the large Leyden grant the same surname of Krishna Rama oclcurs twice (lines 131 and 163), while he is called Rajendra-Sora-brahma-m\[a\*\]rayan at the end of that inscription (line 437 f.). In the first two instances, he is designated as chief secretary (*olai-nayakan*) of Rajaraja, who, according to an inscription at Melpadi (No. 87 of my *Progress Report for October* 1889 to *January* 1890, G.O., dated 11^(th) March 1890, NO. 189, Public) had the surname Mummudi-Soradeva. Consequently, the first surname of Krishna Rama means â€˜the great king of the Brahmanas of Mummadi-chola, *i.e.,* Mummudi-Chola or Rajaraja.â€™ The third occasion, on which Krishna Ramaâ€™s name occurs in the Leyden grant, shows that, after the accession of Rajendra-Chola, who issued the grant after the death of his father Rajaraja, the original surname was changed into â€˜the great king of the Brahmanas of Rajendra-Chola.â€™ This change is an additional proof of the identity of Rajendra-Chola with Madurantaka (Vol. I, p. 96).

[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.29_35_pillar_east_enclosures.html#_ftnref8)
This word means â€˜of high rankâ€™ and appears to be the designation of some office.

[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.29_35_pillar_east_enclosures.html#_ftnref9) This paragraph probably contained the measurements of the pedestal, on which the previously mentioned images were placed.

[\[10\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.29_35_pillar_east_enclosures.html#_ftnref10) Of the etymologies of Pichchadevar, which were proposed on page 90, note 6, that from Bhikshadeva appears now more probable.

[\[11\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.29_35_pillar_east_enclosures.html#_ftnref11) Compare No. 1, paragraph 3.

[\[12\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.29_35_pillar_east_enclosures.html#_ftnref12) The height of the upper pedestal is already stated in paragraph 2.

[\[13\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.29_35_pillar_east_enclosures.html#_ftnref13) The literal meaning of *idaikkattu* is â€˜a fastening in the middle.â€™

[\[14\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.29_35_pillar_east_enclosures.html#_ftnref14) In Part I the expression thadavikattina was translated by â€˜set into (it).â€™ Paragraph 10 of this inscription shows, that its technical meaning must be different from that of kattina â€˜set,â€™ which occurs immediately before it. I therefore translate it henceforth tentatively by â€˜fastened.â€™

[\[15\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.29_35_pillar_east_enclosures.html#_ftnref15) To these seven pieces were evidently attached the seven strings, of which the ornament consisted. In the next paragraph, there are only three strings, and consequently each *talimbam* is composed of three piece.

[\[16\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.29_35_pillar_east_enclosures.html#_ftnref16) These meanings of *padugan* and *kokkuvay* are established by several inscriptions of Part II. Cancel note 2 on page 19 of Part I.

[\[17\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.29_35_pillar_east_enclosures.html#_ftnref17) The technical meanings of Kadaligai, â€˜a flagâ€™ and of the next word are not known.

[\[18\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.29_35_pillar_east_enclosures.html#_ftnref18) See No. 9, paragraph 4.

[\[19\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.29_35_pillar_east_enclosures.html#_ftnref19) As stated in paragraph 3, 743 *kasu* at the rate of 3 *kuruni* per *kasu* yield 185 *kalams*, 2 *tuni* and 1 *kuruni* or or 1 *lu u I* and 4 *nari* in excess of the required amount.
