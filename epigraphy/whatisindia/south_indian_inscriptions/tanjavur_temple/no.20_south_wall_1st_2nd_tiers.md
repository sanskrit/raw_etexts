**TANJAVUR Brihadhiswara TEMPLE Inscriptions**

**INSCRIPTIONS ON THE WALLS OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE**

**No.20. On the south wall, first and second tiers**

This inscription records that, on the 242^(nd) day of the 19^(th) year of this reign, Rajendra-Choladeva granted a yearly allowance of paddy to a Saiva priest of the Rajarajesvara temple. He issued this order from his palace at Gangaikonda-Sorapuram.[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.20_south_wall_1st_2nd_tiers.html#_ftn1)

The most important part of the inscription is the end of its historical introduction, which adds a number of names of places, which the king had conquered between his 12^(th) and 19^(th) year, to those mentioned in two Tirumalai inscriptions of the 12^(th) year.[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.20_south_wall_1st_2nd_tiers.html#_ftn2) Among these additional names of localities I can identify none but the last, *viz.,* Kadaram (line 11), whose king, called Samgramavijayottungavarman, was attacked by sea and caught (II. 8 f). This king must have been a successor of Maravijayaottungavarman, the son of Chudamanivarman and king of Kataha or Kidaram, who is mentioned in the large Leyden grant[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.20_south_wall_1st_2nd_tiers.html#_ftn3) as a vassal of Rajaraja. Kidaram is now the headquarters of a talluqa of the Ramnad Zamindari in the Madura district.[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.20_south_wall_1st_2nd_tiers.html#_ftn4) The remaining names of localities, which I am unable to identify, must probably be looked for in the same neighborhood, as the inscription seems to imply that they were all taken from the king of Kadaram, together with Kadaram itself, which is the last item in the list.

At the beginning of each line of the second tier of this inscription, a few letters are lost. Most of these can be supplied with certainty from other inscriptions of Rajendra-Chola. Those letters which are lost at the beginning of lines 9 to 11, are taken from an undated inscription of the Kailasanatha temple at Uttaramallur. The Bilvanathesvara temple at Tiruvallam contains inscriptions of the 21^(st), 26^(th) and \[3\] 1^(st) years of Rajendra-Chola.[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.20_south_wall_1st_2nd_tiers.html#_ftn5) Owing to their imperfect preservation, these were of very little use for the restoration of the text. As the historical passage at their beginning adds nothing new to that of the subjoined inscription, they serve at least to prove, that Rajendra-Chola did not make any further conquests after the 19^(th) year of his reign.

[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.20_south_wall_1st_2nd_tiers.html#_ftnref3) Lines 81 f. and 117. an unnamed king of Kidaram is referred to as a vassal of Kulottunga-Choladeva in the small Leyden grant ; see Dr. Burgessâ€™s *Archaeological Survey of Southern India,* Vol. IV, p. 224, text line 5 f. and p. 225, text line 10.

[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.20_south_wall_1st_2nd_tiers.html#_ftnref4) Mr. Sewellâ€™s *Lists of Antiquities,* Vol. I, p. 299.

[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.20_south_wall_1st_2nd_tiers.html#_ftnref5) Nos.7, 13 and 17 of my Progress Report for October 1889 *to January* 1890, Madras G.O., 11^(th) March 1890, No. 189, Public.

[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.20_south_wall_1st_2nd_tiers.html#_ftnref6) Like the Tirumalai inscriptions, this inscription reads porukadal while Nos. 9 to 19 have poruthadar.

[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.20_south_wall_1st_2nd_tiers.html#_ftnref7) Instead of pukalodu the reading of Nos. 10 to 19, this inscription has pukalodum like the Tirumalai inscriptions.

[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.20_south_wall_1st_2nd_tiers.html#_ftnref8) In Vol. I, p. 99 vikramaveerar was taken as a proper name. From the analogy of other items in the list of conquests, I now consider it more probable that a general descriptive epithet is intended.

[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.20_south_wall_1st_2nd_tiers.html#_ftnref9) The Tirumalai inscriptions read â€œNamanaikkonam, which was surrounded by dense groves.â€?

[\[10\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.20_south_wall_1st_2nd_tiers.html#_ftnref10) The Tirumalai inscriptions read venjilaiveerar which I took to be a proper name, but now prefer to translate by â€œwhose warriors possessed cruel bows;â€? compare note 3, above.

[\[11\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.20_south_wall_1st_2nd_tiers.html#_ftnref11) Pasadai comes to the same as pasudai, the reading of the Tirumalai inscriptions.

[\[12\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.20_south_wall_1st_2nd_tiers.html#_ftnref12) This doubtful name might be a corruption of Indraratha. If the reading of the Tirumalai inscriptions, kulathiratharanai instead of kulathirathanai should turn out to be the correct one, the kingâ€™s name would be either Dhiratara or Iradaran (?)

[\[13\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.20_south_wall_1st_2nd_tiers.html#_ftnref13) Instead of muranusa a Chidambaram inscription reads muranara, which comes to the same.

[\[14\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.20_south_wall_1st_2nd_tiers.html#_ftnref14) The readings of the Tirumalai inscriptions, thodaukadarsangu kottan and sanguvodan, seem to be mere corruptions of the reading in the text.

[\[15\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.20_south_wall_1st_2nd_tiers.html#_ftnref15) Instead of malar, â€˜a flower,â€™ the Tirumalai inscriptions read manal â€˜sandâ€™.

[\[16\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.20_south_wall_1st_2nd_tiers.html#_ftnref16) Nethi seems to be used for nithi ; compare page 95, note 1.

[\[17\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.20_south_wall_1st_2nd_tiers.html#_ftnref17) As Sarva and Isana are synonymous, this person is perhaps identical with the *guru* Isanasiva-pandita, who is mentioned in No. 9, paragraphs 1 and 2.

[\[18\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.20_south_wall_1st_2nd_tiers.html#_ftnref18) Tiru-mantri olai is an abbreviation for *tiru-mantri olai erudum* which occurs in the inscription No. 27, paragraph 1. In the large Leyden grant, the words name olai yazhuthum, â€˜who writes our orders,â€™ and mandira-olai are prefixed to the name of one and the same person at two different places (lines 123 and 161 f.)
