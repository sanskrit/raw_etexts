**TANJAVUR Brihadhiswara TEMPLE Inscriptions**

**INSCRIPTIONS ON THE WALLS OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE**

**No. 96.** **In the second gopura of the temple, right of entrance.[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.96_97_right_entrance.html#_ftn1)**

The subjoined inscription is dated in the 3^(rd) year of the reign of Tribhuvanachakravartin Rajarajadeva, i.e., Rajaraja III. It does not record any gift, but registers a political compact entered into by three chiefs of the Chola country to be faithful to the king and to sand by each other. The compact shows that the Chola country was disturbed; perhaps by internal dissensions and the Chola capital Tanjore was not free from them. As this is dated in the 3^(rd) year of Rajaraja III., it may be presumed that the Chola country became disturbed already towards the end of the reign of Kulottunga III. Two such compacts belonging to about the same period are registered at Sengama in the South Arcot District.[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.96_97_right_entrance.html#_ftn2)

By Ulagudaiya-Nayanar Sripadam ( I â€“ 13 f. and 17 f.) Rajaraja III. Is probably meant.

**No. 97. In the second gopura of the temple, right of entrance.[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.96_97_right_entrance.html#_ftn6)**

The subjoined inscription records that the goldsmiths of Tanjore were exempted from taxes by the Nayaka chief Achyutappa-Nayaka, son of Sevvappa-Nayaka of Tanjore. It is dated in Saka-Samvat 1499 expired, the cyclic year Bahudhanya, corresponding apparently to A.D. 1578-79. Achyutappa-Nayaka was a feudatory of the Vijayanagara king Venkata I. The influence of the Tanjore Nayakas extended at one time as far as Tiruvannamalai in the South Arcot district.[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.96_97_right_entrance.html#_ftn7)

Let there be prosperity! Hail! Prosperity!

On the auspicious occasion of the prathamadvadasi[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.96_97_right_entrance.html#_ftn8), a Monday (corresponding to) the 1\[8\]th solar day of the month of Ani in the year Bahudhanya, which was current after (the expiry of) the Saka year 1499 â€“ (the following is) the charter (conveying) a lawful edict given by Achyutappa-Nayakkar Ayyan, (son of) Sevvappa-Nayakkar Ayyan to the goldsmiths of Tanjavur. At the request of KandanoluNarayaKurunadan (and) SingappalliNagabatta Seshastiri (i.e. perhaps Seshadri), your taxes (irai) have been caused to be remitted, and (this) shall continue as long as the moon and the sun (endure) as a remission of all taxes (sarvamanya). One who obstructs this charity shall incur the sin of having killed tawny cows on the bank of the Ganges. One who obstructs this charity shall incur the sin of having pulled out a thousand lingas.

[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.96_97_right_entrance.html#_ftnref2) See the Annual Report on Epigraphy for 1899-00, paragraphs 32 and 33.

[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.96_97_right_entrance.html#_ftnref3) The syllable ill added after the figure na has probably to be taken as an abbreviation of the word naal which must mean â€˜timeâ€™, as the number of the day of the year is not specified.

[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.96_97_right_entrance.html#_ftnref4) The term Kallikkudaiyan, Kilimangalamudaiyan and Sirumangalamudaiyan which occur in this inscription confirm my remarks on p. 459  
above note 1.

[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.96_97_right_entrance.html#_ftnref5) The words ulagudaiya nayanar sripadam are repeated unnecessarily in I. 17 f. What remains o II. 18 and 19 does not furnish any complete  
sentence.

[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.96_97_right_entrance.html#_ftnref6) No. 22 of 1897.

[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.96_97_right_entrance.html#_ftnref8) Prathamadvadasi is perhaps meant to denote the twelfth of the bright half of the month Ashadha, on which day the Chaturmasyavrata  
commences ; see Ind. Ant. Vol., XXVI, page 181.
