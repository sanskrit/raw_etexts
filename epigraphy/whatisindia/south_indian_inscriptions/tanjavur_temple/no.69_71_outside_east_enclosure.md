**TANJAVUR Brihadhiswara TEMPLE Inscriptions**

**INSCRIPTIONS ON THE WALLS OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE**

**No. 69. On the outside of the east enclosure.**

This inscription and the next following one (No. 70 are engraved on the right of the entrance to the second *gopura.*[*\[1\]*](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.69_71_outside_east_enclosure.html#_ftn1)
The inscription No. 69 consists of a list of villages which had to supply treasurers servants and accountants to the Rajarajesvara temple, in accordance with an order which Rajarajadeva had issued before the 29^(th) year of his reign. Paragraph 1 states that these villages were situated in the Chola country, in the Pandya country, land in Tondai-nadu which was surnamed Jayankonda-Chola-mandalam. Tondai-nadu or Tondai-mandalam is the ancient Tamil name of the Pallava country.[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.69_71_outside_east_enclosure.html#_ftn2) In Sanskrit inscriptions it occurs as Tondira-mandala, Tundira-mandala, and Tundaka-vishaya.[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.69_71_outside_east_enclosure.html#_ftn3) The present inscription proves that Jayankonda-Chola-mandalam, which is referred to in many inscriptions,[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.69_71_outside_east_enclosure.html#_ftn4) is another name of Tondai-mandalam. Jayankonda-Chola, from which this term is derived, must have been a surname of Rajaraja or of one of his predecessors. In the *Madras* *Christian College Magazine* for October 1890, Mr. Venkayya has shown that proper names, of which Jayankonda-Chola forms the first member, do not occur in inscriptions previous to the 29^(th) year of Rajarajaâ€™s reign, and concludes from this fact that Jayankonda-Chola was a surname of Rajaraja himself, assumed by him towards the close of his reign. The same surname was subsequently adopted by another Chola king, Ko-Rajakesarivarman, *alias* Rajadhirajadeva,[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.69_71_outside_east_enclosure.html#_ftn5) The form Jayankonda-Tonda-mandalam, which occurs in later inscriptions,[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.69_71_outside_east_enclosure.html#_ftn6) is evidently an abbreviation of â€œTondai-mandalam, *alias* Jayankonda-Chola-mandalam.â€?

The original of this inscription is much injured, and whole paragraphs of it are totally lost. To facilitate reference, I have numbered consecutively all those paragraphs, of which at least a portion is still preserved.
