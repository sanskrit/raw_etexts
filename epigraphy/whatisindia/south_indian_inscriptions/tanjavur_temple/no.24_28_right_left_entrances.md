**TANJAVUR Brihadhiswara TEMPLE Inscriptions**

**INSCRIPTIONS ON THE WALLS OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE**

**No. 24. In the inner gopura, on the left of the entrance**

This inscription is dated in the 29^(th) year of the reign of Ko-Rajakesarivarman, *alias* Rajarajadeva, and opens with the same historical passage as Nos. 1 to 3.[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.24_28_right_left_entrances.html#_ftn1) It records two deposits of money, which were made by an officer of king Rajarajadeva in favour of the chief idol of the Rajarajesvara temple, and of the image of Dakshina-Meru-Vitankar. The first deposit was lent to the inhabitants of a *bazaar* at Tanjavur, who had in exchange to supply cardamom seeds and *champaka* buds, and the second deposit to certain villagers, who had to supply *khaskhas* roots. These three kinds of drugs were used for scenting the bathing-water of the two gods.

**No. 26 In the inner gopura, on the right of the entrance**

The date and the historical introduction of this inscription are identical with those of No.24. It records two deposits of money, which were made by a manager of Rajarajesvara temple and lent out to the inhabitants of a certain village. The interest of the first deposit was to be paid in paddy and to be used for procuring various articles of consumption of thirteen yearly procession days. Paragraph 2 contains a list of these articles, which is as detailed as, and still more extensive than, the one given in the inscription No. 6, paragraphs 14 and 19. The interest of the second deposit was to be paid in money and to be used for purchasing camphor, which had to be burnt before the images of Rajarajesvara and Dakhina-Meru-Vitankar.
