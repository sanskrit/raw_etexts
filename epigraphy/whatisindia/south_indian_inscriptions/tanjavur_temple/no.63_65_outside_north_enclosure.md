**TANJAVUR Brihadhiswara TEMPLE Inscriptions**

**INSCRIPTIONS ON THE WALLS OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE**

**No. 63. On the outside of the north enclosure.**

From the published portion of No. 63, we learn that this inscription consists of a list of shepherds who had to supply ghee for temple lamps from the milk of a number of cattle, which had been presented to the temple before the 29^(th) year of the reign of Rajarajadeva by the king himself and by others, or bought from the funds of the temple. To each lamp were allotted 96 ewes,[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.63_65_outside_north_enclosure.html#_ftn1) or 48 cows, or 16 she-buffaloes. The daily supply for each lamp was one *urakku* of ghee.

**Translation.**

1\. Hail ! Prosperity! Until the twenty-ninth year (*of the reign*) of Ko-Rajakesarivarman, *alias* Sri-Rajarajadeva, who, in his life of growing strength, during which, â€” (*in*) the belief that, as well as the goddess of fortune, the goddess of the great earth had become his wife,â€” he was pleased to destroy the ships (*at*) Kandalur-Salai[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.63_65_outside_north_enclosure.html#_ftn2) the conquered by his army, which was victorious in great battles, Vengai-Nadu, Ganga-padi, Nulamba-padi, Tadigai-padi, Kudamalai-nadu, Kollam, Kalingam, Ira-mandalam, (*the conquest of which*) made (*him*) famous (*in*) the eight directions,[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.63_65_outside_north_enclosure.html#_ftn3) and the seven and a half *lakshas* of Iratta-padi, â€” deprived the Seriyas (*i.e.,* the Pandyas) of (*their*) splendour at the very moment when (*they were*) resplendent (*to such a degree*) that (they were) worthy to be worshipped everywhere ;[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.63_65_outside_north_enclosure.html#_ftn4) â€” cattle had been given by the lord Sri-Rajarajadeva[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.63_65_outside_north_enclosure.html#_ftn5) for (*burning*) sacred lamps before the lord of the Sri-Rajarajesvara (*temple*) ; (*other*) cattle had been given by (*other*) donors ; and (*other*) cattle were represented by funds (*mudal*),[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.63_65_outside_north_enclosure.html#_ftn6) as money (*kasu*) had been paid (*for their purchase into the temple treasury*). (*These*) cattle were assigned to shepherds (*Idaiyar*), who had to supply ghee for the sacred lamps (*from their milk*), at the rate of ninety-six ewes, or forty-eight cows, or sixteen she-buffaloes for each sacred lamp. Besides, calves and bulls which were given along with cows, (had to be reckoned) as cows; lambs and rams which were given along with ewes, as ewes; and buffalo calves and he-buffaloes which were given along with she-buffaloes, as she-buffaloes. The shepherds who had received the battle, themselves and their people, (*viz.,*) their relations, and the relations of the latter, had to supply ghee the treasury of the lord, as long as the moon and the sun endure, at the daily rate of (*one*) *urakku* of ghee by the Adavallan (*measure*) for each sacred lamp. (*The names of these shepherds*) were engraved on stone as follows: â€”

As appears from its 1^(st) paragraph, this inscription is a continuation of No. 63. The published portion of the 2^(nd) paragraph refers to a shepherd who had received 96 ewes,[\[10\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/tanjavur_temple/no.63_65_outside_north_enclosure.html#_ftn10) *viz.,* 69 ewes given by Rajarajadeva, and 27 ewes purchased for 9 *kasu*, in order to supply ghee for a temple lamp.
