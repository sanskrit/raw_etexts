PALLAVA INSCRIPTIONS

**PREFACE**

The inscriptions stored in the office of the Superintendent for Epigraphy from its inception in 1887 up to 1903 have been published in the order of their collection in the *South Indian Inscriptions* series (Texts), Volumes IV to VIII. Since the wealth of materials contained in these volumes is practically inaccessible to scholars not conversant with South Indian languages, a new scheme has been adopted for publishing the records collected subsequent to 1903 according to dynasties and in a chronological order with prefatory notes in English for each inscription drawing attention to its salient contents.

According to this scheme, Volume IX dealing with Kannada inscriptions from the Madras Presidency and Volume XI with those in the Bombay-Karnatak has so far been published. These represent the early Kanarese dynasties of the South like the Banas, the Vaidumbas, the Nolamba-Pallavas, the Western Chalukyas, etc. The Telugu inscriptions of the Madras Presidency are under publication in Volume X of the series.
The present volume (Volume XII) relating to the Pallavas is the *first Tamil* publication to be issued under the new scheme. It contains all the Pallava inscriptions collected by the Department from 1904 to 1935 and provides a wide ad definite scope for studying the history of this dynasty from original sources. Four appendices and an exhaustive index have been added at the end to facilitate reference. It is hoped that this volume, besides commending itself to the student of South Indian History and Epigraphy, will reach a wider circle of scholars and stimulate their interest in unraveling the rich and ancient heritage of the people of South India in Arts, Letters and Political and Social administration.
