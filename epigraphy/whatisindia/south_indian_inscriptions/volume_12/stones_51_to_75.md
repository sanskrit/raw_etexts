**Pallva Inscriptions**

**Nos.51 to 75**

**No. 51.**

**(A. R. No. 349 of 1911).**

**Kalattur, Chingleput Taluk and District.**

**On a slab built into the floor of the Mukha-mandapa in the Mukudumisvara temple.**

This inscription is worn out in the middle and it is dated in the **14^(th) year** of **Nandivarmma-\[Maharaja\]**. It seems to assign a third share of the income from the local lake to Paramesvara, by the assembly (Perumakkal) of Kalattur in Kalattur-Kottam.

**No. 52.**

**(A. R. No. 49 of 1905).**

**Dalavanur, Gingee Taluk South Arcot District.**

**On a pillar at the entrance into the rock-cut cave.**

This is a damaged record of Vajaya-Nandivikramavarman dated in his 15th year. It seems to register some agreement given by a temple servant residing at Venbedu to a certain Modan, who had made an endowment of one kalanju of gold. Venbedu may be identified with the village of the same name in the Chingleput taluk.

**No. 53.**

**(A. R. No. 352 of 1908).**

**Mangadu, Sriperumbudur Taluk, Chingleput District.**

**On a slab built into the floor of the central shrine in the Vallisvara temple.**

This damaged inscription is dated in the 17th year of Vijaya-Nandivikramavarman and it mentions the Seliya-Vaniyar of Kunrattur, who evidently made provision for offerings to the god on Tiruvadirai and amavasya days, through the sabha of Tiruvellikiludaiya (Mahadeva). This is the earliest inscription in the temple and it probably belongs to Nandivarman III. In a later inscription of the place the god is called Tiruvellikilmeya-Nayanar[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/stones_51_to_75.html#_ftn1). Chutavana mentioned in the Udayendiram plates of Nandivarman is probably identical with Mangadu[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/stones_51_to_75.html#_ftn1).

**No. 54.**

**(A. R. No. 8 of 1934-35).**

**Padur, Chingleput Taluk and District.**

**On a slab set up in the street called â€˜Mettutteruvuâ€™.**

The beginning of this inscription is lost, but from palaeography and the letters Nan traceable in the first line, it may be assigned to Nandivarman III. It is dated in the 18th year and registers the gift of 96 sheep by the shepherds (kottaanradis) of Amur-kottam for burning a perpetual lamp before the god Peruma\[na\*\]digal â€˜who was pleasedâ€™ to stand at Vilupperundaya-Visnugriham in Paduvur.

**No. 55.**

**(A. R. No. 27 of 1930-31).**

**Tirukkodikkaval, Kumbakonam Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On the south wall of the central shrine in the Tirukkodisvara temple.**

This inscription of the 19th year of Nandippottaraiyar begins by stating that it is a copy of an old stone record found in the temple. A later record in the same place mentions that Sembiyan-Madeviyar, the mother of the Chola king Uttama-Chola, repaired the temple at Tirukkodikka and that she then ordered the re-engraving of the old inscriptions found on the walls before renovation. The Chola queen, by this policy, has preserved for posterity as many as 26 inscriptions in this temple, which would otherwise have been irretrievably lost.

The present inscription is a palimpsest and it registers a gift of 100 kalam of paddy by Alisiriyan for maintaining a sacred lamp in the temple of Sirunangai-Isvaragaram at Tirukkodika. The priests of the temple agreed to maintain the lamp.

**No. 56.**

**(A. R. No. 144 of 1928-29).**

**Sennvayakkal, Lalgudi Taluk, Trichinopoly District.**

**On a hero-stone near the ruined Gopura of the Siva temple.**

This record is engraved on a hero-stone bearing the figure of a Brahman being pierced by an arrow near the neck. It is dated in the 21st year of Nandippottaraiyar â€˜who obtained the kingdom after defeating (his enemies at) Tellaruâ€™. The inscription is damaged and it refers to a certain Mavali (i.e., a Bana chieftain) and to a raid causing the destruction of a matha, in saving which a Brahman hero named Sattimurrattevan met with his death. The record mentions the temple of Arindigai-Isvaram built at Parantakapuram, which must have been respectively named after the Chola kings Parantakapuram, which must have been respectively named after the Chola kings Arinjaya and his father Parantaka I who flourished a century later.  
From palaeography also the record may be assigned to the 10th century A.D. It therefore appears to be a later copy of the original record. The  
mention of a Bana chief outside the Bana territory is noteworthy.
