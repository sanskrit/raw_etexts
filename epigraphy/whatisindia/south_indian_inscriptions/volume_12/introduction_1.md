**PALLAVA INSCRIPTIONS**

**INTRODUCTION**

By far the most important among the later chiefs claiming Pallava descent are the Kadava rulers **Kopperunjingadeva I** and **Kopperunjingadeva II.** They have left a large number of inscriptions mostly in the North and South Arcot districts and in the Chingleput district and these are included in Section II of the present volume. Though the epithet â€˜Kadavaâ€™ is not found among the several *birudas* assumed by Mahendravarman I, Narasimhavarman I and Narasimhavarman II, this epithet along with *Tondaiyar* and *Kaduvetti*, is invariably used in Tamil literature to denote the Pallavas. The relationship of the Kadavas to the main line is revealed by an inscription in the Vaikuntha-Perumal temple at Conjeeveram[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/introduction_1.html#_ftn1) where the kings of the collateral line of the Pallavas who were descended from Bhimavarman, the brother of Simhavishnu, are called the â€˜Kadavasâ€™. The Pallava king Hirnyavarman is stated to have belonged to â€˜Kadava-kulaâ€™[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/introduction_1.html#_ftn2) and Nandivarman Pallavamalla is praised as â€˜one who was born to raise the prestige of the Kadava familyâ€™.[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/introduction_1.html#_ftn3)

Besides the term *Kadava,* the surname *Kaduvetti*[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/introduction_1.html#_ftn4) is also used to denote the Pallavas. A record from Nagar[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/introduction_1.html#_ftn5) in the Mysore State employs the term *Kaduvetti* as a synonym for all the Pallava kings of Kanchi. The earliest reference to the *Kaduvetti* is to be found in the Siragunda stone record[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/introduction_1.html#_ftn6) of about 480 A.D. The Kaduvettis are largely mentioned in the inscriptions of the Telugu and Kanarese districts, but their connection with the Kadavas of the Tamil country is not yet well established.

Kopperunjingadeva I is called Kadavakula-chudamani (No. 120), Kathakavamsamauktikamani (No. 126), Pennainad-udaiyan (No. 125), Avaniyalappirandan (No. 124), Alagiya Siyan (No. 128), etc. He claims to belong to **Kudal** in Tirumunaippadi, which may be identified with the present Cuddalore (Kudalur) the head quarters of the South Arcot district.[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/introduction_1.html#_ftn7)

A certain **Jiya-Mahipati** is mentioned as the father of Kopperunjinga in No. 247. The term *Jiya* corresponds to the Tamil *Siyan* meaning â€˜a lionâ€™ (*simha* ; pkt. *siha*) and the name â€˜Alagiyasiyanâ€™ should therefore be taken as referring to Jiya-Mahipati himself. As this **Alagiyasiyan** is also known as Kopperunjinga in No. 128, [\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/introduction_1.html#_ftn8) both the father and the son should have borne the same name (Kopperunjinga). The initial date of a Kopperunjinga is fixed at A.D. 1243 from an inscription at Conjeeveram [\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/introduction_1.html#_ftn9) and his latest regnal year is the 36^(th) corresponding to A.D. 1279.

I have elsewhere identified **Manavalapperumal** who figures as a subordinate of Kulottunga-Chola III in A.D. 1191 and 1195[\[10\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/introduction_1.html#_ftn10) with Kopperunjinga.[\[11\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/introduction_1.html#_ftn11) As the interval between A.D. 1191 and 1279 is an unusually long period for the rule of a single chief, we have necessarily to presume the existence of two chiefs[\[12\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/introduction_1.html#_ftn12) of the same name. Three stone records, one found at Villiyanur[\[13\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/introduction_1.html#_ftn13) in French India, the second at Tiruvennainallur (No. 170) and the third at Chidambaram (No. 215) settle the question almost conclusively.

The Villiyanur record is dated in the 6^(th) year of Avaniyalappirandar Kopperunjingadeva and refers to the audit of temple account for the period commencing from the 37^(th) year of Tribhuvanaviradeva and ending with the 11^(th) year[\[14\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/introduction_1.html#_ftn14) of **Alagiyasiyar** (Jiya-Mahipati) Koppeunjingadeva. This inscription dated in the 6^(th) year of Kopperunjingadeva, by referring to the 11^(th) year of Alagiya Siyar Kopperunjingadeva would show that there was an earlier chief of the name Kopperunjinga. The inscription from Tiruvennainallur[\[15\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/introduction_1.html#_ftn15) records the re-engraving in the 11^(th) year of Avaniyalappiranda Kopperunjingadeva, of two inscriptions, one belonging to the reign of Rajaraja II and the other to the 35^(th) year of Tribhuvanaviradeva or Kulottunga-Chola III (A.D. 1213), in the latter of which Alagiya Pallavan Kopperunjingadeva is mentioned, thus indicating the rule of two distinct chiefs of the name.

A more definite evidence is supplied in No. 215 from Chidambaram.[\[16\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/introduction_1.html#_ftn16) This inscription is dated in the 19^(th) year of Kopperunjingadeva and refers to a flower garden called â€˜Sokkachchiyan-kamugu-tirunandavanamâ€™ formed at Bhupalasundara-solanallur. Towards the end of this inscription it is stated that the officer Solakon directed the authorities of the Chidambaram temple to incise this record on the same wall where the original gift of this garden was engraved in the 15^(th) year of **PERIYADEVAR**[\[17\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/introduction_1.html#_ftn17) which is a respectful title applied in inscriptions *only* to a previous monarch by a ruling king or chief. Fortunately this record of the 15^(th) year is found on the very same wall and mentions the same garden â€˜Sokkachchiyan-Kamugu-Tirunandavanamâ€™ and what is more important, the record itself belongs to Sakalbhuvana-chakravartin Kopperunjinga who can be no other than the Periyadevar mentioned in the other record. Further, this â€˜Sokkachchiyan-kamugu-tirunandavanamâ€™ which is definitely known to have been formed in the 15^(th) year of Periyadevar is again referred to in a record[\[18\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/introduction_1.html#_ftn18) of the 3^(rd) year of Kopperunjinga who must be identified with the younger chief. Since both the chiefs are thus known to have borne the same name, their records have to be distinguished from each other only with the help of internal evidence. The astronomical details cited in their inscriptions and the name Alagiyasiyan invariably borne by the elder chief are also helpful in this direction.

About the beginning of the 13^(th) century A.D. the Chola empire became so weak that it had to seek foreign aid to maintain its power. Thus we find the Hoysala king Vira-Ballala II[\[19\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/introduction_1.html#_ftn19) Vira-Naasimha and Somesvara, the Kakatiya Ganapati, the Telugu chief Tikka and later, the Pandya ruler Jatavarman Sundar-Pandya, each styling himself â€˜the Establisher of the Chola kingdomâ€™. Kopperunjinga I who was related to the Chola King by ties o marriage and was an officer under Kulottunga-Chola III till about A.D. 1213[\[20\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/introduction_1.html#_ftn20) was not slow to take advantage of the situation. He strengthened his position and garrisoned **Sendamangalam**[\[21\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/introduction_1.html#_ftn21) in the present Tirukkoyilur taluk of the South Arcot district, which was thus converted into a military stronghold.[\[22\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/introduction_1.html#_ftn22) His ambition to rise to power first brought him into conflict with the Yadava chief Vira-Narasingadeva[\[23\]](inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/introduction_1.html#_ftn23), another subordinate of the Chola king Rajaraja III, with whom he fought a battle at **Uratti** in A.D. 1222-23. Closely following upon this fight he must have had another engagement with the Hoysala king Vira-Narasimha in A.D. 1224,[\[24\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/introduction_1.html#_ftn24) which evidently made the latter assume the title â€˜Establisher of the Chola countryâ€™ and â€˜the destroyer o the demon Kadavarayaâ€™.[\[25\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/introduction_1.html#_ftn25) Prior to this engagement the Hoysala king claims to have overrun the land  
defeating the Magada chief and the Pandya King and even to have planted a pillar of victory at Ramesvaram by Saka 1145 (A.D. 1223-24).  
[\[26\]](inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/introduction_1.html#_ftn26) The devastation of the Kadava territory is explicitly referred to in a record from Tiruvadatturai[\[27\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/introduction_1.html#_ftn27) in the South Arcot district which may be  
dated in A.D. 1226 and in an unpublished record of Hoysala Somesvara, dated in the cyclic year Durmukhi (*i.e.,*) A.D. 1236-37.[\[28\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/introduction_1.html#_ftn28)
