This damaged inscription registers the kadaiyidu granted by the officer (mudaliyar) Iladattaraiyar under the following circumstances: Owing to some offence of . . . . . . . . . . Brahmarayan, his lands measuring 34 ma in extent were ordered to be sold in the 15th year and 295th day of the rule of the chief.

On the representation of the trustees of the temple that the planting of boundary stones and the engraving of this transaction on temple walls had not yet been carried out, Iladattaraiyar now issued a kadaiyidu for completing the procedure.

This is a memorandum issued to Chinattaraiyan who was in charge of Vilinallur in Sendamangalapparru, evidently in the time of Kopperunjingadeva. It states that the kaniyalar planted areca-palms and betel creepers from the 26th year of the chief on lands in Vilinallur watered by the spring-channel which irrigated the village Ponmeyndasolamangalam, belonging to the god Atkondadeva at Tiruvennainallur. Objection having been raised to the use of this channel in the village Vilinallur, facilities were, on representation, provided for raising new groves on lands with wells and also for exchanging lands which ere assessed at a lower rate. The document is attested by kopperunjinga and Tondaiman, who also figure as signatories in a record of Sakalabhuvanachakravartti Avanialappirandan Kopperunjingadeva, dated in the 18th year[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/stones_251_to_260.html#_ftn1).
