**Pallva Inscriptions**

**Nos.201 to 225**

**No. 201.**

**(A. R. No. 307 of 1913).**

**Chidambaram, Chidambaram Taluk, South Arcot District.**

**On the north wall of the third prakara of the Nataraja temple.**

This record of the **17^(th) year** refers to the gift of some land in Vadasemangaam in Tiruvindalur-nadu, a subdivision of Rajadhiraja-valanadu which Tittikka-Aduvar of Kudal purchased from Tiruchchirrambala-Muvendavelar of Karikudi for providing additional offerings during the five extra *sandis* to the god Dakshinamurti in the temple of Mulasthanam-Udaiyar at Chidambaram for which provision had been made in another record from the same place (No. 152 above dated in the 7^(th) year of the chief).

The inscription was ordered to be engraved on the wall called â€˜Vikramasolan-tirumaligaiâ€™ by the officer **Solakon.**

**No. 202.**

**(A. R. No. 104 of 1921).**

**Melpadi, Chittor Taluk and District.**

**On the south wall of the mandapa (right of entrance)**

**In front of the central shrine in the Somanathesvara temple.**

This inscription of the 17th year registers a remission of a number of specified taxes on the village Marudampakkam for conducting a festival to the god Cholendra singamudaiya-Nayanar by Amarabharanar alias Siyagangan, who calls himself â€˜Lord of Kuvalalapuraâ€™, â€˜descendant of the Ganga familyâ€™ and â€˜lord of the Kaveri and Nandigiriâ€™. This chief appears to have been a subordinate of Kopperunjingadeva and was probably identical with Amarabharanan Siyagana the patron of Pavanandi (Bhavanandi), the author of the Tamil Grammar Nannul, who figures in records of Kulottunga-Chola III, dated in the 27th and 34th years[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/stones_201_to_225.html#_ftn1); but it has to be mentioned that the interval between the latter date and that of the present epigraph is nearly 48 years, unless we assign the present inscription of Kopperunjinga I. Siyaganga was the son of Cholendrasimha and was also known as Siraimitta-perumal[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/stones_201_to_225.html#_ftn2) and Uttamachola-Ganga[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/stones_201_to_225.html#_ftn3).

From an inscription at Melpadi itself we know that the ancient name of the Somanathesvara temple was Cholendrasimhesvaram[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/stones_201_to_225.html#_ftn4) and that it was constructed by Rajaraja I in the city of Vira-Rajasrayapuram, newly founded by him after canceling the old surname of Merpadi viz. Viranarayanapuram[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/stones_201_to_225.html#_ftn5).

The village Marudabakkam may be identified with the village of the same name in the Walajapet taluk of the North Arcot district.

**No. 203.**

**(A. R. No. 320 of 1921).**

**Tirukkoyilur, Tirukkoyilur Taluk, South Arcot District.**

**On the north wall of the second prakara in the Trivikrama-Perumal temple.**

This inscription of the 17th year records a gift of 2,800 kasu by Sanakiyandal, wife of Kausikan Perumal of Nenmali alias Miladamahadevich-chaturvedimangalam â€˜on the southern bank of the Pennaiâ€™ in Kurukkaik-kurram, a subdivision of Miladu alias Jananatha-valanadu, for providing from the interest thereon, offerings on the Uttarayana festival day every year to the god Tiruvidakkali-Nayanar at Tirukkovalur.

The date of the inscription according to the details given is A.D. 1259, December 26, Friday.

The village Nenmali mentioned in the record is evidently the same as the modern Nemali in the Tirukkoyilur taluk.

**No. 204.**

**(A. R. No. 196 of 1930).**

**Kunnattur, Sriperumbudur Taluk, Chingleput District.**

**On the west wall of the central shrine in the Tirunagesvara temple.**

In this record dated in the 17th year, it is stated that the assembly in charge of the central shrine in the temple of Tirunagisvaramudaiya-Nayanar at Kunrattur in Puliyur-kottam alias Kulottungasola-valanadu, a subdivision of Jayangondasola-mandalam, received 3 palankasu from Piraiyanivanudalar, the daughter of Ponnalvar, a servant attached to the temple and agreed to burn a twilight lamp before the imae of dakshinamurti set up by her in the temple. It may be pointed out here that in this inscription no distinction is made between the territorial divisions â€˜kottamâ€™ and â€˜valanaduâ€™.

**No. 205.**

**(A. R. No. 314 of 1911).**

**Velachcheri, Saidapet Taluk, Chingleput District.**
