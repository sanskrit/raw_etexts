**Tirttanagari, Cuddalore Taluk, South Arcot District.**

This is a verse inscription of **Atkoli Kadavarkon, the chief of Kudal,** remitting the taxes *perum-padikaval* and *vetti* for providing offerings to, and maintaining a perpetual lamp in the temple of, and god Polittinaimanagar (i.e.,) Tirttanagari.

This inscription consisting of 11 verses in Tamil and praising the family of Kadava chiefs, was engraved under orders of Arasanarayanan Alappirandan Virasekharan alias Kadavarayan on the â€˜Gandaradittan-vasalâ€™ in the Vriddhagirisvara temple at Vriddhachalam. The verses themselves do not give any historical information, but the prose passages prefixed to some of them give the following genealogy for the Kadava chiefs.

Alappirandan Virasekharan alias

 
Kadavarayan, â€˜who destroyed kudal

 in S 1108 (= A.D. 1186).â€™

The last-mentioned chief viz., Alappirandan Virasekharan *alias* Kadavarayan is also stated to have proceeded due west of the â€˜Gandaradittan-vasalâ€™ in the Saka 1106 (A.D. 1184), **destroyed Kudal belonging to Karkataka-Marayan and the country of Adiyaman and planted there his flag with the figure of Hanuman on it.** From the context we have to take â€˜Gandaradittan-vasalâ€™ as the *gopura* where this inscription is found. The Kudal mentioned above may be identified with the village Tirttamalai in the Salem District (A.R. No. 660 of 1905).

A copy of the present inscription is also found in the *gopura* of the Kripapurisvara temple at Tiruvennainallur (No. 264 below).

**No. 264.**

**(A. R. No. 463 of 1921).**

**Tiruvennainallur, Tirukkoyilur Taluk, South Arcot District.**

**On the inner wall of the gopura, left of entrance, in the Kripapurisvara temple.**

This damaged inscription is identical with the previous record found at Vriddhachalam.

**No. 265.**

**(A. R. No. 49 of 1909).**

**Tirukkadaiyur, Mayavaram taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On the third gopura of the Amritaghatesvara temple, right of entrance.**

This inscription consists of three verses in Tamil in praise of the Kadava chief who made the ruler of the land bordering the river Kaveri his  
subordinate, by taking  
from him the tiger banner.
