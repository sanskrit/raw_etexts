**PALLAVA INSCRIPTIONS**

**INTRODUCTION**

The present volume comprises 265 inscriptions of the Pallava dynasty copied by the Epigraphical Department from 1904 to 1935. As the records secured prior to 1904 are published in the *Epigraphia India* and the *South Indian Inscriptions*, the whole material pertaining to this dynasty collected by the Department may now be said to be completely available to scholars. In the preparation of this volume, all the transcripts were carefully checked with their estampages, fresh ones prepared where the old were defective and the originals themselves were examined on the spot in several cases so as to ensure accuracy in the readings of the texts. In this task, I received constant encouragement and guidance from Rao Bahadur C. R. Krishnamacharlu, Government Epigraphist for India, who, besides placing all the materials concerned at my disposal, assisted me in checking the proof in its several stages and examining *in situ* some of the more important records. I am also indebted to my colleague Mr. G. V. Srinivasa Rao for valuable suggestions offered by him while reading through the proofs with me and for revising the introduction.

This volume is divided, for the sake of convenience, into two sections, the first comprising the inscriptions of the Pallavas up to the 9^(th) century A.D. and the second, those of two prominent chiefs of the 13^(th) century A.D. who claim to belong to this dynasty.

Though Pallava history has attracted and engaged the attention of scholars for over quarter of a century, there are still many problems awaiting solution. This is especially the case with the first period of Pallava history, viz., the period of copper-plate charters ranging from the middle of the 3^(rd) to the end of the 6^(th) century A.D. The sources for the history of this period being limited, very little is known about its rulers beyond their names. The genealogy of these Pallava sovereigns and the actual duration of their reigns are still unsettled. Whether all the members mentioned in the charters actually ruled as kings is itself doubtful. We, however, get a clearer view of the dynasty during the second period, i.e., the period of stone records extending from the 7^(th) to the 9^(th) century A.D., as the epigraphs are distributed over a wide region with the advantage of some sidelights being thrown from the records of other dynasties.

To the pioneer scholars like Dr. Hultzsch and Rai Bahadur Venkayya, the history of the Pallavas practically stopped with Nandivarman II Pallavamalla, but later researches have helped to trace its continuity till the absorption of the Pallava kingdom by the Cholas in the 9^(th) century A.D. The inscriptions published in this volume contain valuable information for the pursuit of this subject and of the Tamil literature of the period. In the following pages attention is drawn only to the salient features of the reigns of Pallava sovereigns mentioned in these inscriptions.

In one of the explanatory labels appended to the sculptures in the Vaikuntha-Perumal temple at Conjeeveram, Tarandikondaposar[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/introduction.html#_ftn1), pointing to an object, is said to have assured Hiranyavarmma-Maharaja, that it is not â€˜the had of an elephant,â€™[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/introduction.html#_ftn2) but the crown intended for his son. This passage clearly suggests that the crown offered to the Pallava king was shaped like **an elephantâ€™s scalp.** Such a headdress has not so far been met with in Indian sculptures, but strangely enough one with an elephantâ€™s head complete with proboscis and tusks is found worn by the Bactrian ruler Demetrius on his coins, who probably copied it from Alexander the Great. The close resemblance[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/introduction.html#_ftn3) of the crown offered to Nandivarman Pallavamalla on the occasion of his coronation ceremony to that found for the Bactrian king cannot be a mere accident, but seems to be connected intimately with the question of the foreign origin of the Pallavas.

**Simhavishnu or Avanisimha,** the son of Simhavarman and thefather of Mahendravarman I, was the first Pallava monarch who extended his dominions beyond Kanchi in the South. He has not left any stone or copper-plate inscriptions, but is known only through the records of his successors. His territory may be said to have extended as far south as the river Kaveri, which is referred to in a record of Mahendravarman I at Trichinopoly as â€˜the beloved of the Pallavaâ€™.[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/introduction.html#_ftn4) Simhavishnu must have bequeathed this extensive dominion intact to his son and successor as evidenced by the latterâ€™s inscriptions at Trichinopoly (Nos. 8 and 9) and in the Pudukkottai State (Nos. 7 and 7-a). In the Udayendiram plates[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/introduction.html#_ftn5) of Nandivarman II, Simhavishnu is said to have been a devout worshipper of Vishnu, and this is noteworthy in view of the tradition that his son Mahendravarman I who was at first a Jaina an hostile to the worship of the linga[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/introduction.html#_ftn6) was later converted to Saivism[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/introduction.html#_ftn7) through the influence of Saint Appar.

Pallava stone inscriptions date only from the time of **Mahendravarman I**, the originator of rock-cut shrines in South India (No. 12). The majority of his records consist only of his *birudas*, most of which like *Vichitrachitta, Sankiranajati*, *Mattavilasa, Cheththakari* and *Satrumalla* explain his character, tastes and achievements. His connection with the telugu country is indicated by such titles as *Nilvuleneyambu, Pasarambu, Bujjanakanthu, Pisugu, Ventulavittu,* etc., which are given in his inscriptions at Trichinopoly (Nos. 8), Pallavaram (Nos. 13) and Conjeeveram (No. 14). From No. 9 it is known that the upper rock-cut cave at Trichinopoly was called â€˜Lalitankura-Pallavesvara-grihamâ€™ and that it was constructed by a Pallava king Lalitankura, who from the Vallam[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/introduction.html#_ftn8), Pallavaram[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/introduction.html#_ftn9), and Siyamangalam[\[10\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/introduction.html#_ftn10) records may be identified with Mahendravarman I himself. His statue[\[11\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/introduction.html#_ftn11) said to have been placed in this cave is not, however, traceable now.

Among the many rock-cut temples that came into existence in the time of Mahendravarman, the one at Vallam near Chingleput deserves mention. This temple (*devakulam*) is said to have been built by Kandasenan (Skandasena), the son of Vayantappiriarasar (Vasantapriyaraja), who was a vassal of Mahendravarman. The names  
Skandasena and Skandasishya convey the same meaning, as *sena* means â€˜one having a lord or master.â€™
