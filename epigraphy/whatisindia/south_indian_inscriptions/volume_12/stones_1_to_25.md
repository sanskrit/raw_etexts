**Chendalur grant of Kumaravishnu (III): 2nd year.**

This is a Sanskrit copperplate record issued from Kanchipura in the 2nd year of the reign of the Pallava king, Maharaja Kumaravishnu (III) who was the son of Maharaja Buddhavarman, the grandson of Maharaja Kumaravishnu (II) and the great-grandson of Maharaja Skandavarman. The genealogy[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/stones_1_to_25.html#_ftn1) adopted by Rao Bahadur Krishnamacharlu is here followed. The two previous kings of the name Kumaravishnu were the father and son of Skandavarman. The object of the present grant is to record the royal gift of a field in the village Chendalura in Kavachakarabhoga, a subdivision of Kammanka-rashtra, to a Brahmana named Bhavaskandatrata of the Kaundinya-gotra and the Chhandoga-sutra.

**Omgodu grant of Simhavarman : 4^(th) year.**

This is a Sanskrit charter issued by Dharmamaharaja Simhavarman[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/stones_1_to_25.html#_ftn2) of the Bharadvaja-gotra, in his 4th year, in the month of Vaisakha, sukla-paksha, panchami, registering a gift of the village Omgodu in Karmma-rashtra to the scholar Devasarman, a resident of Kundur, who belonged to the Kasyapa-gotra and Chhandoga-sutra. As the same village was the object of grant in the previous charter of Vijaya-Skandavarman[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/stones_1_to_25.html#_ftn3), it is possible that that donee, Golasarman had probably died without issue and thus necessitated its its reconferment on Devasarman of the Kasyapa-gotra, who was probably a member of the collateral branch of the original doneeâ€™s family.

The king is stated to have been the son of Yuva-Maharaja Vishnugopa, grandson of Maharaja Skandavarman and great-grandson of Maharaja Viravarman.

As the characters in which the record is incised are latter, i.e., of about the 7th century A.D., it has been surmised that it is a later copy of an earlier document.

**Vilavatti grant of Simhavarman: 10th year**

This is a copper plate grant of the Pallava king Simhavarman, engraved in archaic characters on five plates strung together by a ring bearing a circular seal with the Pallava emblem of a couchant bull facing the proper left and another figure resembling an anchor above it. The inscription opens with an invocation to Bhagavat (Vishnu), like the Mangalur and Pikira grants of the same king. The genealogy of Simhavarman, son of Yuva-Maharaja Vishnugopa, is traced from Viravarman, the great-grandfahter. The record is dated in the 10th year of the king in the month of Sravana, su., panchami and registers a royal grant of the village Vilavatti in Munda-rashtra with all the taxes due on it, to Vishnusarman of the Gautama-gotra and the Chhandoga-(sutra), for securing long life, strength of arms and victory to the king.
