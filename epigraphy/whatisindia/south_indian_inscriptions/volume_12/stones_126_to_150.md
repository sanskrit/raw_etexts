**Pallva Inscriptions**

**Nos.126 to 150**

**No. 126.**

**(A. R. No. 182 of 1919).**

**Tribhuvani, Pondicherry, French India.**

**On the south wall of the Varadaraja-perumal temple.**

This inscription records in Tamil and Sanskrit the benefactions of the chief **Sakalabhuvanachakravartti Kadavan Avanialappirandan Kopperunjinga.** He is called *Bhupalanodbhava*[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/stones_126_to_150.html#_ftn1) *Kathakavamsa-mauktika-mani* and the conqueror of the Andhra and the Krnata kings. The record states that the chief constructed a temple for Heramba Ganapati on the banks of the tank at Tribhuvanamadevi and that he repaired the embankments, sluices and irrigation channels of the tank, which had breached in several places.

Since the inscription refers to the conquest of the Chola (country), Madhyamamahi (i.e., Nadu-nadu) and Tundiradesa (i.e., Tondai-mandalam) by the chief, he may be identified with Kopperujinga I.

Heramba-Ganapati is generally represented with five elephant heads, 10 arms and as riding on a lion. \[An early sculpture of this deity is found in a rock-cut temple at Tirupparankunram near Madura â€“ Ed.\]

**No. 127.**

**(A. R. No. 178 of 1921).**

**Morijona, near Rangampettai, Gudiyattam Taluk, North Arcot District.**

**On a rock to the south of the village.**

This inscription consists of a single Tamil verse in the Kattalaikkalitturai metre praising Pallavandar alias Virarviran-Kadavarayar, â€˜who conquered Tondai-mandalamâ€™ and who was the son of Kudal-Alappirandar. The same verse is also found as the third verse in the Atti record of Pallavandar alias Kadavarayar (No. 125 above) and thus establishes that both the Atti and Morijona inscriptions belong to the same chief.

**No. 128.**

**(A. R. No. 418 of 1922).**

**Vailur, Wandiwash Taluk, North Arcot District.**

**On a rock above a natural reservoir to the south of the village.**

This inscription consists of 5 Tamil verses addressed to Sakalabhuvanachakravarttin Kopperunjingadeva, surnamed Alagiyasiyan who is said, in the preliminary prose passage, to have defeated the Chola king at Tellaru and to have taken possession of his country after depriving his adversary of all his royal insignia and imprisoning him with his ministers. In the body of the record, Kopperunjingadeva is called Avaninarayana, patron of Tamil, Kadava, Tondaimannavan, Nripatunga, Tribhuvanatti-Rajakkal-Tambiran, Mallaivendan, etc. The verses extol his prowess, fame, victory over the Cholas, Pandyas and the Kannadas and his abiding devotion to the god at Chidambaram.

Tellaru may be identified with the village of the same name in the Wandiwash taluk of the North Arcot district. In one record[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/stones_126_to_150.html#_ftn2), this village is included in Simhaporuda-valanadu (i.e.,) the Valanadu where Simha, probably Kopperunjinga, fought.

Published in Epigraphia Indica, Vol. XXIII, pp. 180-81.

**No. 129.**

**(A. R. No. 229 of 1925).**

**Akkur, Mayavaram Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On the east side of the base of the mandapa in front of the Tanto Risvara temple.**

This inscription states that Kopperunjingadeva who is called Alagiya-Pallavar alias Virapratapar, after imprisoning the Hoysalas and levying tribute from the Pandyas, proceeded to the Chola country along the southern bank of the Kaveri. Proceeding due east, he worshipped at all the sacred shrines, repaired temples and remitted all the taxes on temple lands. While camping during this march at a village, probably Akkur itself, in Jayangondasola-valanadu, he found that the tenants had â€˜migrated as far as the Gangesâ€™ leaving the lands waste. Sympathising with their position, he remitted the arrears of taxes due from them, restored their original holdings and invited the emigrants to settle on their original lands.

The present inscription is probably connected with No. 124 above. Since the defeat of the Hoysalas is also referred to here, this record may be assigned to Kopperunjinga 1. The defeat on the Pandyas claimed in this record could not have taken place after the accession of the powerful Pandya sovereign Jatavarman Sundara-Pandya I in A.D. 1251.

It may be pointed out here that Kopperunjingaâ€™s fortifications built on the north bank of the river Kaveri against his enemies the Hoysalas are referred to in a record from Tiruvenkadu.[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/stones_126_to_150.html#_ftn3)

**No. 130.**

**(A. R. No. 187 of 1932-33).**

**Tirukkalukkunram, Chingleput Taluk and District.**

**In the Gopura (right side) leading to the second prakara of the Bhaktavatsalaesvara temple.**

This is a fragmentary verse inscription identical with the first verse in No. 125 above from Atti in praise of Pallavandar alias Kadavarayar, (the son of) Elisaimogan Alappirandan of Kudal.

KOPPERUNJINGADEVA II.

**No. 131.**

**(A. R. No. 69 of 1918).**

**Vriddhachalam, Vriddhachalam Taluk, South Arcot District.**

**In the second gopura (right of entrance) of the Vriddhagirisvara temple.**

This inscription records a provision made in the 2nd year of Sakalabhuvanachchakravarttigal Kopperunjingadeva for burning a perpetual lamp before the god at Tirumudukunram in Paruvur-kurram, a subdivision of Merka-nadu Irungolappadi-nadu situated in Virudarajabhayankara-valanadu, by Adaippu Tirukkarturai-Udaiyan Kunramuttaraiyan, son of Nerkuppai-Nadalvan Gunamudaiyan, one of the Pallis having the hereditary right of watchman ship in the temple.

The initial date of this chief is fixed in A.D. 1243[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/stones_126_to_150.html#_ftn4) by a record from Conjeeveram[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/stones_126_to_150.html#_ftn5), which equates the Saka year 1182 (A.D. 1260) with his 18th year. The astronomical details given in the record correspond to A.D. 1244, November 13, Sunday. The chief may, therefore, be identified with Kopperunjingadeva II.

**No. 132.**

**(A. R. No. 411 of 1918).**

**Tiruppangur, Shiyali Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On the east wall of the first prakara in Sivalokanathasvamin temple.**

The subjoined record is also dated in the 2nd year of Sakalabhuvanachakravartin Kopperunjingadeva. It registers a gift of land, after purchase, from a certain Aravamudu-Bhattan by Siyarurdevan Adichchadevan of Kuruchchi in Kiliyur-nadu, a subdivision of Pandikulasani-valanadu for the early morning service, sacred bath on Saturdays, unguents, garlands and offerings to the god Sivalokamudaiya-Nayanar at Tiruppungur in Tiruvali-nadu, a subdivision of Rajadhiraja-valanadu.

The astronomical details given in the record correspond to A.D. 1245, February 16, Thursday, with the emendation ba. 4 for ba. 14.

**No. 133.**

**(A. R. No. 409 of 1921).**

**Tiruvadi, Cuddalore Taluk, South Arcot District.**

**On the inner wall of the second gopura (right of entrance) in the Tiruvirattanesvara temple.**

This record is also dated in the 2nd year of the chief. It registers a gift of 32 cows and a bull by Korraman Malaiyan Palandiyarayan of Palaiyur alias Rajendrasolanallur in Palaiyur-nadu, a subdivision of Urrukkattur-kottam, which was a district in Jayangondasola-valanadu, for burning a perpetual lamp in the temple of Tiruvirattanamudaiya-Nayanar at Tiruvadigai.

The village Palaiyur may be identified with Palur in the Chingleput taluk.

**No. 134.**

**(A. R. No. 62 of 1919).**

**Munnur, Tindivanam Taluk, South Arcot District.**

**On the east wall of the mandapa in front of the central shrine in the Adavallesvara temple.**

In this record which is dated in the 3rd year, Alagiyapallavan Virarayan alias Kachchiyarayan confirms the gifts of the devadana villages and lands granted as madappuram, by Aiyyadevar, for worship and repairs, to the temple of Adavalla-Nayanar at Munnur alias Rajanarayana-chaturvedimangalam.

Aiyyadevar mentioned here seems to refer to Kopperunjingaâ€™s father Manavalapperumal, also known as Alagiyapallavan alias Kadavarayan and mentioned in a record from the same village[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/stones_126_to_150.html#_ftn6) dated in the 33rd year of Tribhuvanaviradeva.

Alagiyapallavan Virarayan alias Kachchiyarayan was probably an officer under Kopperunjinga, if not the latterâ€™s brother. His name suggests that he was the son of Alagiyapallavan i.e., Kopperunjingadeva (I).

**No. 135.**

**(A. R. No. 488 of 1921).**

**Tiruvennainallur, Tirukkoyilur Taluk, South Arcot District.**

**On the west wall of the central shrine in the Vaikuntha Perumal temple.**

A grant of 475 kuli of garden land is recorded in this inscription, dated in the 3rd year, by Tiruchchirrambalamudaiyan Sundarapandya-Brahmarayan of Solakulantaka-chaturvedimangalam, a brahmadeya in Paganur-kurram, a subdivision of Pandimandalam, for offerings to the god Vaikunthatt-Emberuman at Tiruvennainallur, a brahmadeya in Tirumunaippadi Tiruvennainallur-nadu in Rajaraja-valanadu, on the 7th day of the festival in the months of Ani (May-June) and Purattadi (August â€“ September).

The village Solakulantaka-chaturvedimangalam is evidently called so after the surname Solantaka[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/stones_126_to_150.html#_ftn7) or Solakulantaka of the early Pandya king Vira-Pandya or Jatavarman Srivallabha (Ep. Rep. For 1910 para. 31). This village may be identified with Tenkarai in Nilakkottai taluk of the Madura district.

The inscription mentions also a grain measure called Adigainayakan-marakkal, probably named after the deity at Tiruvadigai.

The astronomical details cited in the record are not regular.

This inscription, dated in the 3rd year, registers a gift of 1 Â½ ma of land as tirunamattukkani to the god at Tirukkodika in Nallarrur-nadu, a subdivision of Virudarajabhayankara-valanadu by Pakkamudiayan Panchan Udaiyapillai of Ilamangalam in Jayangondasola-mandalam alias Singapura-nadu, after purchasing it from Kautsan Tribhuvanasundaran Dekkanamutti-Bhattan who had the Saivacharya-right in the temple and his younger brother Karpagar alias Tribhuvanasundara-Bhattan.

The details of the date given in the inscription correspond to A.D. 1244, May 17, Tuesday, which, however, did not fall in the 3rd year of the chief. The details are also regular for A.D. 1234, May 9, Tuesday, which would fall in the reign of the elder chief.

Kulattur and Tennavamahadevi may be identified with the villages of the same name in the Villupuram taluk. Korravilli seems to have changed its name and is not easily identifiable.

**No. 143.**

**(A. R. No. 52 of 1922).**

**On the same wall.**

This inscription is engraved in continuation of the previous number and so must be taken as a record of Kopperunjingadeva, incised in the same 4th year.

The village ponmeyndasola-chaturvedimangalam must have been so named after the title of Kulottunga-Chola II.[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_12/stones_126_to_150.html#_ftn9) The inscription purports to be an order of Solakon.
