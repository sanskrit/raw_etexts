**PREFACE**

The earlier volumes of the South Indian Inscriptions Series, which contain the texts of a large number of Tamil, Telugu and Kannada inscriptions have been long out of print and many academic institutions of recent origin keenly feel the absence of these very important volumes in their libraries. It has, therefore, been decided to reprint those volumes and make them available to the world of scholars. Volume XX is the 17^(th) of this Reprint Series and will be followed in quick succession by the subsequent ones.

I acknowledge my thanks to Shri J.C. Gupta, Production Officer,
Archaeological Survey of India, New Delhi for the planning and speed execution of the printing of this volume.

Director (Epigraphy)
