**SAUNDATTI, PARASGAD TALUK, BELAGAUM DISTRICT**

**On a slab set up in the Basti-gudi Krishna II â€“ A.D. 875 â€“ 76**

The inscription is Sanskrit and Kannada language is dated in Saka 797, Manmatha, but is engraved in characters of about the 11th or 12th century A.D. The Saka and the cyclic year correspond to A.D. 875-76.

It records a grant of eighteen nivartanas of land by Mahasamanta Prithvirama, the son Merada, to a Jinendra-bhavana got built by himself. The donee is stated to be the disciple of Indrakirtisvamin who in turn was the disciple of Gunakirti-munisvara. The latter again was the disciple of Mullabhatta of Mailapatirtha and Kareyagana. 

Lines 1 to 4 record a later grant, made by Kanna, of six nivartanas of land in the sivata Mulgunda in Sugandhavartti-12. Lines 18-19 state that the grant made by Prithvirama was renewed by Karttavirya and (his wife) Bhagalambika on the occasion of a solar eclipse.

The donors of all the grants are of the Ratta family, Merada being the first member.
