# **BOMBAY - KARNATAKA INSCRIPTIONS**

# INTRODUCTION

# THE FEUDATORY FAMILIES

**The Kadambas of Hangal**

The well-known feudatory families like the Rattas of Saundatti and the Kadambas of Hangal and Goa are represented by a few inscription included in the Volume Of these, only No. 249 is of some interest. It comes from Banavasi and is dated in the 12^(th) regnal year ofa certain Kadamba-Chakravarti Virama and the cyclic year Durmati, Kartika ba. 5, Monday. The name Virama may be a mistake for Vikrama, the son of Jayasimha or jayavarman II and the grandson of Chatta, the first authentic figure of the Kadamba dynasty of Hangal. If this identification is accepted, then the present inscription will be the only record of this Vikrama discovered so far. The date of the inscription may be equated with Monday, the 25^(th) October. A.D. 1081.

# The chiefs of the Sagara or Manalera family

A family of local chiefs belonging to the Sagara or Manalera lineage figures in some records included in this Volume as feudatories of the Chalukyas of Kalyana.They are described as Sagara-martanda or Manaler-aditya and had the Simha-lanchhana and Kesari-ketu.They were governing the District of Purigere-300 first as mahasamantas and later as Mahamandalesvaras.

Mahasamanta Indrakesiyarasa of this family is mentioned in an inscription (No. 38) of A.D. 1058 from Kuyibal as administering Purigere-300 as a Rashtraku-taka under Somesvara I. From the Prince of Wales Museum inscription of the same king, dated in A.D. 1060, we learn that Indrakesinâ€™s father was Jayakesin (I) and that he had a son called ayakesin (II). The Hulgur inscription of the reign of Jayasimha II supplies the date A.D. 1038 for Jayakesin I. An undated record from Gadag belonging to the time of Vikramaditya VI gives the name of his subordinate of this family as Indrakesin (II), son of Marasingha and grandson of Indrakesin (I). The last mentioned chief, viz., Indrakesin I, is apparently identical with Indrakesin of the Kuyibul inscription.
From the evidence of the Prince of Wales Museum and the Gadag records, it was surmised that Indrakesin I had either two sons called Marasingha and Jayakesin II or that both these persons should be regarded as one and the same person. Now a record (No. 47) of the time of the Bhuvanaikamalladeva or Somesvara II, dated in A.D. 1074, introduces the kingâ€™ feudatory Mahasamanta Jayakesin as the eldest son of Indrakesin and the latterâ€™s wife Chandikabbe. Indrakesin is evidently Indrakesin I mentioned above and so Jayakesin would be-Jayakesin II. From this, it is clear that Jayakesin II was the eldest son of Indrakesin and that Marasingha mentioned in the Gadag record was his (i.e., Jayakesinâ€™s younger brother. It follows that Indrakesin II was the son of Marasingha. The present record reveals the name of the wife of Indrakesin I as Chandikabbe for the first time. Though Jayakesin II is mentioned in the Prince of Wales Museum inscription of A.D. 1060 of the time of his father, he figures as a feudatory of Vikramaditya VI in the Hulgur inscription of A.D. 1077. But the present inscription (No. 47) shows that he was the subordinate of Somesvara II also in A.D. 1074.
The latest date for him is supplied by No. 55 of the time of Vikramaditya VI dated in A.D. 1082. Both Jayakesin II and his nephew Indrakesin II were feudatories of Vikramditya VI.

An inscription (No. 107) belonging to the reign Bhulokamalladeva and dated in A.D. 1138 mentions his subordinate Jayakesin of the Sagara family as the son of Vajradanta and Madaladevi of the Kadamba family.
Vajrandataâ€™s father was named Jayakesin and he had a brother (apparently elder) whose name is lost in the damaged portion of the record. This Jayakesin, i.e., the father of Vajradanta, may be identified with Jayakesin II referred to above, so that Vajrandantaâ€™s son will be Jayakesin III. An earlier date for this Jayakesin III as a subordinate of Bhulokamalladeva is furnished by No. 99 which is dated in Chalukya-Bhulokamalladeva year 53 apparently a mistake for Chalukya Vikrama year 53, corresponding to A.D. 1128. He is also apparently identical with Jayakesin of this family mentioned as a subordinate of Jagadekamalladeva II in No. 117 dated in A.D 1147. Though the name of the family is not mentioned, Jayakesin III. This, therefore, supplies thaw latest date for him known so far. Jayakesin III was the feudatory of three kings, viz., Bhulokamalladeva, Jagadekamalladeva II and Taila III.

In the light of the above discussion, the genealogy of these chiefs may be shown as follows.

# The Silaharas of Bijapur

Besudes the three well-known Silahara families described by Fleet, a few more branches have been recently brought to light by the inscription found in the Bijapur and Belagaum Districts of Mysore State, the former Akkalkot State (now in the Sholapur District of Maharashtra State) and Kurnool District in Andhrapradesh. An inscription from Akkalkot of the time of Chalukya Vikramaditya VI, dated in A.D. 1114, gives 14 generation of a family of the Silharas starting from Pittama and ending with Indarasa II, which would place the former about A.D. 735. A few inscription from Indi and Sindgi Taluks of the Bijapur District included in the present Volume disclose the names of some members of this stock.
They call themselves kopanapuravaradhisvara or Tagaranagaradhisvara and most of them enjoyed the status of Mahamandalesvara under the Chalukyas of Kalyana, the Kalachuryas and the Yadavas. A record (no. 71) from Agarkhed in Indi Taluk belonging to the reign of Vikrmaditya VI and dated in A.D. 1109 mentions his feudatory Mahamandalesvara Govanarasa of the Silhara of Silahara family. The record supplies the following genealogy of this Govanarasa:
