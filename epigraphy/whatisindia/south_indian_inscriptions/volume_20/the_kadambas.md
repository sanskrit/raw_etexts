**(B. K. No. 143 of 1935-36)**

**BANAVASI,SIRSI YALUK, NORTH KANARA DISTRICT**

### **Stone in the jaina Basti**

**Vikrama** (?)â€”**A.D. 1081**

This inscription is dated in the **12^(th) regnal year** of Kadamba Chakravarthi **Vira\[ma\], Durmati,Kartika ba.5, Monday.** This Vira\[ma\] may be a mistake for Vikrama. In that case Vikrama will have to identified with the son of Jayasimha. It may be noted however that no inscription of this Vikrama has as yet been found and it is doubtful if he ruled at all. The details of the date may be equated with **A.D. 1081, October 25,Monday.** It may also be noted that Kirtideva who came after him has for him a date as early as 1068 A.D.

It record the death, by the rite of *samathi,* of Bhogave, the wife of Tippisetti sataya. She is stated to be the lay disciple ofSakalachandra bhattaraka belongings to Desi-gana, pustaka-gachehha, and Kondakunda-anvaya.

**BALAMBID,HANGAL TALUK, DHARWAR DISTRICT**

### **Hero stone set up in the temple of Ramesvara**

Tailapa

The inscription which refers itself to Tailahadeva ruling from **Naraymangal** is dated in the **2^(nd) year of his reign, prajapati, su. Purnima, Monday.**

The name Tailaha suggest that he belonged to the family of the Kadambas of Hangal. But the 2^(nd) year of none of the Tailahas of this family coincided with the cyclic year prajapathi.

It records a grant of land at **Kakere** made by Bammagauda, in honour of his father who died in a raid made by Tailaha on Ballabidu in course of his attack on Huritigi-nadu, the fort of which was in charge of a certain Sovarasa.

### **Broken slab set up Tirumaladeva temple**

**\[Kava\]deva**

  

The date of this inscription is the**1^(st) regnal year of \[Kava\]deva, pingala, Magha su. 5,Monday.** But this date dose not correspondto the 1^(st) year of Kavadeva. **Since the** record is much damaged, it is difficult to make out the exact name of the king.

It records the death, apparently by a rite, of a certain Marakave, a lay disciple of a Jaina ascetic.
