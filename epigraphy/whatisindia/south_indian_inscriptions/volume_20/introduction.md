**BOMBAY - KARNATAKA INSCRIPTIONS**

**INTRODUCTION**

The inscriptions included in this Volume represent all the important ruling dynasties of Karnataka and bring to light quite a few facts not known to students of history and epigraphy so far.An attempt is, made in this introduction to present some of these facts as gathered by a study of some important epigraphs.

While almost all the inscriptions in the Volume are written in the Kannada script and language, a few of them are either in the Kannada script and Sanskrit language or in the Nagari script and Sanskrit or Kannada language. Only one inscription is in the Brahmi script and Prakrit language. There are two records in Nagari script and Marathi language and composite inscription is written in three scripts, *viz.* Kannada, Tamil, and Nagari, while the language are Sanskrit, Kannada, Tamil and Telugu. 

**THE RULING DYNASTIES**

# The Chutus

Among the inscriptions included in this Volume, the earliest is a Prakrit record (No. 1) from Banavasi which is written in Brahmi characters of the third century A.D. It belongs to Vinhukada-Chutukulandanda Satakanni and records a gift of a Naga, a tank and Vihara by the kingâ€™s daughter. While Pandit Bhagawanlal Indraji and Buhler took the name of this daughter as Sivaskandanagasri mentioned in the record, Rapson and Luders thought that this name referred the prince and that the daughterâ€™s name is not mentioned. But in view of the suggested readings given in the text edited below, Sivaskandanagasri could refer only to the name of the kingâ€™s daughter.

#  The Chalukyas of Badami



The first inscription to be noticed under this dynasty is NO. 2, which is written in characters of about eh 7th century A.D. and belongs to the reign of Satyasraya. As the epithet Satyasraya is commonly associated with the Western Chalukya king Pulakesin II, this record may be assigned to his reign.

Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7, all from Lakshmesvar and found in the Jaina temple called Sankha-basti, are in the nature of copper-plate grants.
They are in characters of about the 10th century A.D. and are written in the Sanskrit language. They appear to be later copies of earlier grants.

No. 3 belongs to the reign of Ereyamma Satyasraya, described as the son of Ranaparakrama-Maharaja. Since we know that Ranaparakrama was an epithet of Kirtivarman I and that his son Pulakesin II was commonly associated with the epithet Satyasraya, the ruling king of the record may be identified with the latter. The inscription mentions a certain Durgasakti, apparently a subordinate of the king, as the son of Kundasakti and grandson of Vijayasakti of the Sendraka family. These princes re not known from any other source.[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_20/introduction.html#_ftn1) The Chiplun plates of Pulakesin II mention the Sendrakaprince Senandaraja as his maternal uncle But we do not know whether this Senanda was related to the princess mentioned in the present record and, if so, in what way.

**No. 4** belongs to the reign of Vinayaditya. It may be noted that in giving the genealogy from Pulakesin I downwards, the inscription omits the name Vikramaditya, I (A.D. 655-80), the son and successor of Pulakesin II, and associates some of his attributes to his son and successor Vinayaditya.

**No. 5** and 6 belong to the reign of Vijayaditya while No. 7 belongs to that of Vikaramaditya II. These three grants along with that of Vinayaditya mentioned above (No. 4) were issued from Raktapura. I have shown elsewhere that Raktapura was the Sankritised name of Kisuvolal, *i.e.,* modern Pattadal, and should be identified with that place and not with modern Lakshmesvar as Pathak and Fleet were inclined to do.

**No. 8** from Sidenur belongs to the reign of Vikramaditya. The record may be assigned on palaeographical grounds, to the 8^(th) century A.D. and hence the king mentioned therein may be identified with Vikramaditya II.

**No. 9** from Adur belongs to the reign of Kirtivarman who may be identified with Kirtivarman II as the record has to be assigned to the 8^(th) century A.D. on grounds of paleography. The inscription mentions one Sidarasa as governing Gangi-Pandiyur. This chief probably belonged to an early branch of the Sinda family and is not known from any other source. The record also mentions a certain Madhavattiyarasa, probably a contraction of the name Madhavasatti-arasa. If this is true, then the name suggests that he belonged to the Sendraka family.

# **The Rashtrakutas**

There are eight inscriptions belonging to this dynasty included in this Volume. The earliest of them is

**No. 10** which comes from Sidenur and refers to the reign of Dorapparasa, *i.e.,* Sidenur. Marakka-arasa is known from a few other records as the governor of Banavasi under Dhruva. And from a record from Kachavi, we learn that he had a son named Kattyara from his senior queen Appa-Vineti who is apparently the same as Binaeti-abbe of our inscription. I have elsewhere shown that this Mrakka-arasa is the earliest known governor of Banavasi under the Imperial Rashtrakuta kings.

**No. 11** is undated and may be assigned to about the end of the 8^(th) century A.D. on paleographical grounds. It refers to the reign of Srivallabha, an epithet borne by both Duruva Dhravasha and his son Govinda III, though Fleet was inclined to refer the inscription to the reign of the former.
