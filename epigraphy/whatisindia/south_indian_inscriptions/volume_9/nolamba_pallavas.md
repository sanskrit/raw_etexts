**No. 17.**

(A.R. No. 98 of 1913.)

ON A PILLAR IN A FIELD TO THE EAST OF THE MALLIKARJUNA TEMPLE AT KAMBADURU, KALYANADRUG TALUK, ANANTAPUR DISTRICT

This undated record refers itself to the reign of the **Nolamba-Pallava** king **Vira-Nombadhiraja,** who is stated to have bestowed on **Ajjaparvara Bhidiyereya** a bracelet and called him **Nolambadodda,** at the time of the construction of the **Beddugonde** tank. Another bracelet was bestowed on him by **Srimu**\[**kha**\*\]**rama** who called him **Srimukadodda** and a third bracelet was presented to him by **Singapotrasa, Ponnerarasa** and **Dharmamahadevi** who called him **Ponneradodda.** Nolambadodda and others built a temple for the god Mahadeva. Since the inscription belings palaeographically to the 9^(th) century A.D. the king referred to here was probably **Polalchora-Nombadhiraja I.**

**No. 18.**

(A.R. No. 91 of 1913.)

(A.R. No. 12 of 1927.)

ON A BROKEN PILLAR IN THE COURT-YARD OF THE DODDAPPA (Siva) TEMPLE AT HEMAVATI, SAME TALUK AND DISTRICT

This is damaged and the beginning is lost. It has no date and refers to the \[Nolamba\]-Pallava king **Mayindamma** (Mahendravarman I) and **. . Iambadhiraja** and records the grant of some land to a *basadi* and for the feeding of *tapasvins.* Palaeographically the record may be placed in the 9^(th) century **A.D.**

**No. 20.**

(A.R. No. 306 of 1912.)

ON A SLAB IN A FIELD AT KALAKATTUR, PUNGANUR ZAMINDARI, CHITTOOR DISTRICT

This is not dated; it refers itself to the reign of the Nolamba-Pallava king **Nolambadiyarasa,** who is stated to have been ruling over the **Ganga six-thousand** province and to have marched on **Talekadu.** Under the orders of the **Ganga** king **Permanadi,** a certain Maharaja is said to have attacked **Pulinadu.** In the battle that ensued the village of **Permavi** was burnt by **Kaduvatti** and **Mriduva.** On hearing this, **Virachulamani** (probably the **Bana king**) fought with their army and overthrew it: when there was hue and cry caused by some Nayakas opposing Virachudamani, a certain **Tejamani** was slain. The (Nolamba) king honoured the dead warrior by granting to his family *kalnadu* called â€œElemadalaâ€?. Since the palaeography of the record points to 9^(th) century A.D. as its period the Nolambadivarasa of the inscription may be identical with **Mahendra I.**
