**No. 261.**

(A.R. No. 252 of 1918.)

ON A BROKEN SLAB LYING NEAR THE ISVARA TEMPLE AT GUNDAGATTI, SAME TALUK AND DISTRICT.

This is damaged and not dated. It refers itself to the reign of the Chalukya king **Jagadekamalladeva** and mentions his feudatory, the *Mahamandalesvara* **Vira-Pandyadeva** as ruling over **Nolambavadi thirty-twothousand.** On palaeographic grounds this may be assigned to the reign of Jagadekamalla II.

**No. 262.**

(A.R. No. 8 of 1917.)

ON A STONE SUPPORTING THE BEAM AT THE ENTRANCE INTO THE RANGANATHASVAMI TEMPLE AT KORREVU, MADAKSIRA TALUK, ANTANTAPUR DISTRICT.

This is a little damaged and not dated. It refers itself to the reign of the Chalukya king **Jagadekamalladeva** and mentions his feudatory **bammadeva-Chola-Maharaja** as ruling over **Govindavadi.** The latter is stated to have made a gift of some taxes for perpetual lamp of the god Kammatesvara. On palaeographic grounds this may be relegated to the reign of Jagadekamalla II..

**No. 263.**

(A.R. No. 339 of 1920.)

ON A STONE SET UP IN A FIELD TO THE EAST OF THE VILLAGE UBACHERLA, GOOTY TALUK, SAME DISTRICT.

This is damaged and dated the **4^(th) year of** the Chalukya king **Jagadekamalla \[Du\]rmati,** the other details being effaced. **Singi-\[Nayaka\]** and other Nayakas are stated to have contributed a portion f the toll-revenue for the service of the god Ramesvara in addition to the grant of a village. Paleographically, the record may be assigned to the reign of Jagadekamalla II. In that case it should be read before No. 238.

**No. 264.**

(A.R. No. 316 of 1925.)

ON A SLAB PLANTED BEFORE THE TEMPLE OF HANUMAN AT HALYAM, KUDLIGI TALUK, BELLARY DISTRICT.

This is dated **Saka 1085** (mistake for 1075), **Srimukha, Pushya, amavasye, Somavara, Uttaryana-sankranti, Surya-grahana, Vyatipata.** The date is irregular. In Srikukha, Pushya-amavasya corresponded to **A.d. 1154 January 15 Friday,** not Monday, nor was there a solar eclipse on the day. It was not Uttaryana day, too. The record refers itself to the reing of the Chalukya king **Tribhuvanamalladeva** and gives the genealogy of the dynasty from Talipa to Vikramaditya VI. It records the grant of some land for the service of the god Agastesvara at **Yeleha,** situated to the north of **Kotur,** by the kingâ€™s feudatory **Nachidevarasa of the Kadamba** family, who was ruling over **Kogali five-hundred** and **Koturu twelve** from his capital, **Koturu.** The teacher **Hemarasideva** and Bupajiya are said to have been placed in charge of the lands granted to the same god by **Bommidevarasa** and others. **Soyidevarasa,** son of Bommidefva of Koturu, Chavudisetti, Marisetti and others are also said to have granted lands for the service of the same god. Though the record refers itself to the reign of Vikramaditya VI, its date falls in the reign of Trailokyamalla Taila III. The grant was probably put on stone in the year cited.

**No. 265.**

(A.R. No. 517 of 1915.)

ON A SLAB LYING NEAR THE PETE-BASAPPA TEMPLE AT CHINNATUMBALAM, ADONI TALUK, SAME DISTRICT.

This is damaged and dated **Yuva, Pau\[sha\], su. 5, Somavara, Uttarayana** in the reign of the Chalukya king **Jagadekamalladeva (II),** corresponding, probably, to **A.D. 1155 November 30 Wednesday** (not Monday). The *Mahamandalesvara* **Ahavamalladeva** is stated to have made a gift of land for the service of the god Nakearesvara set up by **Harihar-Andar** of Vasishtha-*gotra.* It is to be noted that though the record refers itself to the reign of Jagadekamall (II) its date falls in the reign of his successor Taila III who began to rule in A.D. 1150. (See No. 267 below).

**No. 266.**

(A.R. No. 37 of 1928.)

ON A SLAB LYING IN FRONT OF THE TEMPLE OF RAMESVARA AT YERRAGUDI, KALYANADRUG TALUK, ANANTAPUR DISTRICT.

This is much damaged and dated **Chalukya-Virama year 80, Dhatri, chaitra, su. 10,** corresponding to **A.D. 1156 April 2.** The rest is lost. The date is not verifiable.
