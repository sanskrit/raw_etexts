**MISCELLANEOUS INSCRIPTIONS IN KANNADA**

**VOLUME IX -** **Part - I**

**GUTTAS**

**No. 389.**

(A. R. No. 215 of 1918.)

ON A BEAM IN THE MALLIKARJUNASVAMI TEMPLE AT KURUVATTI, HARAPPANAHALLI TALUK, BELLARY DISTRICT.

The record is dated **Saka 1104, Plava, Pushya, ba. 2, Su \[kravara\*\]** corresponding to **A.D. 1181, December 25 Friday.** It states that while **Vikramaditya (II)** of the **Gutta-vamsa** was ruling over **Beluhuge seventy** and **Bennevur twelve,** his *Pradhana,* **Susanga-Dannayaka,** with the permission of the *Mahamandalesvara* **Vijaya-pandyarasa,** is said to have made, in the presence of **bacharasa** and the *Mahajanas* of **Kuruvatti,** a grant of 70 *mattars* of land for the service of the god Ahavamallesvara in addition to the *vritti*-land which had been formerly granted by **Vikramaditya,** the elder. **Lokabharana** received the gift.

**No. 390.**

(A.R. No. 215-A of 1918.)

ON THE SAME BEAM.

This much multilated and dated **Saks 1117** and states that **Ballala-Bhupa,** probably the son-in-law of the Gutta chief **Vikramaditya II,** made some gift to **Lokabharana-Munindra** for the service of the god Ahavamallesvara.

**No. 391.**

(A.R. No. 216 of 1918.)

IN THE SAME PLACE.

This is not dated. The five hunrded *svamis* of **Ayyaovle,** who are described as setting the servants of Yama in motion, as roaring with the thuderbold in hand, as giving their enemies to Yama and as generous to the submissive, are said to have gathereed together with the *Nanadesi* merchants and the *Mummuridandas* in **Kuruvatti** and made a gift of one *paga* of the *hejjunka* to **Lokabharana-Munindra** or the service of god Ahavamallesvara. As this Lokabharana is mentioned in No. 389, the present record may also belong to the time of **Viramaditya II.**
