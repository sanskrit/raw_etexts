**No. 317.**

(A. R. No. 38 of 1904.)

ON A SLAB SET UP IN FRONT OF THE KALLESVARA TEMPLE AT KOGALI, HADAGALLI TALUK, BELLARY DISTRICT.

The record is damaged and dated the **4^(th) year** of the Hoysala king **Vira-Narasimhadeva, Svabhanu, Sravana, su. 1, Surya-grahana.** There seems to be some mistake about the date. The details cited work out correctly for **A.D. 1163 July 4,** there having been a solar eclipse on the previous day, *viz.,* July 3 Wednesday. This date fell in the reign of Narasimha I but it was not his fourth year. The next Subhanu *i.e.,* **A.D. 1223** was the 4^(th) year of Narasimha II but the details given are not correct for that year. Some land together with some taxes are stated to have been granted for the service of the god Somanathadeva while **Somana-Dandanayaka** was the *Mahapradhana.* Some land was given also to **Somajiyacharya,** the head of the temple.
Mention is made of the Brahman generals **Hariharadeva** and **Sivakirtideva** and their genealogy is given. Like the *Mummuridandas,* the 96, 000 and the *Setti-Guttas* are described here as *Udagra\[vira\]-vibhavodbhasigal, ie.,* shining with immense warlike spirit. The charity was placed in the charge of the *Setti-Guttas,* the 96, 000, the *Mummuridandas* and all the inhabitants.

The records is dated **Saka 1100, Vilambi, Pausha, \[pan\]chami, Brihaspativara.** In Vilambi neither su 5 nor ba. 5 pf Pausha was a Thursday.
