| No. 363 - 376 Yadavas | [No. 377 - 388 Yadavas](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_9/yadavas_377.html) |

**No. 363.**

(A.R. No. 552 of 1915.)

ON A BROKEN STONE LYING NEAR THE ANJANEYA TEMPLE AT PEDDAKOTTALIKI, ADONI TALUK, BELLARY DISTRICT.

This is very much damaged and date **Saka 1125, Dundubhi, Pushya, su. \[8\], Brihavara.** The date seems to be irregular. Pushya su. 8 in Dundubhi ended on Tuesday = 24^(th) December **A.D. 1202.** On
Thursday the *tithi* was su. 11, which was also the day of Uttarayana-sankranti ( = **A.D. 1202 December 26).** This was probably the day ointended. The inscription refers itself to the reign of the **Yadava** king **Singana.** It records that the kingâ€™s miniter **Basavarasa,** who was ruling over **Sindavadi one-thousand,** made a gift of some plots of land for the service of the god Amritesvara-Gopinatha and Chenna-Somanathadeva and also to several Brahmans (named).

**No. 364.**

(A.R. No. 498 of 1915.)

ON A STONE LYING IN A FIELD NEAR DEVARABETTA, SAME TALUK AND DISTRICT.

This is damaged and dated the **12^(th) year of the reign of the Yadava king Singanadeva, Pramoduta, Magha, su. 2, Adivara.** In Pramoduta, Magha su. 2 fell on Tuesday 9not Sunday) 18^(th) January A.D. 1211. If, however, magha is a mistake for Pausha the date would be equivalent to **A.D. 1210 December 19 Sunday.** It records the gift of the toll-revenue **o**of **Moladakallu by Bhilluva-Nayaka,** who was in charge of the tolls of **Sindavadi one-thousand** in the *manne* of **Jagadala Somaya-Nayaka,** for the service of the god Mallikarjuna.

**No. 367.**

(A.R. No. 520 of 1915.)

ON A SLAB LYING NEAR THE TANK-BUND AT CHINNA-TUMBALAM ADONI TALUK, BELLARY DISTRICT.

This is damaged and dated **Saks 1\[15\]1, Virodhi, Chaitra, su. 10, Budhavara.** â€œIn **A.D. 1229,** Chaitra (lunar) su. 10 fell on Tuesday. But in the solar month of Chittirai or Mesha, su. 10 commenced on **Wednesday, 4^(th) April** = (11 Mesha) at **.06** and ended at **.04** on the following day. The month of Chaitra in the inscription may perhaps have been meant for the solar month Chittirai or Meshaâ€?.
The record mentions **Murari Kesava,** the minister of the Yadava king **jaitugi** as the lord of the *desa* (probably the Sindhuvadi-vishaya). It records that **Anantapriya,** disciple of **Ananta,** who was a disciple of **Jnanapriya,** set up the god Yoga-Narasimhadeva to the north of the tank (made by?) **Joyya** and situated to the west of the village **Tumbula,** which was at a distance of a *yojana* from the river **Tungabhadra** and which was located in the **Sindhuvadi-vishaya.** The *Mahajanas* of the village are stated to have made a gift of some plots of land for the service of the god mentioned.
