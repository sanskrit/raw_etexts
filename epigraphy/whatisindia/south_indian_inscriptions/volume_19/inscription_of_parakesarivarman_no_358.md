**VOLUME XIX - INSCRIPTIONS OF PARAKESARIVARMAN**

**No. 358**

**(A.R. No. 172 of 1929)**

**On the south wall of the same shrine**

The inscription is written in faultry language. This records an agreement given by Kasyapan Chandrasekharan Muvayiratelunuruva-Bhattan a servant of the temple to **Vennambi the aent of Ambalavan Paluvur-Nakkan** mentioned in No. 357 above to the effect that with the help of two assistants he would conduct special worship and offerings to the god on all the days of eclipse, *sankranti* and *Vishnu* (ayanas) during the year, providing therefore the necessary requirements such as rice and ghee for the midday and *ardha-yama* services, and oil for 5 lamps during each of three *sandhis* and 2 during the *sribali* offering, out of the *pidigai-vari* (land?) he had received free of cost. The *gana-pperumakkal* (trustees?) of the temple represented by Tirunilakantha-Kramavitan wee responsible for this service under the supervision of the *Sabha* of the village.

**No. 359**

**(A.R. No. 195 of 1929)**

**Kandaradittam, Udaiyarpalayam Taluk, Tiruchirapalli District**

**On the door-jamb at the northern entrance into the central shrine Chokkanatha temple**

The inscription is partly built in. It records the sale of his portion of right of worship with its) emoluments in land by Urupputtur Porkumara-Kramavittan a member of the *alunganam* of Venganagar a *brahmadeya* in Purangarambainadu, to **Sembar Arulan Uttamanidhi** *alias* **Uttamasola-Muvendavelan of KolliKurumbu** in Emapper-kurram on the southern bank of the river, who is stated to have **constructed the temple of Sivalokatt-Mahadeva** at Gandaraditta-chaturvedimanalam on the northern bank, and who now made over the share purchased by him to the temple (for conferment to a proper appointee?). The seller refers to the purchase of one share by **Brahmadarajan Chakrapani** from **Vasudevan Setti** as recorded in No. 335 above.

**No. 360**

**(A.R. No. 497 of 1930)**

**Valappurnadu, Namakkal Taluk, Salem District**

**On the south wall of the central shrine, Arappalisvara temple**

This records a gift of 2 *kalanju* of gold left in charge of the *nattar* (assembly) of Kollimalai for burning a lamp on the day of Karttigai every year in the temple of Tiruvarappalli-Udaiyar, by **Kanalai Tadiyar wife of** (the chief) **Animuri-Nadalvar** and the niece of **malaperumal.** This is very probably a record of **Uttama-Chola.**

**No. 361**

**(A.R. No. 161 of 1931)**

**Tiruchchatturai, Tanjavur Taluk, Tanjavur District**

**On the west wall of the central shrine Odanavanesvara temple**

This records a gift of 25 *kalanju* of gold deposited with the *pati padamulattar* of the temple of Tiruchchorrutturai-Mahadeva for burning a perpetual lamp with an of ghee every day, by **Nakkan Araiyaperuman son of Devanar of Karpagadanipuram.**

**No. 362**

**(A.R. No. 319 of 1904)**

**Kudumiyamalai, Pudukkottai State**

**On the west face of the north pillar of the rock-cut shrine, Melaikkoyil temple**

In the *M.E.R.* for 1905, this is stated to be incomplete. But there are 6 lines of writing (damaged) engraved in continuation of No. 322 of 1904 which might form part of this record. Thus combined, the inscription seems to register a sale of land to the temple of Tirumulattanattu-Perumanadigal at Tirunalakkunram in Kunriyur-nadu by the *urar* of the village for 7 *kalanaju* of gold which had been endowed for burning a perpetual lamp in the temple, by a certain **Ayattiya\[deva\] Palla\[varai\]yar.**

**No. 363**

**(A.R. No. 328 of 1904)**

**On the west face of the south pillar of the same shrine**

This records a gift of 7 *kalanju* (*tulippon*) of gold and a lamp-stand for burning a perpetual lamp in the temple of Tirumulattanattu-Perumanadigal at Tirunalakkunram in Kunriyur-nadu by one **Sankan Kunrappolan of Malai-nadu.** This is probably a record of **Parantaka I.**
