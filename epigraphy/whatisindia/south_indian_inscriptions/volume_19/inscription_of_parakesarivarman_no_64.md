**VOLUME XIX - INSCRIPTIONS OF PARAKESARIVARMAN**

**No. 64**

**(A.R. No. 478 of 1922)**

**Arayapuram (near Papanasam), Papanasam Taluk, Tanjavur District**

**On the left side of the entrance into the central shrine, Ramalingasvami temple**

This is engraved in peculiar characters and the meaning is obscure. It purports to be a document (*sadanam*) with a duplicate in copper-plate (?), issued by year. The *nagarattar* and the *padi* assembled together, making a grant of a thousand *kalam* of paddy â€œto this godâ€?.

**No. 65**

**(A.R. No. 242 of 1923)**

**Koyil-Tevarayanpettai near Pandaravadai, same taluk**

**On the north wall of the central shrine, Matsyapurisvara temple**

This is unfinished and stops with the mention of Tiruchcheyalur-Peruma\[l\] in Rajakesari-Chaturvedimangalam a *brahmadeya* on the southern bank.

**No. 66**

**(A.R. No. 252 of 1923)**

This is very probably an inscription of **Parantaka I.** It records an endowment of 4 *ma* of land for the maintenance of a Brahmana versed in the Vedas who was to perform worship to god Tiruchcheyalur-Perumal at Rajakesri-chaturvedimangalam a *brahmadeya* on the southern bank of the river, by one Kari Kadikurichchi, a native of Erangudi in Kilvembai-nadu a subdivision of **Pandi-nadu.** Among the boundaries of the land are mentioned **Solachulamani-vaykkal** and **Kodandaramavayakkal.
Kodandarama** is a well-known surname of **Aditya I** and it is possible he also bore the tile **Solachulamani.**

**No. 67**

**(A.R. No. 92 of 1925)**

**Kilaiyur, Mayuram Taluk, Tanjavur District**

**On a pillar in the central shrine, Vedapurisvara temple**

This inscription belongs to a Vishnu temple dedicated to Tirukkadavudaiya Ninra-Narayana-Perumal, to which a certain Tuppil Chattikumara-Battan residing at Sri Viranarayana-chaturvedimangalam on the north bank is stated to have made a gift of 5 *kalanju* of gold in the third year of the king. This grew to 8 *kalanju* in the 7^(th) year, when the assembly of Tiruvalundur took it over from the temple and agreed to supply for offerings to the god, 2 *nali* of ghee on every *amavasya* day of the month, out of the annual interest theron of 2 *manjadi.*

**No. 68**

**(A.R. No. 107 of 1925)**

**Tiruvaduturai, Mayuram Taluk, Tanjavur District**

**On the north wall of the central shrine, Gomuktisvara temple**

The inscription is not correctly engraved. It is also unfinished. It seems to record a purchase of some land from the *sabha* of Sirupuliyur by the *urar* of Karainalur in Peravur-nadu for gift to god Kavaiyalvar (?).

**No. 69**

**(A.R. No. 139 of 1925)**

**On the east wall of the same shrine**

This records an allotment of 6 *ma* of land to the person singing the *Tiruppadiyami* (hymns), a quarter *sey* (i.e. 5 *ma*) to those supplying water for the sacred bath of the god, and another quarter to the *uvachchar* (of the temple) out of the land purchased at Sirranaichchur by **Karralippichchan** of Tiruvaduturai. This donor figures in a few inscriptions of **Parantaka I,** in one of which dated in his 25^(th) year (M.E.R. No. 126 of 1925) he is stated to have built the temple. This may therefore be assigned to a successor of Prantaka, probably **Uttama-Chola.**

**No. 70**

**(A.R. No. 165 of 1928)**

**Tiruppalanam, Tajavur Taluk, Tanjavur District**

**On the south wall of the central shrine, Apatsahayesvara temple**
