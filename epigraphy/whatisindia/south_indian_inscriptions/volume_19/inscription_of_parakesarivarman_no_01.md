This is an incomplete piece recording a gift of gold for burning a perpetual 2^(nd) regnal lamp in the temple, by **Pirantaka Pallavaraiyan Arinjigal.** The name of the donor suggests that he was probably an officer under **Arinjaya** son of **Parantaka I.**

The donorâ€™s name is lost. **Amaninarayana-chaturvedi-mangalam,** which must have been named **after a title of Parantaka I** (*or* **Pallava Nandivarman III**) included in itself besides Tiruvisalur, the village Tirukkalittattai also. This might be an inscription of **Aditya II Karikala.**

*Achchamar* (spiritual head?). The writing resembles that of No. 254 of 1907 which belongs to Rajaraja I, and consequently the Parakesari of this record may be equate with his son **Rajendra-Chola I.**

**No. 5**

**(A.R. No. 296 of 1908)**

**Tirukkalittattai, Kubhakonam Taluk, Tanjavur District**

**On the west wall of the central shrine, Vedapurisvar temple**

This is possibly an inscription of **Aditya II Krikala** son of Sundara-Chola Parantaka II.

**No. 6**

**(A.R. No. 224 of 1911)**

**Kumbhakonam, Kumbhakonam Taluk, Tanjavur District**

This registers a sale of a quarter (*veli*) of land by the *mulaparishat* of Tirukkudamukkil a *devadana* in Pambur-nadu on the northern bank of the river, to behalf of the temple of Tirukkilkottattu-Perumal) for 25 *kalanju* of gold which had been endowed for a perpetual lamp in the temple by a certain Padaivalluvan Kadan Achchan. This land is said to have been presented to the assembly as **Abhisheka-dakshinai** (evidently by the king) on the occasion of his coronation. As the land endowed by this Kadan Achchan is referred to in a record of **Aditya II** from the same place (A.R. No. 225 of 1911, *S.I.I.* Vol III, No. 204), the present inscription may be assigned to the same king.
