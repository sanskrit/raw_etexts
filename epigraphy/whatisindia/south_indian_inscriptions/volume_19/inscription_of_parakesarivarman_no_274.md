This records a gift of 30 *kalanju* of gold for burning a perpetual lamp in the temple under the name *Kumaramattandam,* by Aliving-Kallarasi *alias* **Sembiyan Buvanigangaraiyan.** The donor has been taken as the **younger brother** of the Western Ganga chief **Gangamarttandan** *alias* **Sembiyan Prithivigangaraiyan** and son of **Rajaditya Mahadeva.** This is an inscription of **Parantaka I.**
