**VOLUME XIX - INSCRIPTIONS OF PARAKESARIVARMAN**

**No. 400**

**(A.R. No. 621 of 1920)**

**Udaiyarkudi near Kattumannarkoyil, Chidambaram Taluk, South Arcot District**

**On detached stones in the mandapa behind the Navagraha images, Anantisvara temple**

Portions of this inscription are lost. It records the purchase of two plots of adjacent lands, one belonging to the *sabha* of Mel-Ilattur and the other to that of Mer-Chenninallur in Vennaiyur-nadu by two merchants, **Tiruvarangadevar** and his brother **Aiyanattevar,** who formed them into a unit called Nindadityanallu after their deceased uncle **Dasanagan Nindan,** and adding thereto another 3 *veli* of land after purchasing the same from the *sabha* of Viranarayana-chaturvedimangalam, thus making an extent of 20 Â½ *veli* and 1 *ma* in all, endowed the whole for the daily feeding of 100 persons including 20 Brahmanas, in the hall built by them in the **temple of Dvarapati-Paramasvami** in the village in memory of the deceased person. The assembly ofViranara, yena-chaturvedimangalam is stated to have received from the donor, 300 *kalanju* of gold as *tiruttu-visam* for reclaiming for cultivation the three *veli* sold by them. This is probably an inscription of **Uttama-Cholaâ€™s** reign.

**No. 401**

**(A.R. No. 20 of 1921)**

**Little Kanchipuram, Kanchipuram Taluk, Chingleput District**

**On the east wall of the mandapa in front of the central shrine, Phanamanisvara temple**

This is much damaged. It seems to record the construction of the *tirumanjanakkundil* tank in the premises of the temple of **Tiruppadamudaiya-Koyil-Mahadeva** by one **. . . .** Kolli-udaiyan son of Sankarappadiyan of Tanjavur. The temple is called **Tiruppadawadam-Udaiyar-Koyil** in other inscriptions of the place.
This is probably a record of Uttama-Chola.

**No. 402**

**(A.R. No. 366 of 1924)**

**Melappaluvur, Udaiyarpalayam Taluk, Tiruchirapalli District**

**On the north wall of thAgastyesvara shrine, Agastyesvara temple**

This records a gift of 4 *ma* of wet land after reclamation in Uragankudi a *devadana* village in Pyogai-nadu for burning a perpetual lamp in the temple of Mahadeva of Avanigandarva-Isvaragriham a *devadana* in Kunrakkurram. This must have been evidently under orders of the **Palavettaraiyar** chief as in the case of a similar gift made in the 13^(th) year of Rajakesarivarman by order of **Pudi Palu-vettaraiyan Kumaran Kandan**

This is a clear inscription of **Uttama-Chola** recording a gift of 96 sheep for a lamp in the temple of Tiruttor\[r\*\]ram-udaiya-Mahadeva at Mannu-Perumpaluvur in Kunrak-kurram by **Palavettariyar-Kandan Maravanar.**

**No. 404**

**(A.R. No. 47 of 1925)**

**Tirukkolambiyur, Mayuram Taluk, Tanjavur District**

**On the north wall of the Gokhuresvara temple**

This records a gift of 7 *ma* and odd of land at Kumaramangalam a hamlet of Peravur by **Aruran Ponnambalattadigal queen ofUttama-Chola** as *tiruchchennadaipuram* to the goddessUma-Bhattrakiyar in the temple of Tirukkolambadevar devoutly called here â€˜the daughterâ€™ of the queen.
The land is stated to have been purchased for the purpose from a lady by name **Kadan Singam** to whom it belonged as *stridhana,* through her son **Mahamatran Gautaman Kesavan Srikanthan of Sattanur** a *brahmadeya* in Tiraimur-nadu on the southern bank, as *mudugan* (guardian or representative), and was made tax-free by the assembly of Peravur in consideration of lump-sum payment of 50 *Ilakkarungasu* by the donor.
