**Kilappaluvur, Udaiyarapalayam Taluk, Tiruchirapalli District**

**On the north wall of the central shrine, Pasupatisvara temple**

This records the sale of **2** *ma* of land to Chandesvara-Bhatara in the temple of Maravanisvara at Siru-Paluvur a *brahmadeya* Kunra-kurram for 8 *kalanju* of fire tested pureâ€™ gold by two brothers **Iravi Vadugan and Iravi-Dattan** of **Tirunallur** a *brahmadeya* in Maraik-kurram. The name of the temple is suggestive of its origin to a **Palavettaraiyar chief Maravan Kandan in the reign of Parantaka I** whose inscription (No. 278 of 1926) is also found here. In early times the transactions of Siva temple were all done in the name of Chandesvara.

**No. 211-A**

**(A.R. No. 219-A of 1926)**

**On the west wall of the same shrine**

This is an unfinished inscription engraved near No. 219 of 1926 (No 237) which mentions two brothers **Varakkiyan Iravi Vadugan** and **Iravi Dattan** and **Siru-Paluvur** a *brahmadeya* in Kunra-kurram.

This records a gift of 12 sheep left in charge of the *sabha* of Siru-Paluvur by **Raman Koviyar wife of Paluvettaraiyar Vikramaditya** for burning a lamp in the temple of **Tiruvalandurai-Mahadeva,** with a *pidi* of ghee supplied every day. This is probably an inscription of **Uttama-Chola.**

**No. 213**

**(A.R. No. 145 of 1928)**

**Tiruppalanam, Tanjavur Taluk, Tanjavur District**

**On the north wall of the central shrine, Apatsahayesvara temple**
