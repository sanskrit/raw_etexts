This is written in very faulty language and is also incomplete. A portion of the record is in slightly different writing and hence possibly it may both be genuine. It states that while the king (Udaiyar) **Uttama-Solar** was staying in his palace **at Kanchipuram, Kampanan Iraman** alias **Uttaamasola-Piridigangaraiyar the chief of Pangala-nadu** in palgunra-kottam made a representation to the former and got the village Odiyampallam in Pudanadippadi in his jurisdictional *nadu* endowed as a *sarvamanya-iraiyili* to the temple of Mahadeva at Tiruppalangolur with the details of the requirements refined for the several services in the temple to be derived out of the lands. It also mentions the necessary irrigational facilities to be made available for these lands. Reference is made to two officers of the king **Ulahan Gandaradittan** *alias* **Minavan-Muvendavelan** and **Paluvur-Nakkan** *alias* **Vikkiramsola-Marayan.**
