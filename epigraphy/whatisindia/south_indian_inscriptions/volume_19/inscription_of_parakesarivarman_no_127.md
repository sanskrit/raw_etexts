**VOLUME XIX - INSCRIPTIONS OF PARAKESARIVARMAN**

**No. 127**

**(A.R. No. 715 of 1909)**

**Alambakkam, Lalgudi Taluk, Tiruchirapalli District**

**On the south wall of the central shrine, Kailasanatha temple**

This registers the sale, free of taxes, of a land held in common by the *sabha* of **Dantivarmamangalam** a *brahmadeya* on the northern bank of the river, to the temple of Amaresvara-Perumal for 16 *kalanju* of gold which had been endowed to the temple for a perpetual lamp by a member for the *alungana* (name lost0 of the *sabha.*

**No. 128**

**(A.R. No. 44 of 1910)**

**Tirukkarugavur (Tirukkalavur), Sorgali Taluk, Tanjavur District**

**On the north wall of the central shrine, Madhuvanesvara temple**

This gives a list of the lands, 3 *veli* in all, which had been endowed from taxes by order of the king (*Udaiyar*). The writing seems to be of the time of **Rajendra-Chola I.**

**No. 129**

**(A.R. No. 45 of 1910)**

This is much damaged. This seems to register the sale of some land belonging to four persons by virtue of their right of worship in the temple of Tirukkarugavur Alvar for 24 days in the month, which they had purchased from certain individuals previously, and which they now disposed of to the temple for 20 *Ilakkasu.*

**No. 130**

**(A.R. No. 46 of 1910)**

**On the same wall**

This records an endowment of 3 veli of land (by the king) at the request of **Singan Kaliyan** *alias* **Uttamasola Muvendavean** of Konmaipakkam with its annual produce of 710 *kalam* of paddy specifically allotted for the various requirements of worship in the temple of Tirukkarugavur-Mahadevar. This appointment was made through the **officers Koyil-Mayilai** *alias* **Madhurantaka-Muvnedavelan of Sirringan** and **Sattan Pasupati** *alias* **Kaliyan Tandesvaran.** The and is said to have adjoined a bigger plot of 40 *veli* endowed to the temple at Tiruvalanjuli, from which it seems to have bee separated as being in excess of the needs of that temple. This is evidently an inscription of **Uttama-Chola.**

**No. 131**

**(A.R. No. 234A of 1911)**

**Kumbhakonam, Kumbhakonam Taluk, Tanjavur District**

**On the north and west walls of the central shrine, Nagesvara temple**

The details of the date given in this inscription viz., 5^(th) year, Ani. \[su.\]5, Mula, Friday correspond to A.D. 975, June 16, .85, but with two corrections: weekday being Wednesday and nakshatra Magha.

This records a sale of land a quarter *veli* in extent made by the *Mulaparudaiperumakkal* of Tirukkudamukkil to Madevan Kandi a servant-woman attached to the **Karralippirattiyar-Velam at Tanjavur** for 20 *kasu* which was endowed by her for the maintenance of a person who was to supply a pot of water from the Kaveri river thrice every day for the sacred bath of the god. **Karralippirattiyar** seems to be the same as the donor figuring n No. 95 above and probably different from her namesake who **was the wife of the Kodumbalur chief Bhuti-Vikramaesari** the subordinate of **Sundara-Chola Parantaka II.**

**No. 132**

**(A.R. No. 243 of 1911)**

**On the west and south walls of the same shrine**

This inscription is damaged. It seems to record the distribution of the sheep which had been presented to the temple of Tirukkilkottattu-Paramasvami at Tirukkudamukkil in Pambur-nadu, among several individuals for the supply of the necessary ghee by them for burning three perpetual lamps in the temple. The writing closely resembles that of No. 7. This is probably assignable to **Uttama-Chola.**
