**VOLUME XIX - INSCRIPTIONS OF PARAKESARIVARMAN**

**No. 295**

**(A.R. No. 193 of 1931)**

**On the same wall**

This records a gift of 96 sheep for burning a perpetual lamp in the temple with the daily supply of an *ulakku* of ghee from two local shepherds, made by **Chedi-Mahadeviyar** wife **of Siddavadattadigal the chief of Maladu,** on the day of a solar eclipse. This is evidently an inscription of **Uttama-Chola.**

**No. 296**

**(A.R. No. 245 of 1931)**

**Tirunarayanapuram, Musiri Taluk, Tiruchirapalli District**

**On the lintel of the Vedanayaki-Tayar shrine, Vedanarayana-Perumal Temple**

This is a fragment of an inscription which should have recorded an exchange the temple (of Vaikunrattu-Ninraruliya-Perumal) at **Mahendramangalam.** On the top of this stone is the concluding portion of another inscription which records a gift of land as a *devadana* to the temple by a private individual.

**No. 297**

**(A.R. No. 690 of 1904)**

**Tirupparkadal, Walajapet Taluk, North Arcot District**

**On the north wall of the central shrine, Kharapurisvara temple**

This is dated on the 120^(th) day which is called *kotta-nal* (day of triumph) in the 12^(th) year of the king, the significance of which is not clear. It records an endowment of 50 *kalanju* of gold of 9Â½ *mari* in fineness, made by **Sembiyan Ilangovelar Pudi (Bhuti) Adittar** to provide for the daily supply of *nail* of rice for offerings and an *ulakku*of oil for burning a perpetual lamp in the temple of Tirukkarapurattu-Perumanadigal at Kavadippakkam *alias* Amaninarayana-chaturvedimangalam in Paduvur Kottam. The *Maha-sabha* of the village which received this amount deputed their **Annual Tank-supervision Committee** and the headman of the Sirrur(?) for the year respectively to make the supply. Other committees of the assembly are also mentioned incidentally, like the *kudumba variyam, Totta-variyam, Kalani-variyam* the *Bhattas* and others. The donor is evidently identical with the **Kodumbalur chief Adityavarman son of Bhuti Vikramakesari. (M.E.R.** for 1908, Part II,). This seems to be assignable to **Parantaka I.**

**No. 298**

**(A.R. No. 628 of 1905)**

**Tiruchchengodu, Tiruchchengodu Taluk, Salem District**

**On the rock to the west of the boulder called the Nagar-gundu, on the way to Ardhanarisvara temple**

This is damaged. It seems to record a gift of 26 *kalanju* of gold by on Uttaman Ganavadi a member of the assembly known as *Sonattu-Prumakkal* Tiruchchengodu for feeding Brahmanas on the hill on some festival days in the year month of Masi.

**No. 299**

**(A.R. No. 637 of 1905)**

**On the rock east of the steps known as Arupadampadi, on the hill in the same village**

This is much damaged. It seems to record some endowment made by one **Ranamuka-Naranan** for feeding Brahmanas (in the temple on the hill) on the day of his natal star Rohini in the Masi month.

**No. 300**

**(A.R. No. 209 of 1907)**

**Tiruvidaimarudur, Kumbhakonam Taluk, Tanjavur District**

**On the north wall of the central shrine, Mahalingasvami temple**

This is damaged. It seems to record an endowment of land (a *veli* and half in extent) by a resident of Tanjavur to the temple of Tiruvidaimurududaiyar, for offering and worship to goddess Pallikkattil-Pirattiyar. The *devakarmis* of the temple the *sabha* of Tiraimur, the *Nagarattar* of Tiruvidai-marudil and the *Srikaryam* (supervisor) are stated to have met in the big *kavanam* (courtyard) of the temple when the gift was made.
