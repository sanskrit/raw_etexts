**VOLUME XIX - INSCRIPTIONS OF PARAKESARIVARMAN**

**INTRODUCTION**

**..... Bhuti Adityaâ€™s** son **Madhurantakan Irukkuvel** *alias* **Achchan (Adityan) Vikrama Kessari** figures in two inscriptions from Kudumiyamalai (Nos. 413 and 414) dated in the 21st year of the king,l wherein he is stated to have endowed a village called Marudangudi for all the requirements of the temple at Tirunalakkunram (Kudumiyanmalai).

No. 436 from the same place dated in the 33^(rd) year of Parakesari (Parantaka) introduces as donor a certain officer by name Mayilai Tidan *alias* Avantiyakova-Pallavaraiyan of Pudukkudi in Urattur-kurram. This person is already familiar to us from a record (*S.I.I.* VIII, No. 694) of the 3^(rd) year of Rajakesarivarman (Gandaraditya) where he is stated to have obtained the permission of **Virasola Ilangovelar** *alias* **Parantakan** Kunjaramallan mentioned above, for bringing a land under cultivation before making a grant of it to the temple.

There seem to have been more than one person bearing the tile Virasola Ilangovel. A record of Parakesariâ€™s 10^(th) year (No. 249) from Uyyakkondan Tirumalai (Tiruchirapalli district) registers a gift of sheep to the temple by one Peranana Viranarayanan *alias* Sembiyan Marayan who is referred to an an officer (*perundanam*) under **Virasola Ilangovelar** of Kodumbalur without mentioning the chiefâ€™s proper name. Taking this Parakesari as referring to Parantaka I we may equate Virasola-Ilangovelar with the chief of that tile or name figuring in a record of the 28^(th) year of the same king from Tiruppalatturai (*S.I.I.* VIII, No. 566) and with **Virasola Ilangovelar Adittan Tiruvorriyauradigal** of another record (Ibid No. 632) from Tiruchendurai dated in the kingâ€™s 23^(rd) year. He was possibly a brother of **Adittan Bhuti** *alias* **Madhurantakan Irukkuve;** already mentioned. ****And it is likely that the latteer had a son also called Virasola-Ilangovel *alias* Orri Madhurantakan (Ibid, No. 611) whose sons again were Parantaka (Ibid No. 676) and Madhurantakan (Ibid, No. 611) whose sons again were Parantak (Ibid No. 676) and Madhurantakan Achchapidaran, the donor mentioned in No. 33 of Volume XIII of the time of Rajaraja I. The relationship of all the members of this dynasty so far mentioned, as surmsed above (and one or two others also) may be expressed in the following provisional genealogical table for easy reference.

6\. **Arinjaya** the son of Parantaka is known to have had a rule of only two years, (the next Parakesari) **Aditya II Karikala** also had a brief reign, and hence the inscriptions of their period are very limited in number. Even of these the records of the latter between the 2^(nd) and 5^(th) years of his reign invariably refer to him with the attribute â€œParakesarivarman who took the head of the Pandya (or Vira-Pandya)â€?, and it is therfore doubtful if any inscriptions of Parakesarivarman without that appelation can be assigned to his reign.

Of about 80 epigraphs included in this volume dated in the 2^(nd) year of Parakesarivarman, only 20 seem to belong to **Arinjaya.** Most of these are records of gifts to temples made by members of different military groups or **regiments called after the surnames or titles** of Parantaka I and his son Rajaditya who predeceased his father, having been killed in battle. These are the Singalantaka-terinda-Kaikkolar (Nos. 3 and 21), the Dantatonga-terinda-Kaikkolar (No. 13), the the Parantaka-terinda-Kaikkolar (No. 17) and the Muttavalperra-Kaikkolar (Nos. 18 and 19).

No. 3 gives the interesting information of the **dedication of a sword** with its hilt made of sandal-wood (*srikhandam*) to the god at Tiruvidaimarudur by a soldier named Mutti Tirunaranan. A similar gift of a sword by one Arikulakesari-Vilupparaiyan is also recorded in another inscription (No. 438 of 1908) engraved on a pillar in the temple at Tiruvilimilai which has been referred to in a previous paragraph in another connection.

Two persons Araiyan Vengadavan and Devadi Vidyaparan who ae said to have belonged to **Muttavalperra-Kaikkolar** regiment figure as donors in Nos. 18 and 19 from Udaiyargudi. The same regiment is mentioned in a later record of the time of Uttama-Chola also from Kanchipuram (No. 365). The name of this body suggests the conferment of some special honour like the presentation of a sword by the king on a company of experienced soldiers for their efficiency or valour.

A prominent person of this reign who figures as donor of land in two inscriptions from Tiruppalanam (Nos. 30 and 31) was **Adittan Viman** of Kumarapadi in Kalatturkottam who is called the chief (*araiyan*) of Andurai. He is believed to have been the father of **Viman Kundavaiyar the queen of Arinjaya.** (M.E.R. 1928, II, 3)

No. 11 from Udaiyargudi records a gift to the temple by Sembiyan Mahadeviyar who is referred to as the queen of Gandaradityadeva â€œwho was pleased to go westâ€? probably signifying his death as a recent event still fresh in the memory of the people. She is also called in the inscription the daughter of Malavaraiyar a chief of Malanadu family which has been mentioned in a previous paragraph.

The authorities of the temple of Tirukkilkottattu-Perumanadigal at Tirukkudamukkil (the present Nagesvarasvami temple at Kumbhakonam) are said to have purchased in the 2^(nd) year of the king (Arinjaya) a quarter *veli* of land from the *Mula-parishat* (assembly) of that place out of the land which had been presented to them as *abhisheka-dakshimai* or coronation present (No. 6). Two inscriptions of Rajakesarivarman (Gandaraditya) from the same place (Vol. XIII, Nos. 44 and 46 also speak of *veli* of land at Arisalur as obtained by the *sabha* as *abhisheka-dakshinai.* It finds mention again in aninscription of the 11^(th) year of Utttama-Chola (No. 95) where it is stated that a portion of this *abhisheka-dakshinai* land was sold to a lady at Tanjavur who endowed it to the temple on behalf (in memory) of her son Kari Kolamban of the Gandaraditta-terinda-Kaikkola regiment.
