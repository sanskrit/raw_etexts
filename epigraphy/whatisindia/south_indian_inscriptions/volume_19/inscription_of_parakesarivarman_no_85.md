**VOLUME XIX - INSCRIPTIONS OF PARAKESARIVARMAN**

**No. 85**

**(A.R. No. 672 of 1905)**

**Tirthamalai, Uttangarai Taluk, Salem District**

**On the rock to the west of the central shrine, Tirthagarisvara temple on the hill**

This is much damaged. It records a gift of gold for burning a perpetual land in the temple of Kudal-Alvar by a queen of **Mummudichchola-Perumal,** whose name cannot be properly made out.
This is evidently as inscription of Rajendra Chola I.

**No. 86**

**(A.R. No. 673 of 1905)**

**On the same rock**

This records a similar gift of gold for burning a lamp in the Kudal-Alvar temple by Aiyyan viramadeviyar of Pungunram (another) queen of **Mummudichchols-Perumal.** It is quite likely that this donor was the same as **Viramadeviyar a** queen of **Rajendra-Chola.**

**No. 87**

**(A.R. No. 689 of 1907)**

**Tiruvisalur, Kumbhakonam Taluk, Tanjavur District**

**On the south wall of the central shrine, Sivayoganathasvami temple**

The inscription is built in at the right end. It records a gift of 180 sheep by a private person (name lost) for burning two perpetual lamps in the temple of \[Tiruvisa\]lur-Perumanadigal at Avaninarayana-chaturvedimangalam a *devadana* and a*brahmadeya* village.

**No. 88**

**(A.R. No. 18 of 1907)**

**On the same wall**

This records a similar gift of 100 sheep for a perpetual lamp in the same temple by **Nakkan Arinjigal** *alias* **Pirantaka-Pallavaraiyan,**
a chief evidently called after **Parantaka I** (Vide. No. 70 above).
The assembly of the village (*perunguri-perumakkal)* agreed to maintain this gift.

**No. 89**

**(A.R. No. 66 of 1907)**

**Tirumalai, Pollur Taluk, North Arcot District**

**On a rock to the left of the painted cave**

This had been published in S.I.I. Vol III, as No. 97. But the reading of lines 4-6 which has now been slightly altered by a re-examination of the record, seems to indicate that the two donors virchevagan Pidaran Buttugan and Virchamanayakan Sandayan Ayiravan were members of **two different regiments** of the king, called respectively **Irumadisola Kannadiga-Kaduttalai** and **Madhurantaka-Karunadaga-Kaduttalai** and recruited from the **Karunataka country,** rather than that they were natives of place called Kaduttalia. These two persons made a gift of gold for the daily offerings to Palliyalvar (Jaina Tirthankara) and for feeding therewith a devotee in the *palla* at **Tirumalai** near **Vaigavur in Pangala-nadu** a sub division of **Palkunra-Kottam.**

**No. 90**

**(A.R. No. 198 of 1907)**

**Tiruvidaimarudur, Kumbhakonam Taluk, Tanjavur District**

**On the north wall of the central shrine, Mahalingasvami temple**

This records the gift of a golden hand-plate weighing 3 Â½ *kalanju* and set with precious stones worth 2 *kasu* and 2 *akkam,* for being worn (on the palm) by the image of Adalvidangadevar (Nataraja) in the temple at Tiruvidaimarudil, made by a merchant of the place by name **Kalari Tolri.**

**No. 91**

**(A.R. No. 199 of 1907)**

**On the same wall**

This inscription has been published in S.I.I Vol. III. This is stated to be a record of all the gifts of gold made in earlier times for lamps to the temple, which were now re-engraved on renovation from stones kept underground. The inscription is however left incomplete after the 4^(th) line. Only one such item finds mention here viz., a gift made by **Kadupattigal Nandippottaraiyar,** obviously (after his surname) **Kumaramarttanda.** The authorities responsible for this re-engraving viz. the assembly of Tiraimur, the *nagarattar* of Tiruvidaimarudil, the temple executives in the **theatre Wall** of the temple. This early reference to the theater in temples in noteworthy.
