**VOLUME XIX - INSCRIPTIONS OF PARAKESARIVARMAN**

**INTRODUCTION**

This volume contains the texts of 471 inscriptions of the Chola kings who simply called themselves by the tile Parakesarivarman. Like the records of Rajakesarivarman published in Volume XIII of this series, these also cover the same period of Chola history from the middle of the 9^(th) century A.D. onwards, and hence the transactions mentioned in them are inter-related to each other. As in the case of the previous publication, the inscriptions here are also arranged in the same order of regnal years of the kings, their assignment to specific kings being done after study of each individual record with reference to its original facsimile for determining its paleography and for ensuring its accuracy. This study was made possible by the kindness of the Government Epigraphist who helped me with all the necessary impressions by promptly sending them in convenient batches for examination as an when they were required.

The kings represented in the previous volume were Aditya I, Gandaraditya. Parantaka II Sundara-Chola, Rajaraja I and the later kings kulottunga I and II, The inscriptions in the present collection are assignable to the kings who intervened between them beginning with Parakesarivarman Vijayalaya, the father of Aditya I and the founder of the revived dynasty of Tanjore. A majority of the inscriptions can be ascribed to Parnatka I and his grandson Uttama-Chola, while a smaller number belong to Arinjaya and Aditya II Karikala, and a few are of the time of Rajendra-Chola and Vikrama-Chola.

The earliest Chola kings of whom we have any definite knowledge are those mentioned in the so-called Sangam literature, who flourished in the fist few centuries of the Christian era. Their provenance was the region mostly watered by the Kaveri, now covered by the Tiruchirappalli and Tanjavur districts, with their capitals at Uraiyur near Tiruchirappalli and Kaveripattinam on the sea-coast. Though there is no connected history of these kings, the materials furnished by the literature throw a good of a few famous rulers like Karikala, Kochchengannan and others, and on their conflicts with kings and chiefs of other dynasties.

When the south of the country was overrun by the mysterious hordes called the Kalabhra period and after Kalabhras, the Cholas along with their neighbours in the north and south, the Pallavas and the Pandyas, lost their territory to the conquerors and sank into insignificance.
These latter occupied the land for about three centuries, but nothing much is known of their rule. They are believed to have been Buddhists and probably helped the spread of their religion in their newly acquired state. In the writings of one Buddhadatta who lived sometime during this period, mention is made of a certain Achyuta-Vikranta of Kalabhra-kula who is referred to as â€œruling the earth.â€? This Buddhist divine describes at length in his works the prosperous cities of Kaveripattanam and Bhutamangalama in Chola-ratha in each of which there is said to have been a great monastery. By about the end of the sixth century A.D. the Kalabhras seems to have been driven out of the Tamil land, and the Pallava and Pandya copper-plate grants speak of

the re-establishment of their power under Simhavishnu and Kadungon respectively. The Cholas were probably too weak to assert their independence, and the powerful Simhavishnu claims to have brought the Chola territory under his rule. With their country thus permanently lost to the Pallavas, the Cholas were confined to a narrow region round Uraiyur and continued of conflicts between the Pallavas and the Pandyas, and between these and other powers like the Chalukyas and Rashtrakutas, and many of these battles were fought in places situated in the former Chola territory now in the occupation of the Pallavas, and later partly of the Pandyas also as testified by the existence of their inscriptions. The area round about Tanjavur was under the sway of a dynasty of chieftains known as the Muttaraiyuar whose inscriptions are found at Sendalai and Niyamam, and who seem to have ruled either independently or as vasslas of the Pallavas. One such chief was Kataka-Muttaraiyan mentioned in theVaikuntha-Perumal temple inscriptions at Kanchipuram as a Pallava subordinate in the reign of Nandivarman II.
No. 18 of the â€œPudukkottai Inscriptionsâ€? refers to a Muttaraiyar chief called Videlvidugu Muttaraiyan as a feudatory under Dantivarman.
Another chief of the same name was a vassal under-Nripatunga (M.E.R. No. 365 of 1904). The Cholas through all these three centuries should have been playing a very minor role in the wars, through frequent mention is made of them in the records of other dynasties, thus recognizing their separate individuality as a power. The Pallava-Pandya strife in the latter half of the 9^(th) century A.D. in which Nripatunga claims a victory over the Pandyas and the counter-effort sometime later by pndya Varaguna, seem to have proved propitious for the rise of the Cholas who were now feeling their strenghth under Vijayalaya. This prince who probably fought on the side of the Pallavas at the time is said to have captured Tanjavur and made it his capital (Tiruvalangadu Plates). The circumstances favouring this adventure might have been the growing weakness of the Pallavas and the defection of Muttaryaiyar chief to the more powerful Pnadya, if not his incapacity to stand against the ambitious attach of Vijayalaya. It is also possible that Vijayala befriended the Pandya king to advance his own interests.

3\. A specific inscription of this Chola king under the name â€œ**Parakesarivarman who took Tanjai*â€?*** has been found engraved on a hero-stone dated in his 3^(rd) year, at Virasolapuram in the South Arcot district (M.E.R. No. 51 of 1936) which is not however included in this volume. Its text is published in the *Ep. Report* for 1936 and it records the death of a certain Karambai Kalitudan Kukkan of Attiyur while rescuning cattle from a raid by one Aniyan. It would thus appear that even as early as his 3^(rd) year Vijayalayaâ€™s rule extended beyond Tanjavur. Two epigraphs of a much later period, one from North Arcot (M.E. R No. 160 of 1915) of the time of VikrmaChola and the other from the Tiruchirappalli district (No. 675 of 1909) dated in the reign of Kulottunga III, both refer to gifts made in accordance with stone records of the time of Vijayalaya.
