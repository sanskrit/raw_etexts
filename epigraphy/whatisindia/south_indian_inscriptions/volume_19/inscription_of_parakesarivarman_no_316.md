**VOLUME XIX - INSCRIPTIONS OF PARAKESARIVARMAN**

**No. 316**

**(A.R. No. 305 of 1904)**

**Tirugokarnam, Pudukkottai State, Tirucirapalli District**

**On the second pillar (from the right) in front of the rock-cut central shrine, Gokarnesvara temple**

This is built in at the end. It seems to record some provision made by a resident of Tirvetpur for the celebration of a festival on the day of asterism Uttiram in Panguni month to god Ganapati in the temple at Sri-Gokarnam in Kavira-nadu.

**No. 317**

**(A.R. No. 443 of 1904)**

**Vedaranyam, Tirutturaipundi Taluk, Tanjavur District**

**On a pillar in the mandapa in front of the central shrine, Vedaranyesvara temple**

The inscription is much damaged. It seems to record and endowment in money deposited with two residents of the village, to provide for rice offering to god Bhuvani-Vitanka (Nataraja) on his return to the temple after procession on the day of Tiruvadirai festival.

**No. 318**

**(A.R. No. 320 of 1906)**

**Tirumalpuram, Walajapet Taluk, North Arcot District**

**On the south wall of the central shrine, ruined Vishnu temple**

This records an endowment of land, 1462Â½ *kuli* in extent, by **Koyil Kannapiratti** wife of the chief **Sattan Kalan Ve\[lan\] \[Adi\]tyan**
*alias* **Minavan Muvendaelan of Pullali,** for the daily expenses of the *ardha-yama* service in the temple of theGoindapadi-Ninraulina-Perumanadigal. This land is stated to have been situated in the *devadana-brahmadeya* village Sirriyarur belonging to the *Sabha* of Nallimanglam and purchased out of the share owned by Vishnuchandra Bhutikramavitan a member of the *ganam,* his brother and their sister-in-law. The mention of the chief makes the inscription assignable to **Uttama-Chola.**

Within the body of the inscription are two panels, one containing in relief the figures of two warriors, and the other the figures of a warrior and a woman.

**No. 319**

**(A.R. No. 321 of 1906)**

**On the same wall**

This may also be a record of **Uttama-Chola.** It states that **Sri Govindapadi Narayanan of Urupputtur** a member of the *alum-ganam* of Avaninarayana-chaturvedimanalam consecrated an image of god **Manavalapermal** (in the temple) and made provision for the mid-day offering to the deity by an endowment of land let in charge of the servants of the *matha* attached to the temple

**No. 320**

This records a gift of 90 sheep for a perpetual lamp with an *ulakku* of ghee every day in the temple of Tirukkarkudi-Paramesvara by **Udaitalai Tirukkarkudi Nangai** wife of **Ulaichchanan Kandan Sattan** a resident of **Nandipanmamangalam.** This might be an inscription of **Uttama-Chola.**
