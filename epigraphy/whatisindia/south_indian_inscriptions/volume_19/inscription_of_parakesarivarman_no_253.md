Above this is a much damaged record with its beginning lost, which seems to record a gift of land made tax-free by the *sabha* of the village.
Reference is made to the enacting of play called **Vaigarai-attam** which is also mentioned in another inscription from Tiruvidaimarudur.

**No. 255**

**(A.R. No. 483 of 1918)**
