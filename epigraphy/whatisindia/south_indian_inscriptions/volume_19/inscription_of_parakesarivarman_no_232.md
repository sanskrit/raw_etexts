**VOLUME XIX - INSCRIPTIONS OF PARAKESARIVARMAN**

**No. 232**

**(A.R. No. 292 of 1917)**

**Kuhur, Kumbhakonam Taluk, Tanjavur District**

**On the south wall of the central shrine Amaravnesvara temple**

This records a gift of 25 *kasu* for burning a perpetual lamp in the temple of Adittavisvaram-Udaiya-Bhattarakar at Kurur in Tirunaraiyur-nadu, by one Astra-Siva who deposited the money with the *tiruvunnaligai-perumakkal* of the temple. The name of the temple suggests its origin to king **Aditya I.** The inscription may be one of **Paranta I or Uttama-Chola.**

**No. 233**

**(A.R. No. 591 of 1920)**

**Udayarkudi near Kattumannarkoyil, Chidambaram Taluk, South Arcot District**

**On the north wall of the central shrine, Anantisvara temple**

This is engraved in faulty script and mentions two persons Villaruvi Karai and another (name lost) probably appointed as watchmen to the temple

**No. 234**

**(A.R. No. 368 of 1921)**

**Tiruvadi, Cuddalore Taluk, South Arcot District**

**On a pillar in the Ardha-mandapa, Tiruvirattanesvara temple**

This is damaged in the middle portion. It seems to record some endowment (in money) by one **Padipperaiyan**for the supply of ghee to the temple of **Tiruvirattanam** at **Adhirajamangalyapuram**, and with it also to six other sacred shrines viz. **Tiruvaranavasi, Tirunagisvaram,, Tiruvagattisvaram, Tiruvagnisvaram, Tiruvidainalal** and **Tiruppalanam,** for the performance of *panchagavga* ceremony and for offerning to the deities on the first day of every month, and (also) for special *sribali* offerings on the days of the Tiruvadirai asterism. The gift was left in charge of the *Nagarattar* who held themselves responsible for conducting the worship

**No. 235**

**(A.R. No. 250 of 1923)**

**Koyil-Tevarayanpettai near Pandaravadi, Papanasam Taluk, Tanjavur District**

This records an endowment of land after purchasing the plots from several persons, made by the **queen-mother of Gandaradittan Madhurantaka Sri Uttama-Chola** for the merit of her son, to the temple of Tiruchchelur-Alvar at Rajakesari-chaturvedimangalam to provide for the sacred bath of the god with 108 pots of water on all days of *sankranti,* for offerings and a pair of clothes for the deity and for the remuneration of the *nambi* (priest) who performed worship in the temple. The names of the villages and channels occurring in the record such as *Naratonga, Srikanttha, Solachulamani* etc. are suggestive of the surnames of the kingâ€™s predecessors.

**No. 236**

**(A.R. No. 260 of 1923)**

**On the south wall of the same shrine**

This records a gift of two silver vessels, a plate and a salver for holding the sacred offerings to the god and also of a fly-whisk with labelled golden handle and a gold cup \[*kolgai*\] by **Tiruvadigal Aiyanadi \[see. Nos. 139 and 189 above\]** who is here called **Sembiyan Vesalippad-Muvendavelan.**

**No. 237**

**(A.R. No. 219 of 1923)**

**Kilappaluvur, Udaiyarpalayam Taluk, Tiruchirapalli District**

**On the west wall of the central shrine, Passupatisvara temple**

This registers an endowment of 2 Â½ *ma* of land for burning a perpetual lamp in the temple of Maravanisavara-grihattu-Mahadevar at Siru-Paluvur with the daily supply of on *ulakku* of ghee, by **Malavar Kongani Senni-Nambiyar a maternal uncle of Adigal Paluvettaraiyar Maravan Kandanar** after purchasing the same from Savandi maran Maran of the village in the name of Chandesvara-Bhatara for 15 *kalanju* of gold.
This is probably an inscription of **Uttama-Chola.**
