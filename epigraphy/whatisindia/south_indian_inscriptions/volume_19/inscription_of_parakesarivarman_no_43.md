**VOLUME XIX - INSCRIPTIONS OF PARAKESARIVARMAN**

**No. 43**

**(A.R. No. 10 of 1907)**

**On the same wall**

This is damaged at the end. It records an endowment of 10 Â½ *kalanju* of gold for a perpetual lamp in the temple of Tiruvisalur Peruman at Amaninarayana chaturvedimangalam, a *devadana* and *brahmadeya* village on the northern bank of the river, by **Rajendrasola-Muvenda\[velar\]** of Milalai-murram, probably an officer of **Rajendra-Chola I.**

**No. 44**

**(A.R. No. 16 of 1907)**

**On the same wall**

This seems to register an endowment of Tiruvisalur-Perumanadigal, of 160 *kuli* of land to the south of Pasi-vaykkal (channel) and north-west of Avaninarayana-chaturvedimangalam, by one Madalan Sendan a resident of the place.

**No. 45**

**(A.R. No. 247 of 1907)**

**Tiruvidaimarudur, Kumbhakonam Taluk, Tanjavur District**

**On the south wall of the central shrine, Mahalingasvami temple**

This records a gift of a silver pot weighing about 144 (*kalanju*) to the temple by a native of **Pandi-**\[**nadu**\].

**No. 46**

**(A.R. No. 4394 of 1908)**

**Tiruvilimilalai, Nannilam Taluk, Tanjavur District**

**On a pillar in the Sundarakuchambal shrine in the Vilinathasvami temple**

This records the gift of a silver dish weighing 240 *kalanju* to hold the daily *sribali* offerings to God Paramesvara-Bhatara of Tiruvilimilalai by **Udaiyar Tantonri. Tanichchevagar,** by which is perhaps meant the king himself as the â€˜devoted servantâ€™ of God Tantonri. Tiruvilimilalai is said to have been a *murruttu-devadana* of (god) Vennattu-Perumanar. This is engraved immediately below No. 438 of 1908 mentioning one Arikulakesari-Vilupparaiyan. This might be assigned to **Arinjaya** instead of to Vijayalaya as is surmised in M.E.R for 1909.

**No. 47**

**(A.R. No. 377 of 1909)**

**Siddhalaingamada, Tirukkoyilur Taluk, South Arcot District**

**On the south wall of the mandapa in front of the central shrine, Vyaghrapadesvara temple**

The inscription is left incomplete. It records an endowment of land at Vilivalam to provide for offerings, etc. and for burning a perpetual lamp in the temple of Tiruppulippagavar at Sirringur a *brahmadeya* in Kurukkai-kurram a subdivision of Miladu. The donorâ€™s name is lost.

**No. 48**

**(A.R. No. 720 of 1909)**

**Alambakkam, Lalgudi Taluk, Tiruchirapalli district**

**On the north wall of the central shrine, Kailasnatha temple**

This records an endowment of land made by the *sabha* of **Dandipanmamangalam** *a brahmadeya* on the northern bank of the river, to provide for the (daily) procession of the god within the *prakara,* in the temple of Amaresvara-Perumal of their village. The inscription seems to be assignable to **Parantaka I.**

**No. 49**

**(A.R. No. 81 of 1910)**

**Tiruvellarai, Lalgudi Taluk, Tiruchirapalli District**

**On the rock in front of the Jambunathasvami temple**

This is possible an inscription of **Paranataka I.** It seems to record a gift of land after purchase at **Nripatunga-mangalam** a *brahmadeya* village, by a private individual for worship and offerings to the god within the main shrine as *unnaligaippuram*in the temple of Tiruvanaikkal-Perumanadigal at Tiruvellarai.
