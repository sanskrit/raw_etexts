This short inscription is engraved on a pillar in the south-east corner of the veranda which surrounds the shrine of the Ujjivanatha temple at Uyyakkondan-Tirumalai, a village 3 miles west of Trichinopoly. It records the gift of a perpetual lamp in the 34^(th) year of the reign of Madirai-konda Ko-Parakesarivarman, *i.e.,* of the Chola king Parantaka I. The donor was Pirantakan-Madevadigalar, a queen of Pirantakan-Kandaradittadevar. The only king with a similar name, of which we known, is Gandaradityavarman, the second son of Parantaka I. As the inscription belongs to the time of Parantaka I. himself, and as it prefixes the word *Pirantakan* to the name of Kandaradittadevar,[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_75_76_pillar_at_uyyakkondan.html#_ftn1) it is evident that Gandaradityavarman, the son of Parantaka I., is actually meant here. The name Parantaka also forms the first-member of the name of the queen of Kandaradittadevar; Pirantakan-Madev-adigalar probably means â€˜the devotee (of the temple) of Mahadeva, (founded by) Parantaka (I.).â€™

The hitherto published inscriptions of Parantaka I. are dated in the 13^(th), 15^(th), 24^(th) and 26^(th) years of his reign. The latest sure date hitherto found is the 40^(th) year in an inscription of the Panchanadesvara temple at Tiruvaiyaru.[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_75_76_pillar_at_uyyakkondan.html#_ftn2)

The large Leyden grant (I. 48 ff.) states that Gandaradityavarman, the second son of Parantaka I., â€œfounded, for the sake (of bliss) in another (world), a large village, (called) by his own name, in the country on the northern bank of Kaveraâ€™s daughter (*i.e.,* the Kaveri river).â€? This village appears to be identical with Gandaraditya-Chaturvedimangalam, which is mentioned in several Tanjore inscriptions[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_75_76_pillar_at_uyyakkondan.html#_ftn3) as belonging to a district on the northern bank (of the Kaveri), and with the modern Kandaradityam in the Udaiyarpalaiyam talluqa. The fifth of the nine Saiva hymns known as *Tiruvisaippa* was composed by Kandaradittan*,* who calls himself â€˜king of the people of Tanjai,â€™ *i.e.,* Tanjore, and must be accordingly identified with the Chola king Gandaradityavarman.[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_75_76_pillar_at_uyyakkondan.html#_ftn4) The carpenter Kandaraditta-Perundachchan in No. 66, paragraph 505, is apparently named after Gandaradityavarman, the granduncle of the then reigning king Rajarajadeva.

According to the subjoined inscription, the ancient name of Uyyakkondan-Tirumalai was Nandipanmamangalam, which suggests that the place may have been founded by one of the Pallava kings named Nandivarman. The temple was called Tirukkarkudi-Paramesvara. This enables us to identify it with Karkudi, a shrine, which is referred to in the *Periyapuranam* as situated in the Chola country to the south of the Kaveri river.

**Translation**

In the thirty-fourth year (of the reign) of Madirai-konda Ko-Parakesarivarman,â€” Pirantakan-Madevadigalar, the daughter of Mara-Perumal (and) queen of Pirantakan-Kandaradittadevar, gave ninety full-grown ewes, which must neither die nor grow old,[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_75_76_pillar_at_uyyakkondan.html#_ftn5) to (the temple of) Tirukkarkudi-Paramesvara at Nandipanmamangalam, a *brahmadeya* on the southern bank (*of the* Kaveri *river*), for supplying, every day as long as the moon and the sun endure, (one) *urakku (stamped with*) a trident,[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_75_76_pillar_at_uyyakkondan.html#_ftn6) in order to feed one sacred perpetual lamp which shall burn day and night. (The charity is placed under) the protection of all *Mahesvaras.*

**No. 76. Udayendiram Plates of Prithivipati II. Hastimalla.**

The subjoined inscription was first made known by the Rev. T. Foulkes in the *Manual of the salem District,* Vol. II, p. 369 ff. It is engraved on one of the five sets of copper-plates, which appear to have been discovered at Udayendiram in A. D. 1850 and are now in the possession of the Dharmakarta of the Saundararaja-Perumal temple at Udayendiram. I owe the opportunity of using the original plates to the courtesy of Mr. F.A. Nicholson, i.c.s..

The copperplates are seven in number. They measure about 8 Â¾ to 8 7/8 by 3 Â¼ inches. The edges of each plate are raised into rims for the protection of the writing, which is in very good preservation. The plates are strung on a copper ring, which had been already cut when Mr. Foulkes examined the plates. The ring is about Â½ inch thick and measures about 5 Â¼ inches in diameter. Its ends are soldered into the lower portion of a flower, which bears on its expanded petals a circular seal of about 2 1/8 inches in diameter. This seal, which I have figured in the *Epigraphia Indica* (Vol. III, p. 104, No. 4 of the Plate), bears, in relief, a bull couchant which faces the proper right and is flanked by two ornamented lamp-stands. Above the bull are an indistinct figure (perhaps a squatting male person) and a crescent, and above these a parasol between two *chauris*. Below the bull is the Grantha legend *Prabhumeru*. From the Udayendiram plates of the Bana king Vikramaditya II. We learn that his great-grandfather had the name or surname Prabhumeru. The occurrence of this name on the seal of the subjoined grant suggests that the Ganga king Prithivipati II. adopted a Bana *biruda* and placed it on his seal when the Bana kingdom was bestowed on him by the Chola king Parantaka I. As, however, the seal-ring had been already cut when Mr. Foulkes examined the plates, the possibility remains that, as in the case of the inscription No. 74, the present seal may have originally belonged to another set of plates, perhaps to those of Vikramaditya II.

The first five plates bear 28 Sanskrit verse in the Grantha alphabet. The alphabet and laguage of the two last plates (and of a portion of the last line of plate *Vb*) is Tamil. A few Tamil letters are used in the middle of the Sanskrit portion, *viz.,* zei of *Vaimbalguri* in line 42, rum of *Sripurambiya* in line 45, and re of *Parivi* in line 62. A few words in Sanskrit prose and Grantha characters occur at the beginning of plate *I* and at  
the end plate *VII* (*svasti sri,* I. 1, *and* on namo Narayanaya, *I. 101).*
