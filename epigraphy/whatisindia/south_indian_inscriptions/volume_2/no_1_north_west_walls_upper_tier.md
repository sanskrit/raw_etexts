[TABLE]

This inscription consists of nine sections engraved on the north wall and four sections on the west wall of the central shrine. It opens with a Sanskrit sloka, according to which it is an edict of Rajaraja, (alias) Rajakesarivarman. The remainder of the inscription, like all the other Tanjavur inscriptions, is written in Tamil.

After the list of conquests, which is found at the beginning of many inscriptions of the Chola king Rajaraja, paragraph 5 contains the date, after which this and all the other Tanjavur inscriptions were incised. On the 20^(th) day of the 26^(th) year of his reign, Ko-Rajakesarivarman, alias Rajarajadeva, issued orders, that the gifts made by himself those made by his elder sister (viz., Kundavaiyar), those made by his wives, land those made by other donors should be engraved on the stone walls of the temple. A second important fact, which we learn from paragraph 2, is, that the Tanjavur temple had been built by Rajarajadeva himself, and that it was called after him Rajarajesvara, i.e., the Isvara (temple) of Rajaraja.

Paragraphs 3 to 107 contain a list of gold images, vessels and ornaments, which the king himself presented to the temple of Rajarajesvara (paragraphs 3 to 98) and to the image of Dakshina-Meru-Vitankar (paragraphs 99 to 107) on the following dates: -

Paragraphs 3 and 4: 25^(th) years, 312^(th) day

Paragraphs 5 to 9:26^(th) year 14^(th) day.

Paragraphs 10to 16: 26^(th) year, 27^(th) day.

Paragraphs 17: 26^(th) years, 34^(th) day.

Paragraphs 18: 25^(th) year, 275^(th) day.

Paragraphs 19 to 32: 26^(th) year, 104^(th) day

Paragraphs 33: 26^(th) year, 318^(th) day

Paragraphs 34 to 50: 26^(th) year, 319^(th) day.

Paragraphs 51 to 107: 23d to 29^(th) year.

The last set of paragraphs (51 to 107) was incised at a later date than the preceding part of the inscription, to which it refers as previously engraved (paragraph 51).

Part of the gifts, which the king made between his 23^(rd) and 29^(th) year, were taken from the treasures, which he seized after having defeated the Chera king and the Pandya in Malainadu[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_1_north_west_walls_upper_tier.html#_ftn1) (paragraphs 34, 51, 52 and 107). A number of gold trumpets were presented to the temple, after he had assumed the titles of Sivapadasekhara, â€˜the devotee of Siva,â€™ and of Rajaraja, â€˜the king of kingsâ€™ (paragraph 55), and a number of gold flowers, after he had returned from the conquest of Satyasraya (paragraph 92).

Each of the gifts is stated to have been weighed by â€˜the stone called (after) Adavallau.â€™ This was evidently a standard weight for gold, or a set of such weights, made of stone and preserved at the shrine of the god Adavallan or Adavallar, who was also called Dakshina-Meru-Vitankar.[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_1_north_west_walls_upper_tier.html#_ftn2)
