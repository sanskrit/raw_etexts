The original of this inscription is divided into two sections of nine lines each. At the commencement of each line of the first section, a few syllables are lost, and the first five lines of the same section are considerably damaged about the middle. In the first line the date is lost. As, however, the preserved part of the historical passage, with which the line opens, agrees literally with the corresponding passage of No.4, the inscription cannot have been engraved before the 29^(th) year of the reign of Rajarajadeva. Like No. 4, this inscription specifies the revenue in paddy and the revenue in gold, to be paid by a number of villages which Rajarajadeva had given to the temple.
