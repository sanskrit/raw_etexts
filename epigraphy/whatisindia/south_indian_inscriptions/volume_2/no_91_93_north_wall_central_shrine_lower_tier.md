This inscription contains a list of silver utensils presented by king Rajarajadeva to the temple. They are said to have borne the names Sivapadasegaran and Sri-Rajarajan[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_91_93_north_wall_central_shrine_lower_tier.html#_ftn2) and to have been procured from three sources, *viz.,* (1) the kingâ€™s treasures, (2) the booty acquired in the war against the Chera king and the Pandyas in Malai-nadu and (3) the silver seized in the same campaign. The list, however, begins with the gifts made from the treasures seized after defeating the Chera king and the Panyas in Malai-nadu. No mention of the other two items occurs in the preserved portion of the inscription. But as lines 2 to 4 are considerably damaged, causing almost the complete disappearance of several paragraphs in each case, we cannot be quite sure that the other two items are not mentioned. In fact as the enumeration of the vessels is repeated in different parts of the inscription, it may be presumed that the other items are also referred to in the damaged portions. For instance, bowls (*mandai*) are enumerated in paragraphs 43 to 59 and in paragraphs 128 â€“ 9; censers (*kalasappana*i) in paragraphs 65 to 75 as well as in paragraph 122; small baskets in paragraph 81 as well as in 130; spittoons (*padikkam*) in paragraph 107 as well as in 139. It is very unlikely that the utensils described in the latter part of the inscription were omitted by mistake when the earlier part was engraved. At the end of the inscription three images of Sri-Vasudeva made of silver are mentioned. Perhaps these were made from the silver seized in the campaign against the Chera king and the Pandyas in Malai-nadu. The gold emblems and ornaments seized in the same war are referred to in No. 1, paragraph 51, No. 3, paragraphs 5 and 6, No. 59, paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 9 and 11 and in No. 93 below.

It is worthy of note that this is the only inscription of the temple, which mentions presents made of silver. Most of the other inscriptions record gifts of gold. It looks as if the king had more gold and precious stones at his disposal than silver.
