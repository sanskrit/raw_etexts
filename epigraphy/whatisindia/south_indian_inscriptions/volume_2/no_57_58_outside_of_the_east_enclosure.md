This inscription is engraved on the left of the entrance to the second *gopura*,[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_57_58_outside_of_the_east_enclosure.html#_ftn1) the inside of which bears the inscriptions Nos. 24 to 28. Paragraph 1 states, that it is the continuation of another inscription, now much obliterated, to the north of â€œthe gate of Rajaraja,â€? *i.e.,* to the right of the second *gopura.* As the preserved portion of the inscription is not dated, it remains doubtful if it has to be assigned to the reign of Rajarajadeva or to that of Rajendra-Choladeva. It consists of a list of villages, which had to supply watchmen for the temple.
