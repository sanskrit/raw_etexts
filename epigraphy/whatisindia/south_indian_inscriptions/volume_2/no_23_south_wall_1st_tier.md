This inscription contains an order of king Tirumalaideva, by which a number of villages were exempted from taxes. This was probably done, because they had been granted to the Tanjavur temple. The date of the inscription is Saka 1377 (*expired*), the cyclic year *Yuvan, i.e.,* A.D. 1455. Consequently, the king to whose reign it belongs, must be distinct from the Karnata king Tirumalaideva, whose four inscriptions near Velur are dated in Saka 1488 (*expired*). It is not impossible that Tirumalaideva is identical with Timma, the founder of the second dynasty of Vijayanagara, for whose grandson Narasa, Nrisimha or Narasimha we have the dates Saka 1404 and 1418. In favour of this identification it can be adduced, that in the subjoined inscription, Tirumalaideva receives the same *birudas,* which were borne by Narasimhadeva according to an inscription at Virinchipuram, and that some of the fiscal terms, which occur in the text of the royal order, are of Kanarese extraction.

Both the spelling and the execution of this inscription are not very careful.[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_23_south_wall_1st_tier.html#_ftn1)
Lines 2 to 6 are damaged by a crack, which has caused the loss of a few letters. The language is Tamil, with the exception of line 1, which consists of a Sanskrit *sloka.*
