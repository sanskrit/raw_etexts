**No.24 In the inner gopura, on the left of the entrance**

This inscription is dated in the 29^(th) year of the reign of Ko-Rajakesarivarman, *alias* Rajarajadeva, and opens with the same historical passage as Nos. 1 to 3.[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_24_25_inner_gopura_left_entrance.html#_ftn1) It records two deposits of money, which were made by an officer of king Rajarajadeva in favour of the chief idol of the Rajarajesvara temple, and of the image of Dakshina-Meru-Vitankar. The first deposit was lent to the inhabitants of a *bazaar* at Tanjavur, who had in exchange to supply cardamom seeds and *champaka* buds, and the second deposit to certain villagers, who had to supply *khaskhas* roots. These three kinds of drugs were used for scenting the bathing-water of the two gods.
