The rock-cut Saiva shrine at Vallam near Chingleput bears two Tamil inscriptions. One of them, which belong to the 13^(th) century A.D., is engraved on the lower portion of the right door-pillar.[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_72_74_cave_inscription_at_vallam.html#_ftn1) It records the gift of a lamp in the 14^(th) year of Sakalabhuvana-chakravartin Kopperunjingadeva[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_72_74_cave_inscription_at_vallam.html#_ftn2) (*i.e.,* Ko-Perum-Simhadeva) to the temple of Vayandisura (*i.e.,* Vasantesvara) at Vallam in Valla-nadu, (*a subdi*vision) of Kalattur-kottam.[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_72_74_cave_inscription_at_vallam.html#_ftn3) The second, very archaic inscription is engraved on the upper portions of both door-pillars and records that the temple was built by Skandasena, the son of Vasantapriyaraja, who was a vassal of Mahendrapotaraja. From the later inscription of Kopperunjingadeva, it follows further that Skandasena called the temple Vasantesvara after his father Vasanta. Mahaendrapotaraja, whose vassal Vasanta professes to be, must have been a Pallava king. This already suggested by the first part of his name, which occurs twice in the list of the Pallavas, as far as it is known (Vol. I, p. 11). The second part of the kingâ€™s name Potaraja,[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_72_74_cave_inscription_at_vallam.html#_ftn4) forms part of Isvarapotaraja,[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_72_74_cave_inscription_at_vallam.html#_ftn5) as the Pallava king Paramesvaravarman I is called in a grant of Vikramaditya I. (Vol. I, p. 145), and of Nandipotaraja,[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_72_74_cave_inscription_at_vallam.html#_ftn6) which is used as an equivalent of Nandivarman in the Kaskudi plates (No. 73 below, line 90). Finally, the *birudas*, which the king receives in the Vallam cave-inscription, have their parallels in other Pallava inscriptions. With Lalitankura compare Lalita and Nayankura in the Dharmaraja Ratha inscription (Vol. I, p. 3). Satrumalla and Gunabhara occur also in the two cave-inscriptions on the Trichinopoly rock (Vol. I, p. 29). Though *birudas* are a somewhat unsafe basis for identification, it may be provisionally assumed that both the Trichinopoly cave-inscriptions of Gunabhara, *alias* Satrumalla, and the vallam cave-inscription of Mahendrapotaraja belong to one of the two Pallava kings called Mahendravarman, *i.e.,* to the first half of the seventh century of our era.[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_72_74_cave_inscription_at_vallam.html#_ftn7)

Kandasenan (*Skandasena*), the son of Vayandappiriaresaru (*Vasantapriyaraja*), the servant of Pagappidugu[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_72_74_cave_inscription_at_vallam.html#_ftn8) Lalidanguran (*Lalitankura*) Satturummallan (*Satrumalla*) Kunabaran (*Gunabhara*) Mayendirappottaresaru (*Mahendrapotaraja*), caused (*this*) temple (*devakula*) to be made.

On the 30^(th) April 1891, Professor Julien Vinson, of Paris, was good enough to send me a reprint[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_72_74_cave_inscription_at_vallam.html#_ftn9) of his paper *Specimen de Paleographie Tamoule*, which contains an analysis of, and extracts from, the subjoined copperplate inscription. The original plates had been discovered in 1879 at Kasakudi, 4 kilometers from Karaikkal (Karikal), by M. Jules de la Fon, of Pondicherry. Professor Vinsonâ€™s paper, which is based on a tracing prepared by M. de la Fon, convinced me of the importance of the inscription and induced m to apply through Government to His Excellency the Governor of the French Settlements in India for a loan of the original plates. This request was most graciously and promptly complied with. After I had transcribed the plates and prepared impressions of them, they were returned to their present owner.

The Kasakudi copperplates, eleven in number, are strung on a ring. On this is soldered the royal seal, with the figure of a bull which faces the left and is surmounted by a *linga*. The bull was the crest of the Pallavas, while their banner bore the figure of Sivaâ€™s club (*khatvanga*). The Grantha and Tamil characters of the inscription resemble those of the Kuram plates (Vol. I, No. 151). The major portion of the inscription is in the Sanskrit language (lines 1 to 104). The particulars of the grant are repeated, with considerable additions, in the Tamil language (II. 104 to 133). The concluding portion of the inscription is again in Sanskrit (II. 133 to 138), with a short parenthetical note in Tamil (1. 137).

The immediate object of the inscription is to record the grant of a village, made in the 22^(nd) year of the reign (II. 80 and 105) of the Pallava king Nandivarman (verses 27 and 30 and 1. 79). As in other Pallava copperplate inscriptions, the grant proper is preceded by a panegyrical account of the kingâ€™s ancestors, which adds a large number of new details to our knowledge of the Pallava history. After nine benedictory verses, the author names the following mythical ancestors of the Pallava dynasty: -
