**INTRODUCTION**

As it is intended to write in the next volume of this series about the ancestors of Rajaraja I and the Cholas generally, it is enough here to put together all that is known about the life and reign of this king. The nature of the materials available to us precludes any details about his private life. The personal history of a sovereign who lived in the eleventh century and about whose times no contemporary historian has left us any information must consist mainly of surmises and inferences from the few facts that are known of his public life.

The original name of the king was Rajarajakesarivarman or Rajakesarivarman Mummadisoradeva, which occurs, in his earliest Tamil inscriptions. The Tiruvalangadu plates[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/introduction.html#_ftn1) call him Arunmorivarman. This name, in the slightly altered form Arumorideva, occurs also in some of the Tamil records of his reign. The composer of the Tiruvalangadu plateâ€™s remarks that at the birth of prince Arunmorivarman[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/introduction.html#_ftn2) â€œthe wives of the serpent (Adisesha who is supposed to carry the earth on his back) danced for joy in the belief that he would relieve their husband of the burden of bearing the earth.â€? Rajakesarivarman Mummadisora was the second son of the Chola king Parantaka II *alias* Sundra-Chola, who was also known as Ponmaligaittunjinadeva[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/introduction.html#_ftn3) â€œthe king who died at the Golden Hallâ€? (*i.e.,* the temple Chidambaram). According to the Tiruvalangadu plates, Sundara-Cholaâ€™s queen Vanavanmahadevi is stated to have committed *suttee*. Apparently the parents of Rajarajadeva were spending their last days at Chidambaram as Saiva devotees. It was evidently this aspect of their life that appealed most strongly to their daughter who set up images to each of them in the Tanjore temple and made an endowment for their worship (No. 6)

So far as we know Rajarajadeva had an elder sister and an elder brother. The latter was called Aditya-Karikala and all that is known of him is that he fought in his youth with Vira-Pandya. In stone inscriptions he is known as â€œParakesarivarman, who took the head of Vira-Pandya.â€? The name of Rajarajaâ€™s elder sister was Kundavaiyar. She had married a certain Vallavaraiyar Vandyadevar (Nos.2, 6, 7 and 8) about whom nothing more is known. It is evident that she spent her later life in Tanjore with her younger brother and that she even survived him. We may suppose that Rajarajadeva entertained a high regard for her and that she exercised considerable influence over him and contributed in no small degree to the formation of his character. [\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/introduction.html#_ftn4) These were the surroundings under which the king was brought up. It will now be necessary to briefly review the history of the Cholas of Tanjore for a proper appreciation of the position, which Rajaraja occupies in South-Indian history. The founder of the family was Vijayalaya who established Tanjore as the capital of the dynasty. His son and successor, Aditya I conquered the Pallavas, and his son ParantakaI was continually fighting against the Pandyas and kept them effectually under control. Towards the end of his reign the Rashtrakutas under Krishna III invaded the Tamil country, killed the Chola prince Rajaditya and seized Tondai-nadu, which they seem to have ruled for about a quarter century. During this period the Cholas had to confine themselves to their hereditary dominions in the Trichinopoly and Tanjore districts. Aditya-Karikala appears to have regained Tondai-Nadu, as inscriptions dated in his reign have been found in Ukkal and other villages of that province. Apparently on his death or on the death of his father â€“ whichever was the later â€“ the succession was disputed. The subjects besought Arunmorivarman, *i.e,* Rajarajadeva to become king, but he did not want the throne as long as his paternal uncle Madhurantaka Uttama-Chola was fond of his country. Eventually Arumorivarman was appointed heir-apparent while Madhurantaka â€œbore the burden of the earthâ€?. It looks as if the former was a minor when his father or elder  
borther died.

It is not necessary to give a detailed account to how the date of accession of Rajarajadeva has been arrived at. Professor Kielhorn has examined a number of dates of the king with astronomical details and has come to the conclusion that his accession took place between the 25^(th) June and 25^(th) July 985 A.D.

Turning to the military achievements of the king which are mentioned in thousands of his inscriptions found over a large part of the Madras Presidency, we find that until the 8^(th) year of his reign = A.D. 994 he did not undertake any expedition. During this period he was probably engaged in recruiting an efficient army and otherwise preparing himself for the struggle, which he must have thought he should undertake before the Chola power and prestige could be restored.

In his first campaign the king is said to have destroyed a fleet in the port of Kandalur, which appears to have been situated in the dominions of the Chera King. The Tiruvalangadu plates, which furnish a lengthy account of Rajarajaâ€™s campaigns, do not mention this item at all. They begin with the war against the Pandyas and report that Rajaraja seized the Pandya king Amarabhujanga and that the Chola general captured the port of Virinam. Perhaps Kandalur or Kandalur-Salai was near Virinam. It is not unlikely that the Chola king fought, on more than one occasion, against the Pandyas. The Cheras and Pandyas appear to have been allied together in their war against the Chola king, for in the Tanjore inscriptions reference is frequently made to the conquest of the Chera king and the Pandyas in Malai-nadu, *i.e.,* the West Coast (Nos. 1, 59, 91, etc.). Kandalur-Salai, which is stated to belong to the Chera king in later inscriptions, was probably held by the Pandyas when it was attached by Rajaraja.

Before his 14^(th) year = A.D. 998-99, Rajarajadeva conquered Vengai-nadu, *i.e.,* the Eastern Chalukya territory, Gangapadi and Nurambapadi which formed part of the present Mysore State, Tadigaipadi, the situation of which has not been made out satisfactorily.[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/introduction.html#_ftn5) According to Eastern Chalukya copper-plate grants, the kingdom of Vengi was without a ruler about this time. The interregnum in the Vengi country, which preceded the reign of Saktivarman, is said to have lasted 27 years. On a previous occasion[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/introduction.html#_ftn6) I pointed out that this interregnum probably came to an end in A.A. 999, when the Cholas invaded Vengi. Accordingly it may be presumed that Rajaraja restored order and peaceful government in Vengi by  
placing Saktivarman on the throne.
