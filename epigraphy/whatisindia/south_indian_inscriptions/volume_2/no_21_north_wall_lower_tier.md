This inscription is dated â€˜on the seventh day of the year which was opposite to the fifty yearâ€™ of Tribhuvanachakravartin Konerinmai-kondan. As I have shown in a paper on the Tirunelli deed of Bhaskara Ravivarman, which will shortly appear in the *Indian Antiquary*, the word â€˜oppositeâ€™ (*edir*) is used in Tamil dates in the sense of â€˜after.â€™ â€˜Accordingly, this inscription is dated in the year which followed after the fifth year, *i.e.,* in the sixth year of the kingâ€™s reign. The name of the king has remained a puzzle and has been misread in various ways, until my assistant discovered an archaic inscription at Kuttalam near Mayavaram, in which it is spelt. This spelling, â€” if compared with the usual forms, and â€“ shows that the first part of the name must be divided into. From the assimilated form, which occurs in an inscription at Pallavaram, we may further conclude that is meant for must be dissolved into â€˜a kingâ€™ â€˜equality,â€™ and is an abstract of the root, which signifies negation. *Ko-ner-l-mai-kondan* may thus be translated by â€˜he who has assumed the title â€œking of kings,â€?â€™ a surname of the Chera king Bhaskara Ravivarman, to whose reign the Cochin deed of the Jews[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_21_north_wall_lower_tier.html#_ftn1) belongs. Koneril or Koneril appears to have been corrupted subsequently into Koneri. For, we find the surname Koneri-mel-kondan or Koneri-men-konda applied to Vira-Chola and to Kulottunga-Choladeva; and on a coin,[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_21_north_wall_lower_tier.html#_ftn2) copies of which are not rarely met with at Tanjore and Madura, the legend is Koneri-rayan.

The title Konerinmai-kondan is applied to the Chola king Rajarajadeva in the large Leyden grant (line 112); to Kulottunga-Choladeva in an inscription at Karuvur; and to Sundara-Pandya in an inscription of the Madura temple,[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_21_north_wall_lower_tier.html#_ftn3) in the cave-inscription at Tirupparankunram,[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_21_north_wall_lower_tier.html#_ftn4) in the smaller Tiruppuvanam grant,[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_21_north_wall_lower_tier.html#_ftn5) and in inscriptions at Perur.[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_21_north_wall_lower_tier.html#_ftn6) The same surname was borne by Vira-Pandya and by Kulasekharadeva.[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_21_north_wall_lower_tier.html#_ftn7) The king to whose reign the present inscription belongs, must be different from, and considerably later than, Rajarajadeva, whose inscriptions are written in archaic characters, while those of the subjoined inscription are not very far removed from the modern Tamil ones. There is no such objection to identifying the Konerinmai-kondan of the subjoined inscription with one of the three Pandya kings, who had that surname. But it is impossible to make any final identification, as the inscription does not contain any historical particulars about the king to whose reign it belongs.

The inscription records an order of the king, by which certain lands that had been wrongfully sold during the third and fourth years of his reign were restored to the temple of Rajaraja-Isvara at Tanjavur.
