[TABLE]

This inscription records that a native of Nallur *alias* Panchavanmadevi-chaturvedimangalam in Nallur-Nadu, a district of Nittavinoda-valanadu, set up a copper image of Durga-Paramesvari and presented a number of ornaments to it.

The preservation of the inscription is not very good. The second, third and fourth faces of the first pillar are mutilated. But the missing *aksharas* have been supplied in the majority of cases from the context.

[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_79_81_3_pillars_of_south_enclosure.html#_ftnref1) This translation presumes that the expression koilil muzhathal is used for koil muzhuthal. A similar used of the locative for the genitive occurs in kali onetril kanil (above, page 15, paragraph 20) and in irandantharathil muthal (above, page 22, paragraph 3). But it is not unlikely that the locative koilil has to be taken with alanthu, in which case the expression would signify that the weighing and measuring were actually done in the temple.

[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_79_81_3_pillars_of_south_enclosure.html#_ftnref2) The word *bhadra* occurs in two other inscriptions in the description of a pedestal (above, page 223, paragraph 4 and page 225, paragraph 4)

[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_79_81_3_pillars_of_south_enclosure.html#_ftnref3) According to Monier Williamsâ€™ Sanskrit Dictionary means â€˜an ear-ringâ€™

[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_79_81_3_pillars_of_south_enclosure.html#_ftnref4) This term occurs also in No. 51, paragraph 13 and N. 56, paragraphs 7 and 9.

[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_79_81_3_pillars_of_south_enclosure.html#_ftnref5) *Ekavalli* is apparently the same as the Sanskrit *ekavali* (*eavali* in Prakrit), which occurs in Kalidasaâ€™s *Vikramaorvasiya* (Bombay edition, page 19). Mr. S. P. Pandit remarks on the word that it â€œis a long gold or pearl necklace reaching up to the feet, such as is seen on the large statues of gods in the caves of Badami.â€?

[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_79_81_3_pillars_of_south_enclosure.html#_ftnref6) This term does not occur anywhere else in the Tanjore inscriptions.

[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_79_81_3_pillars_of_south_enclosure.html#_ftnref7) The terms *odani* and *nilaiyani* occur in No. 2 above, paragraph 11.

[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_79_81_3_pillars_of_south_enclosure.html#_ftnref8) This term occurs also in No. 44 above, paragraph 9.

[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_79_81_3_pillars_of_south_enclosure.html#_ftnref9) The term *ma* as a fraction of a *manjadi* means â€˜a tenthâ€™ and not as it is commonly used in Tamil â€˜a twentieth;â€™ see page 36 above, note 1. Similarly, the word *kani*, as a fraction of a *manjadi*, means â€˜a fortieth;â€™ see above page 65, note 1.

[\[10\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_79_81_3_pillars_of_south_enclosure.html#_ftnref10) No. 28 of 1897

[\[11\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_79_81_3_pillars_of_south_enclosure.html#_ftnref11) Four different varieties of the goddess Pidari are known to us from the same epigraph, *viz.,* Punnaitturai-nangai, Poduvagai-ur-udaiyal, Kuduraivattam-udaiyal and Tiruval-udaiyal.

[\[12\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_79_81_3_pillars_of_south_enclosure.html#_ftnref12) On this term see p. 223 above, note 1; compare also the term siruthanthuperuntharam on p. 224, above, 1. 4 f.
