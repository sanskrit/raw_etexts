This inscription records that, on the 242^(nd) day of the 19^(th) year of this reign, Rajendra-Choladeva granted a yearly allowance of paddy to a Saiva priest of the Rajarajesvara temple. He issued this order from his palace at Gangaikonda-Sorapuram.[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_20_south_wall_1st_2nd_tiers.html#_ftn1)

The most important part of the inscription is the end of its historical introduction, which adds a number of names of places, which the king had conquered between his 12^(th) and 19^(th) year, to those mentioned in two Tirumalai inscriptions of the 12^(th) year.[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_20_south_wall_1st_2nd_tiers.html#_ftn2) Among these additional names of localities I can identify none but the last, *viz.,* Kadaram (line 11), whose king, called Samgramavijayottungavarman, was attacked by sea and caught (II. 8 f). This king must have been a successor of Maravijayaottungavarman, the son of Chudamanivarman and king of Kataha or Kidaram, who is mentioned in the large Leyden grant[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_20_south_wall_1st_2nd_tiers.html#_ftn3) as a vassal of Rajaraja. Kidaram is now the headquarters of a talluqa of the Ramnad Zamindari in the Madura district.[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_20_south_wall_1st_2nd_tiers.html#_ftn4) The remaining names of localities, which I am unable to identify, must probably be looked for in the same neighbourhood, as the inscription seems to imply that they were all taken from the king of Kadaram, together with Kadaram itself, which is the last item in the list.

In the beginning of each line of the second tier of this inscription, a few letters are lost. Most of these can be supplied with certainty from other inscriptions of Rajendra-Chola. Those letters, which are lost at the beginning of lines 9 to 11, are taken from an undated inscription of the Kailasanatha temple at Uttaramallur. The Bilvanathesvara temple at Tiruvallam contains inscriptions of the 21^(st), 26^(th) and \[3\] 1^(st) years of Rajendra-Chola.[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_20_south_wall_1st_2nd_tiers.html#_ftn5) Owing to their imperfect preservation, these were of very little use for the restoration of the text. As the historical passage at their beginning adds nothing new to that of the subjoined inscription, they serve at least to prove, that Rajendra-Chola did not make any further conquests after the 19^(th) year of his reign.
