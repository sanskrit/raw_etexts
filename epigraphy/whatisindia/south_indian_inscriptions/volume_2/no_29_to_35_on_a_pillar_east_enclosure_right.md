This inscription describes a number of copper images, which king Rajarajadeva had set up in the Rajarajesvara temple before the 29^(th) year of his reign. These images were probably arranged in two groups, which represented two successive scenes from the life of the *Saiva* saint Chandesvara, as described in the *Periyapuranam.* The first group may have consisted of a *linga* (Mahadeva, paragraph 8), of a statue of Chandesvara who worshipped it (paragraph 10), and of one of his father,[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_29_to_35_on_a_pillar_east_enclosure_right.html#_ftn1) who was killed by his own son, because he obstructed the worship of Siva (paragraph 11). The second group was probably composed of Siva and his consort (paragraph 2 and 5), and of Chandesvara (paragrapha 12), who received a flower-garland from Siva as a reward for his devotion (paragrapah 13).
