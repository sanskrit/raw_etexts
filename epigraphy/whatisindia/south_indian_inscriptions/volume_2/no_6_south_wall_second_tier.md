This and the next inscription, though of different date, are engraved continuously in two sections. No. 6 fills the whole of the first section and part of the first line of the second section.

The inscription describes a number of gifts, which were made until the 29^(th) year of the reign of Ko-Rajakesarivarman, alias Rajarajadeva, by Arvar Parantakan Kundavaiyar, who was the elder sister of Rajarajadeva and the queen of Vallavaraiyar Vandyadevar. As, according to the large Leyden grant,[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_6_south_wall_second_tier.html#_ftn1) Rajaraja was the son of Parantaka II. It is evident that the name of his sister, Parantakan Kundavaiyar, is an abbreviation for Parantakan magal Kundavaiyar, i.e., Kundavaiyar, the daughter of Parantaka (II.).

Paragraph 2 records a gift of gold to the same two goddesses, who are mentioned in the inscription No.2.[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_6_south_wall_second_tier.html#_ftn2) According to paragraph 1, these two images had been set up in the temple of Rajarajesvara by Kundaaiyar herhself. The same princess had set up an image of her mother, to which she presented certain ornaments (paragraphs 3 to 5). Other ornaments were given to the image of the god Dakshina-Meru-Vitankar (paragraphs 6 and 7), which had been set up by king Rajarajadeva (paragraph 1), and to his consort (paragraphs 8 and 9), who was one of the two goddesses referred to in paragraph 2. The remainder of the inscription treats of endowments to these two goddesses (paragraph 10), to the image of Ponmaligaittunjina-devar (paragraph 14), and to the image of the mother of Kundavaiyar (paragraph 19). These endowments were made in the following manner. Kundavaiyar deposited certain sums of money (kasu), which were subsequently borrowed on interest by the inhabitants of certain villages from the shrine of Chandesvara (paragrah 1), the saint in whose name the money affairs of temples are generally transacted.[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_6_south_wall_second_tier.html#_ftn3) The interest had to be paid yearly into the treasury of the Rajarajesvara temple at Tanjavur either in paddy[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_6_south_wall_second_tier.html#_ftn4) or in money. In the former case, the interest was three kuruni of paddy for each kasu, and in the latter 12Â½ per cent. If it assumed that the rate of interest was the same in both cases, one kasu would correspond to the value of 24 kuruni or 2 kalam of paddy. In two instances (paragraphs 18 and 21), money was deposited for purchasing a number of sheep, from the milk of which two private individuals had to supply daily a certain amount of ghee for lamps.[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_6_south_wall_second_tier.html#_ftn5) The value of one sheep was reckoned as 1/3 kasu. In paragraphs 14 and 19, the value of various daily requirements is given in measures of paddy; the whole list probably represents the daily wants of a single punjari.
