These plates were discovered in 1911 by the late Rai Bahadur V. Venkayya, M.A., in the village Velurpalaiyam, about 7 miles north-west of Arkonam in the North Arcot district. They have since been purchased by the Government for deposit in the Madras Museum. A detailed description of the plates and their contents has appeared in the Epigraphical Report for 1911, Part II, paragraphs 5 to 12. Mr. Venkayya also, has published a valuable note on them in the *Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society* for 1911, pp. 521 ff.

The plates are five in number and consist of eight written sides, the outer faces of the first and last being completely blank. They vary in length from 9 5/8â€? to 9 Â¾â€?, and are slightly convex on their right and left sides. The breadth of each plate is about 3Â½ .The ring which holds the plates together is oval-shaped, and measures 7â€? x 6Â¼ while the circular seal in whose massive bottom the edges of the ring are firmly fixed, is 3 Â¼â€? in diameter. The seal bears on a depressed surface an elongated figure of a Pallava bull in a recumbent posture facing the proper right with an ornamental lamp-stand on either side of it. The bull and the lamp-stand are placed on a straight line, which is perhaps to be taken for the surface of a pedestal. Below this latter, there appear the faint traces of an expanded lotus flower. Above the bull are engraved in one row, eight symbols of which a goddess (perhaps Lakshmi), flanked by two lamp-stands occupies the center. Another symbol which is recognizable in the *svastika*. The remaining four are indistinct. Above these again are the insignia of royalty, *viz.,* two *chauris* mounted on handles and a parasol between them. Right round the margin of the seal is a defaced legend in Pallava-Grantha characters of which the syllables . . . . . . . . *va-nathasya Nan*\[*tipa*\] *nmas*\[*ya*\] *bhu*\[*pa\**\]*teh* \[I\*\] *visva-*\[*vi*\]*sva*\[*m*\]*bharapala srih,* are visible. The plates including ring and seal weigh 394 *tolas*.

The inscription on the plates is engraved partly in Grantha and partly in Tamil characters. The writing discloses two different scripts, the first of which (II. 1 to 28) is somewhat less deeply cut and slanting. The *virama* or the *pulli* in the Tamil portion of the inscription is marked almost regularly throughout, by a zigzag line resembling the final *m* of Grantha or by the usual dot. The grant consists of 31 Sanskrit verses intercepted in the middle by a prose passage in Tamil from lines 47 to 63, and including at the end a short Tamil sentence in lines 68 and 69. Verses 1 and 2 are invocations addressed to the Supreme Being and to Srikantha (Siva). The two next supply the legendary origin of the Pallavas from Vishnu, down to the eponymous king Pallava, through Brahma, Angiras, Brihaspati, Samyu, Bharadvaja, Drona, and Asvatthaman, and eulogise the family as being very powerful. From verse 5 to 8, we learn the names of some probably historical kings. One of them was Asokavarman in whose family was born Kalabhartri. His son was Chutapallava; his son, Virakurcha; from him came Skandasishya; from him, Kumaravishnu and after him, Buddhavarman. It is evident, as Professor Hultzsch has remarked, (above, p. 342), that Asokavarman â€œcan scarcely be considered a historical person, but appears to be a modification of the ancient Maurya king Asoka.â€? Kalabhartri is a possible synonym of Kanagopa, who is mentioned in the Kasakudi plates, in the group of kings that ruled after Asokavarman. Virakurcha, the grandson of Kalabhartri (Kanagopa), must be the Virakorchavarman whose name occurs as that of the great grandfather (of the donor) in an odd Pallava plate published by Professor Hultzsch in the *Epigraphia Indica* (Vol. I, p. 397 f.) and the same as Viravarman of the Pikira, Mangalur, lUruvupalli and the Chendalur grants, all of which belong practically to the same period. Virakurcha is stated to have married the daughter of a Naga chief[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_98_velurpalaiyam_plates_nandivarman.html#_ftn1) and through her, to acquire the insignia of royalty. Their son Skandasishya seized from king Satyasena the *ghatika* of the Brahmanas. The reference to a *ghatika* at this early period is very interesting. It occurs also in the Talagunda inscription of Kakusthavarman which is ascribed by Professor Kielhorn to about the first half of the 6^(th) century A.D.[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_98_velurpalaiyam_plates_nandivarman.html#_ftn2) Skandasishya is perhaps identical with the Pallava king of the same name, who is referred to in one of the Tirukkarukkunram inscriptions, as having made a gift to the holy temple of Mulasthana at that village. If Skandasishya is synonymous with Skandavarman as suggested by Mr. Venkayya in his article on the Tirukkarukkunram inscription, we shall have to identify him with Skandavarman II, particularly because the two generations after him supplied by the Velurpalaiyam plates, would, in this case, be the same as those found in the Chendalur plates of Kumaravishnu II. Satyasena, the king from whom Skandasishya seized the *ghatika*, remains unidentified. Kumaravishnu, the son of Skandasishya, is next stated to have captured Kanchi, and his son Buddhavarman to have been the conqueror of Cholas.

Mr. Venkayya mentions two distinct periods in early Pallava hviz. (1) the period in which their grants are recorded in the Prakrit language and (2) that in which the grants are in Sanskrit. The first has been tentatively assigned to the beginning of the 4^(th) century A.D. Evidently, the break suggested at the beginning of verse 5 in the Velurpalaiyam plates with the words â€œAsokavarman and others,â€? included this earlier period of the Prakrit kcharters, and counted within it such names as Sivaskandavarman, Vijayaskandavarman, Vijayabuddhavarman, Buddhyankura and Vishnugopa. The Sanskrit charters, which are to be referred probably to the 5^(th) and the 6^(th) centuries of the Christian era, supply the names of a number of Pallava kings who may now be arranged in order of succession, with the help of the information given in the Velurpalaiyam plates. The capture or rather the re-capture of Kanchi attributed to Kumaravishnu in these plates confirms Mr. Venkayyaâ€™s suggestion that town was not the Pallava capital for some time during the interval between the Prakrit period and the later Sanskrit period. Kalabharatri (Kanagopa) may have been the first of the kings of the second period, which lasted down to Buddhavarman according to out plates,
