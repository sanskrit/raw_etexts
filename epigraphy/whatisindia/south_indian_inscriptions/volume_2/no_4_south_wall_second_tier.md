The preserved part of this inscription comprises eight sections of nine lines each. The end of each line of the third section, the commencement of each line of the fourth section, and the whole of any other section, which may have intervened between the third and fourth, are covered by flight of steps, which was constructed at a period subsequent to that, during which the inscription had been incised.

The inscription specifies the revenue in paddy and the revenue in gold and in money (kasu), which a number of villages had to pay to the stone-temple, called Rajarajesvara, which Rajarajadeva had caused to be built at Tanjavur.[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_4_south_wall_second_tier.html#_ftn1) The villages were situated both in the Chola country and in other countries and had been assigned to the temple by Rajarajadeva until the 29^(th) year of his reign. The extent of the land, which the king had given to the temple in each of the villages, is recorded in great detail, by a land measure, the name of which is not stated, land by fractions of it. The paddy due to the temple and to be measured by â€˜the marakkal[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_4_south_wall_second_tier.html#_ftn2) called (after) Adavallanâ€™ i.e., by a corn measure which was preserved at the shrine of the god Adavallan;[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_4_south_wall_second_tier.html#_ftn3) and this marakkal was â€˜equal to a rajakesari.â€™ This term was evidently derived from Rajakesari, the surname of the reigning king Rajaraja and of other Chola kings,[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_4_south_wall_second_tier.html#_ftn4) and must be taken as the real name of the royal standard measure,[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_4_south_wall_second_tier.html#_ftn5) a copy of which was preserved at the temple. The only case, in which the revenue had to be paid in gold, occurs in paragraph 13. No instance of payment in money (kasu) occurs in the preserved part of the inscription.
