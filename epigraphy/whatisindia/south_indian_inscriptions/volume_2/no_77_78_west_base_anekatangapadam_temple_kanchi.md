In the first volume I published an inscription of Kambana-Udaiyar, which records that, in the time of Kulotltunga-Choladeva, the Rajasimhavarmesvara temple at Kanchipuram had been closed, its landed property sold, and its compound and environs transferred to the temple of Anaiyapatanga. This temple is situated close to the Raja-simhavarmesvara (now Kailasanatha) temple. In its inscriptions and in the *Devaram,* it bears the slightly different name Anekatangapadam. It contains three inscriptions, one of which records a private grant,[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_77_78_west_base_anekatangapadam_temple_kanchi.html#_ftn1) while the two others (Nos. 77 and 78) are dated during the reign of Kulottunga-Choladeva.

The king, to whose reign the inscriptions Nos. 77 and 78 belong, is identical with Kulottunga-Choladeva I. This follows from the fact that, in other inscriptions which open with the same introduction, he receives the surname Ko-Rajakesarivarman, which was borne by Kulottunga-Chola I., and that, in a few inscriptions with the same introduction, he is said to have put to flight Vikkala and Singana, who must be identified with Vikramaditya VI. And Jayasimha IV. Of the Western Chalukya dynasty.

The subjoined inscription records that, in the 20^(th) year of his reign, Kulottunga-Choladeva granted to the Siva temple of Anekatangapadam in Kanchipuram three *veli* of land in the village of Tamar, *alias* Nittavinodanallur, in Tamar-nadu, a subdivision of Tamar-kottam. According to Mr. Croleâ€™s *Chingleput Manual* (p. 439), the district of â€œTamal-kottamâ€? was situated in the west of the Conjeeveram talluqa The village of Tamar must be accordingly identified with the modern Damal.[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_77_78_west_base_anekatangapadam_temple_kanchi.html#_ftn2) As in an inscription of Kambanna-Udaiyar (Vol. I, No. 88), Kanchipuram is here said to have belonged to Eyir-kottam, a district of Jayankonda-Sora-mandalam. Eyil, after which the district of Eyir-kottam was called, must be distinct from the distant village of Eyil in the South Arcot district, with which I proposed to identify it on a former occasion. Perhaps the term Eyil, *i.e.,* â€˜the Fort,â€™ refers to Kanchipuram itself. Jayankonda-Sora-mandalam is another name of Tondaimandalam.

Hail! Prosperity! In the twentieth year (*of the reig*n) of Sri-Kulottunga-Soradeva, who,â€” while the goddess of Fame became renowned (*through him*), while the goddess of Victory was coveting (*him*), while the goddess of the Earth became brilliant (*with joy*), (*and*) while the goddess with the (*lotus*) flower (*i.e.,* Lakshmi) wedded (*him*),â€” had put on by right of inheritance the excellent crown of jewels; who had caused the wheel of this (authority) to roll over all regions, so that the Minavar (Pandyas) lost (*their*) firmness, the Villavar (Cheras) trembled, (*and*) the other kings were defeated and suffered disgrace;[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_77_78_west_base_anekatangapadam_temple_kanchi.html#_ftn3) and who, having anointed himself (*in commemoration of his*) victories, was graciously seated on the throne of heroes together with (*his queen*) Puvana-murd-udaiyal,[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_77_78_west_base_anekatangapadam_temple_kanchi.html#_ftn4)â€” the king was pleased to order that it should be engraved \[on stone\] and on copper that three *veils* of wet land (*nir-nilam*) were given,â€” for defraying the daily expenses,[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_77_78_west_base_anekatangapadam_temple_kanchi.html#_ftn5) including the *antarayam,* free of taxes, as a *devadana*, excluding one field (*pulam*) which is situated within (*the land granted, and*) which is a *devadana* of the temple of Bhimesvara within the village,â€” to (*the god*) Mahadeva of the holy Anekatangapadam (temple), who is the lord of Kanchipuram, a city in Eyir-kottam, (*a district*) of Jayankonda-Sora-mandalam.

(*The land granted*) is situated to the west of the village of Tamar, *alias* Nittavinodanallur, in Tamar-nadu, (*a subdivision*) of Tamar-kottam. The northern boundary (*is*) to the south of the temple of Ganapati. The eastern boundary touches the *kuri[](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_77_78_west_base_anekatangapadam_temple_kanchi.html#_ftn6)*[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_77_78_west_base_anekatangapadam_temple_kanchi.html#_ftn6) (*belonging*) to the temple (*kottam*) o Kumara, on the south of this the temple of Kali, and on the south of this the bottom of a sluice (*tumb-adi*). The southern boundary (*is*) to the north of a field (*seruvu*), which is a *tiruvidaiyattam*,[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_77_78_west_base_anekatangapadam_temple_kanchi.html#_ftn7) at the bottom of the sluice. The western boundary is to the east of the causeway (? *Manpadu*) on the bank of the tank.

The king having ordered thus, Kulottunga-Sora-Brahmarayan caused (*the above*) to the engraved on stone.

**No. 78. On the south base of the Anekatangapadam temple at Kanchipuram.**

Like No. 77, this inscription belongs to the time of Kulottunga-Choladeva I. It is dated in the 34^(th) year of his reign, the records that the king granted 2 *velis* of land to the Anekatangapadam temple at Kanchipuram. The land granted was situated in the southern portion of Kanchipuram, to the north of the temple of Tirukkarrali-Mahadeva, *i.e.,* of the Rajasimhavarmesvara (now Kailasanatha) temple, to the east of the hamlet of Putteri,[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_77_78_west_base_anekatangapadam_temple_kanchi.html#_ftn8) to the west of â€˜the royal wall of Rajendra-Chola,â€™[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_77_78_west_base_anekatangapadam_temple_kanchi.html#_ftn9) and to the south of the hamlet of Kir-Putteri, *i.e.,* â€˜Eastern Putteri.â€™

As the land granted bordered on the Kailasanatha temple, it is not impossible that it formed part of those gifts of Kulottunga-Choladeva, which were declared to be unlawful and were restored to the Kailasanatha temple in the time of Kambana-Udaiyar.
