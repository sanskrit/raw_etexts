This inscription is dated in the 7^(th) year of rajendra-Chola I. The kingâ€™s conquests end with the subjugation of the island of Sandimattivu. As we know that the invasion of the â€œmany ancient islandsâ€? immediately preceded this event and that it took place in the 6^(th) year, it may be concluded that the conquest of Sandimattivu must have taken place in the 7^(th) year of the kingâ€™s reign = A.D. 1018-19. The Tiruvalangadu plates tell us that Rajendra-Chola advanced against the Western Country because he had heard of the disgrace, which the kings of the earth had suffered at the hands of Parasurama. Not finding him on earth the Chola king desired to conquer the country reclaimed by him, which was protected against foreign invasion by the greatness of Parasuramaâ€™spenance. It is evident that the conquest of the island of Sandimattivu was the most important event of the campaign against Kerala, which must have taken place in A.D. 1018-19.

The subjoined inscription registers an endowment in money in favor of the image of Srikanthamurtigal set up by Prithivimahadeviyar, queen of Rajarajadeva. The money was lent out on interest to the members of the assembly of Narasinga-chaturvedimangalam, a *brahmadeya* in Avur-kurram, a subdivision of Nittavinoda-valanadu. The interest was to be paid in kind and amounted to thirty-seven *kalam*, one *tuni* and one *padakku* of paddy.

This and the next record belong to a class of Tanjore inscriptions, which are dated during the reign of Rajendra-Chola I. and register endowments by groups of men. To each of these groups a shrine in the temple was â€œattachedâ€? by order of the king.[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_82_83_base_of_south_enclosure.html#_ftn1)

This inscription is dated in the tenth year of Rajendra-Chola I. and registers an endowment in money in favour of the image of Mahameru-Vitanka, set up by Rajarajadeva, and of that of his consort. The money was lent out on interest to the members of the assembly of Narasinga-chaturvedimangalam mentioned in No. 82. In this case too, the interest was payable in kind and amounted to fifty *kalam* of paddy, which had to be delivered into Tanjai-Vidangan, the big treasury at Tanjavur.
