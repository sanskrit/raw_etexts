**No. 85. On a pillar of the west enclosure.**[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_84_to_90_pillar_of_west_enclosure.html#_ftn4)

This inscription belongs to the reign of rajendra-Chola I. and records the gift of copper, zinc and bell-metal vessels to the image of Ganapatiyar set up in the principal temple. This image was probably in the central shrine and was perhaps known as Alaiyattu-Pillaiyar as distinguished from the Parivaralaiyattu-Pillaiyar set up apparently in the enclosing verandah of the temple. A portion of the inscription is damaged  
(II. 23 to 30).
