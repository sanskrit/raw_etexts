The date and the historical introduction of this inscription are identical with those of No.24. It records two deposits of money, which were made by a manager of Rajarajesvara temple and lent out to the inhabitants of a certain village. The interest of the first deposit was to be paid in paddy and to be used for procuring various articles of consumption of thirteen yearly procession days. Paragraph 2 contains a list of these articles, which is as detailed as, and still more extensive than, the one given in the inscription No. 6, paragraphs 14 and 19. The interest of the second deposit was to be paid in money and to be used for purchasing camphor, which had to be burnt before the images of Rajarajesvara and Dakhina-Meru-Vitankar.
