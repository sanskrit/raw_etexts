This and the next inscription (No. 60) are engraved on the walls of the small shrine of Chandesvara, which is situated opposite to the North entrance of the central shrine of Rajarajesvara. No. 59 describes one diadem and nine girdles for the use of the image of Rajarajesvara, the chief idol of the temple. These ornaments were made partly of gold and jewels from the temple treasury, and partly of pearls, which king Rajarajadeva had presented to the temple before the 29^(th) year of his reign. A number of corals, which formed part of the ornaments, were purchased by the temple treasurers for gold, which the king had seized after conquering the Chera king and the Pandyas[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_59_to_62_east_north_west_walls_chandesvara_shrine.html#_ftn1) (paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 9 and 11) in Malainadu (paragraph 3).

This inscription is referred to as being engraved on the walls of the temple of Chandesvara in paragraph 1 of the inscription No. 3, which is a mere continuation of the present inscription.
