Tandantottam (i.e. Tandantottam, No. 134 of the Madras Survey map of the Kumbakonam taluk) is a village 6 miles east of Kumbakonam in the Tanjore district of the Madras Presidency. The existence of the plates was brought to the notice of the late RaiBahadur V. Venkayya, m.a., by Mr. Narayanaswami Aiyar, Sub-Inspector of Police, Madras City. It is stated that they â€œwere found with many other idols, while digging a foundation in the premises of a Siva temple in the village of Thandantottam, Kumbakonam taluk of Tanjore district, about 100 years ago. No one knew what it is and how they happened to be there.â€?

The plates are 14 in number, each measuring about 11 Â¼â€? by 3 Â¾ â€œ. When they were produced before Mr. Venkayya the plates were strung on a ring, which did not appear to have been previously cut.[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_99_tandanottam_plates_nandivikramavarman.html#_ftn1) The ring is somewhat oval with diameters measuring 6 Â½â€? and 7 Â¾â€?. Its ends are secured at the bottom of a circular seal 3â€? in diameter. The seal bears in relief a couchant Pallava bull facing the proper right. Along the margin of the seal is a Grantha legend, which is illegible. The ring on which the plates are strung was cut by me with the permission of Mr. Narayanaswami Aiyar in order to change out the plates and prepare ink-impressions.

The two sides of the first plate, the first side of the second plate and the first five lines of its second side are in Sanskrit verse, engraved in the Grantha alphabet and the rest, in the Tamil language and characters. The inscription must originally have consisted of many more plates, two or three of which at least are missing at the beginning. These would have supplied a genealogy of the Pallava kings similar to that of the Velurpalaiyam plates of Vijaya-Nandivarman published above. The concluding words of some of the plates in the middle do not fit in with the opening words of the succeeding plates. Consequently, it is presumed that a few plates[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_99_tandanottam_plates_nandivikramavarman.html#_ftn2) of the grant portion are also lost. This presumption is confirmed by the fact that while the number of the donees according to the Sanskrit portion has to be 308, the number actually registered is only 244, even including those whose names seem to have been added subsequently in comparatively later characters, or at least in a different hand.

The first plate of the preserved portion begins by referring to a king who conquered the South and stating that a certain Hiranyavarman was born â€œagainâ€? for the â€œwelfare of the worldsâ€? (*jagatam hitaya* V. 1). His son was Nandivarman who perhaps held the *biruda* Ekadhira the next six verses are taken up with the praise of Nandivarman. Two historical facts referred to in this part of the inscription are interesting. One of them is that Nandivarman took away from the Ganga king a neck-ornament, which contained in it the gem called *Ugroday* (V. 6). The name of this Ganga king, however, is not furnished. The other is that Nandivarman was the owner of an elephant named *Pattavardhana* (V. 7). With the permission of the king, a certain Dayamukha caused a village to be granted to 308 Brahmanas and called it Dayamukha mangala after his own name (V. 9). The executor (ajnapti) o the grant was evidently the very same person Dayamukha entitled Kumara, who is stated to have been the kingâ€™s treasurer (V. 10). The composer of the eulogy (*prasasti*) was Paramesvara Uttarakaranika son of Param-Ottarakaranika (V. 14).

The Tamil portion is dated in the 58^(th) year of Kovijaya-Nandivikramavarman and registers a gift of land (converted into a
village[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_99_tandanottam_plates_nandivikramavarman.html#_ftn3)) lying to the west of Tandattottam (*i.e.* Tandantottam) in Tenkarai-Naraiyur-nadu, a district of the Chola country, to a number of Brahmanas of Nalgur[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_99_tandanottam_plates_nandivikramavarman.html#_ftn4)

To judge from the high regnal year, the Tandattottam plates must belong to the reign of that Pallava king Vijaya-Nandivikramavarman whose Tiruvallam rock inscription is dated in his 62^(nd) year *i.e.,* 4 years later than our plates. At the same time the alphabet of the plates and the name of the king lead us to infer that the Vijaya-Nandivikramavarman who issued these plates may be identical with Vijya-Nandivarman III, the donor of the Velurpalaiyam plates. If the inscription were preserved in full, this question would not have been left to surmise and conjecture. The father of Vijaya-Nandivikramavarman is here stated to have been Hiranyavarman; while, the father of Vijaya-Nandivarman, according to the Velurpalaiyam plates, was Dantivarman. If the proposed identity of Vijaya-Nandivikramavarman with Vijaya-Nandivarman is accepted, the apparent discrepancy in the name of the father could be explained. The statement that Hiranyavarman â€œwas born *again*,â€? evidently indicates a second king of that name and we may suppose that Dantivarman, the father of Vijya-Nandivikramavaram, was also called Hiranyavarman like his grandfather Hiranyavarman I the father of Nandivarman Pallavamalla. If the foregoing surmises are confirmed by future researches, the Tandantottam grant would be 52 years later than the Velurpalaiyam plates of the same king.

The donees whose enumeration occupies more than eleven plates of the inscription number 244. They belong to various *gotras* and *sutras.* To judge from their titles (such as *chaturvedin, Trivedin, Somayajin, Vasantayajin, Shadangavid, Bhatta, Kramavid, Sarvakratuyajin, Dasapuriya*[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_2/no_99_tandanottam_plates_nandivikramavarman.html#_ftn5)*, Agnichit* and *Vajapeyin*) most of them must have been learned men as stated in verse 9. The largest number of shares assigned to a single individual is 12 and such a recipient was Attona-Shadangavi-Somayajin (No. 109) whose *gotra* and *sutra* are lost on one of the missing plates. The composer of the inscription, *viz.,* Uttarakaranika *alias* Ayyan Paramesvara of the Rathitara-*gotra* and Paviriya-*sutra* (No. 128) received two shares. Among the other donees, Tiruvadigal (evidently the name of the local Vishnu temple or of the Saiva devotees, as stated on page (41) of the introduction) got 5 shares while Mahadeva (the Siva temple) was assigned 2 shares.One share was allotted to the reciter of the *Bharata*; and the three (*madhyastha*) got one share each. A share was assigned for â€œpouring waterâ€? and for â€œlighting fireâ€? in arbitrators the hall (*ambalam*).
