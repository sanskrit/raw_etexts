SOUTH INDIAN INSCRIPTIONS

VOLUME XVI

**TELUGU INSCRIPTIONS OF THE VIJAYANAGARA DYNASTY**

**No. 76.**

**(A. R. No. 413 of 1919.)**

**Little Kanchipuram, Kanchipuram Taluk, Chingleput District.**

**On the south side of the rock in the Arulala-Perumal temple.**

**Krishnaraya, 1524 A.D.**

This record, in a single line, is dated **Saka 1446, Tarana, Margasirsha ba. 11, Monday, Sravana.** The Saka and cyclic year quoted correspond to **1524 A.D.** But the other details are irregular.

It records the gift of a pendant inset with precious stones by *Rayasam* Sripataya on behalf of the king.

The record also contains details of provisions made for offerings to the god while the deity camped at Kanchi for 36 days.

**No. 77.**

**(A. R. No. 326 of 1905.)**

**Upparapalle, Proddatur Taluk, Cuddapah District.**

**On a huge pillar lying in front of the Siva temple called Mobbuladevalam.**

**Krishnaraya, 1525 A.D.**

There are two dates in this record. The Sanskrit portion of the inscription contains a date in chronogram Ved-abdhi-yuga-\[bhu\*\], vrisha, Madhava (Vaisakha), Purnima. The composer of the verse has apparently omitted the word for the numerals in the chronogram which stands for Saka 1444 (current). The details correspond to 1521 A.D., April 21. The Telugu portion of the record contains another date Saka 1446, Tarana, Magha ba. 14, Monday, Sivaratri, corresponding to 1526 A.D., February 20, Monday, f.d.t., â€™21.

The inscription records that Pedasinga-mahipala or Pedasingama-nayaka, son of Jupalli Rama-nayaka, having gone on a casual visit to the temple of Naganatha and observed it in a state of ruins, undertook to have the temple renovated and so had the garbhagriha, ghamtavedi, antarala-mantapa, nandi-mantapa and the gopuras of the prakara built and a tank dug to the south of the temple. By the context of the record it seems that the former date cited above refers to the commencement of the renovation and the latter to the completion of the same The donor, who also endowed the temple with lands for a lamp, offerings and other services to the god, for the merit of his father, is said to have held the Chernuru and Potladurti-simas in Mulikinadu-sthala, situated in Ghamdikota-sima which was included in Udayagiri-rajya, as nayankara under the king.

The same pillar records the gift of two copper images of the god and the goddess by Malla-nayaka, brother of Pedasingama-nayaka besides a few other grants by the priests of the temple, and the masons who participated in the renovations.
