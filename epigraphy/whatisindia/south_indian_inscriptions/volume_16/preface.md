SOUTH INDIAN INSCRIPTIONS

VOLUME XVI

**TELUGU INSCRIPTIONS OF THE VIJAYANAGARA DYNASTY**

**PREFACE**

This volume of Telugu Inscriptions in the South Indian Inscription (Texts) Series edited by Sri H. K. Narasimhaswami, contains 335 epigraphs exclusively of the Vijayanagara kings collected between the years 1904 and 1928 in different parts of the former Madras Presidency.
It may be pointed out that Volume X of this series contains the records of all the other dynasties with the exception of those pertaining to the dynasties of the Vijayanagara, collected during the same period.

Some salient features of the more important records in the collection are briefly outlined in the introduction. It is hoped that this material will prove as rich a mine of information to scholars interested in the social, political, economic, literary and such other aspects of the period covered by these inscriptions, as to those interested in the history of the dynasties themselves.

The late Shri K. H. V. Sarma and Messrs. B. R. Gopal, V. S. Subrahmanyam and S. S. Ramachandramurthy has assisted in the preparation of this volume.
