SOUTH INDIAN INSCRIPTIONS

VOLUME XVI

**TELUGU INSCRIPTIONS OF THE VIJAYANAGARA DYNASTY**

**No. 26**

**(A. R. No. 255 of 1905.)**

**Tripurantakam, Karkapur Taluk, Kurnool District.**

**On a slab set up to the east of the Chikatimidde of the**

**Tripurantakesvara temple. Vijaya Bukka, 1423 A.D.**

This is dated in saka 1345, Sobhakrit, expressed by the chronogram **bana-yugaanala-indu, Pausha ba. 10 Monday** when the sun was entering **Mrigarasi**. The corresponding date would be **1423 A.D., December 27, Monday,** **â€™73**, if Mrigarasi stands for **Makara-rasi.**

This inscription in Sanskrit verse, states that when Vijaya Bukka, son of Devaraya was ruling over the kingdom from Vijayanagara, his minister Nagayamatya of Harita-*gotra*, son of Chaundapa and Srimayi, having worshipped God Tripurantaka and the goddess Tripurambika at Srisaila, bought a rice-field worth 300 *nikshkas* from Kumara Bhikshavritti and granted the same to the god. Nagayamatya is described as the foremost among the *Upapradhanas*. Mentions Ganamba as the donorâ€™s wife and Linganarya, son of Gangadharacharya, as the composer of the record.

**No. 27**

**(A. R. No. 125 of 1917.)**

**Paturu, Guntur Taluk, Guntur District.**

**On the Hanuman pillar set up in front of the Vishnu temple.**

**Devaraya II, 1423 A.D.**

The record is dated in Saka 1344, Sarvari, Phalguna su. 15, Thursday. Saka 1344, however, corresponds to Subhakrit. If Sarvari is a mistake for Subhakrit, the details regularly correspond to 1423 A.D., February 25.

It registers the grant of a piece of land in the village Pranturu towards the south of the river Krishna to Kondduri Ramanuja by prince Ramachandra, son of king Devaraya. The gift was made by Chenukali Kesava, the agent of the prince.

**No. 28**

**(A. R. No. 496 of 1906.)**

**Mopuru, Pulivendla Taluk, Cuddapah District.**

**On a slab lying behind the western gopura of the Bhairavesvara temple.**

**Kumara \[Kevaraya II\], 1425 A.D.**

This is dated Saka 1347, Visvavasu, Asvija su. 3, Sunday, corresponding to 1425 A.D., September 15, â€™14.

It records that Tirumalaraya, son of Gandaraguli, Boppadevani Virupanna, described as the nijabhritya of the king, had the gopura to the west of the temple of Bhairavadeva of Mrompuru constructed by his servant Vemula Tippi-nayaka, for the merit of his mothers Demayamma and Nagayamma and his sister Tirumaladevamma.

**No. 29**

**(A. R. No. 519 of 1906.)**

**Ulimella, Pulivendla Taluk, Cuddapah District.**

**On a slab set up in front of the Chennakesavasvamin temple.**

**Devaraya II, 1426 A.D.**

This is dated in the cyclic year Parabhava, Pushya ba. 1, Sunday. The cyclic year Parabhava, falling in the reign period of Devaraya II may be equated with Saka 1348, in which case the date corresponds to 1426 A.D., December 15.

This damaged inscription seems to record a gift of the village Ulimella to Chennakesavaperumal by Sambeta Bammayadeva-maharaju.

**No. 30.**

**(A. R. No. 371 of 1926.)**

**Tangeda, Palnad Taluk, Guntur District.**

**Ona slab set up in front of a dilapidated Siva temple.**

**Devaraya, \[1432\] A.D.**

The particulars of the date are lost.

It seems to refer to a gift of land to god Siva of Tangeda for the merit of the king. Also refers to another gift of land made to god Tripurantaka of Tangeda on Ashadha ba. 7 of the year Paridhavin. The year Paridhavin falling in Devaraya IIâ€™ reign corresponds to 1432 A.D.

**No. 31.**

**(A. R. No. 606 of 1907.)**

**Nandaluru, Rajampet Taluk, Cuddapah District.**

**On a slab set up near the inner gopura of the Saumyanathasvamin temple.**

**Devaraya II, 1433 A.D.**
