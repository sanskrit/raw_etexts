SOUTH INDIAN INSCRIPTIONS

VOLUME XVI

**TELUGU INSCRIPTIONS OF THE VIJAYANAGARA DYNASTY**

**INTRODUCTION**

The Telugu inscriptions of the Vijayanagara kings published in the present volume form but a small fraction of the innumerable epigraphic records pertaining to them not only in Telugu, but also in Tamil and Kannada, as the Vijayanagara Empire at its zenith comprised practically the entire tract covering these linguistic areas of Dekkan. Some of their inscriptions, especially their copper-plate charters, are also couched in Sanskrit. In this brief introduction only a few points of interest are outlined.

**The Sangama kings**

Inscriptions of the first or the Sangama Dynasty are conspicuously few. Indeed there is none of the first member of the family, viz., Harihara I, the eldest of the five brothers, or of Kampana, the next ruler. The earliest records (Nos. 1 to 3) presented in the volume belong to Savanna Odeya, son of Kampana by Mangadevi. Dated respectively in the Saka years 1273 (1351 A.D.), 1275 (1354 A.D.) and 1284 (1362 A.D.), they fall in the reigns of Harihara I and Bukka I.

Of the two epigraphs (Nos. 4 and 5) of Bukka I, No. 4, dated in Saka 1274 (1352) A.D.) describes him as *purva-paschima-samudradhipati* and as ruling from Dhorasamudra and Penugonda, probably under his elder brother Harihara I.

Harihara II. the son and successor of Bukka I, is represented by eight inscriptions (Nos. 6 â€“ 13) ranging in dates between Saka 1304 (1382 A.D.) and 1326 (1405 A.D.). One of them (No. 8) mentions Bhavadura Odeya as a *mahapradhana* of king Harihararaya. He may, in all probability, be identical with Bhaskara Bhavadura, son of Bukka I, who caused to be constructed the large tank called Anantarajasagara at Porumamilla in the Badvel Taluk, Cuddapah District.[](#_ftn1) It has been suggested that the term *Bhavadura* is but a varient of the Urdu word *Bahadur*.

Among the subordinates mentioned of Harihara, *Mahanayankacharya* Motta Dorappanayaka administering Balleganacheruvu in Mangumali-sthala under *Mahapradhana* Irugappa Dandanayaka who governed over Penugonda-Marjavada figures in No. 9 in the cyclic year Isvara corresponding to 1397 A.D. No. 11, dated in Saka 1325 (a mistake for 1323, Vrisha corresponding to 1401 A.D.) mentions Harihararaya, son of Vira Virupanna as ruling over Rayavaram. Neither Virupanna-Odeya (I), the brother of Harihara, nor Virupanna Odeya (II), the brother of Devaraya, is known to have had any sons. If Harihara of the record were a son of either of the Virupannas, he is hitherto unknown, unless he could be identified with Harihara III, the nephew of Virupaksha II, whom the former (Harihara) should have looked upon as his own father. A record from Srisailam (No. 12) gives a long string of epithets to the king such as *Pandyakulapratishthapanacharya, Cherakulasubhamkara, Cholanarapatirakshadikshavichakshana, Kudagakandakuddala, Konkanabhujanagajangalika, Kalingavangadhumaketu, Kambhojakamalaniharapata*, etc., some of which, it may be noted, could be recognized as those assumed by the Hoysala kings. The king is praised as *Rajavyasa* and *Rajavalmiki* and to have caused the *Vedabhashya* to be written, and supported the Saiva and Vaishnava creeds alike. He is besides credited to have driven away the Turushkas. The statement made in this epigraph regarding the *Vedabhashya* is corroborated by a copper-plate record dated 1386 A.D., which states that the king granted villages to scholars who helped the sage Vidyaranya in writing the commentaries on the *Vedas*.

Nos. 15 to 26 belongs to Devaraya I (called Vira-Devaraya), son of Harihara II and the younger brother and successor of Bukka II. Nos. 15 and 16 being dated Saka 1299 (1378 A.D.) and 1318 (1396 A.D.) respectively, belong to a period when he was still a subordinate under his father, and was ruling over Udayagiri-rajya. No. 21 refers to a representation made by the priests of the temple of Talakantidevi at Devigudi in the Cuddapah District, to the king on the occasion of his coronation and bears the date Saka 1328, Vyaya, lunar eclipse, corresponding to A.D. 1406, November 25. Obviously this is the date of made by the king whose date of coronation, according to his copper-plate grant the grant from Hassan fell on the 5^(th) November, exactly 20 days, earlier than the date of the inscription under reference. In No. 24, the king is called Chikkaraya Sri Vira Kumara Devaraya (of the family of) Vira Harihararaya (*Harihararayara Chikkaraya Sri Vira Kumara-Devaraya Maharayalu*). Among the dignitaries that served the king may be mentioned Birudaraju Lakkayyadeva-maharaju and Allalade va-maharaju who were ruling over Sakali and Peda-Koduru respectively; Peda Lakki-nayudu, Avubalinayudu and Balagopi-nayudu sons of *Mahanayankacharya* Kamu Dorapa-nayaka, perhaps different from his name sake who was also a *Mahanayankacharya* but had the family name Motta and served under Harihara ; Antappadandanayaka and Narasimhadeva-Vodeya, the ministers and Rachamareddi-Anavota-nayudu who held the *nayankara* of Inkollu.

The only record of Vijaya-Bukka (No. 26) is dated Saka 1345 (1423 A.D.) and mentions his minister Nagayamatya, son of Chaundapa and Srimayi and his gifts to the temple at Tripurantakam.

No. 27, the date of which also falls in 1423 A.D., mentions the prince Ramachandra as the son of Devaraya. An earlier record of this prince wherein he figures as ruling over Udayagiri-rajya is cited in the *Inscriptions in the Nellore District*, Kanigiri, No. 4, dated Saka 1338 (1416-17 A.D.).
