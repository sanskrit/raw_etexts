SOUTH INDIAN INSCRIPTIONS

VOLUME XVI

**TELUGU INSCRIPTIONS OF THE VIJAYANAGARA DYNASTY**

**No. 51.**

**(A. R. No. 569 of 1919.)**

**Little Kanchipuram, Kanchipuram Taluk, Chingleput District.**

**On the west wall of the second prakara in the Arulala-perumal temple.**

**Krishnaraya, 1514 A.D.**

This is dated **Saka 1436, Bhava, Jyeshtha su. 10, Wednesday,** corresponding to **1514 A.D., June 2, which was, however, Friday.**

The genealogy of the king is described at length in Sanskrit verse. It registers the gift of gold, copper, mercury and money to the temple treasury for gilding the Punyakoti-vimana of the temple of Perarulala-Perumal by the king for the merit of his parents Narasa-nayankodeyalu and Nagaji-amma and himself.

The Tamil version of this inscription is engraved on the north wall of the rock in this temple (No. 478 of 1919).

**No. 52.**

**(A. R. No. 18 of 1915.)**

**Srisailam, Nandikotkur Taluk, Kurnool District.**

**On stones built into the floor of the platform in the eastern porch of the Mallikarjuna temple. Krishnaraya, 1515 A.D.**

This is dated Saka 1438 (current), Yuva, Sravana su. 15, Wednesday, lunar eclipse, corresponding regularly to 1515 A.D., July 25.

The record is important for the historical information contained in it. The king, it is stated, started out from Vijayanagara on a campaign of conquest towards the east, conquered at a stretch Udayagiri, Addanki, Vinukonda, Bellamkonda, Nagarjunikonda, Tangedu, Ketavaram and other hill-forts and land-forts and captured Tirumala Kataraya-mahapatra. Having taken Kondavidu, he captured alive Virabhadraraya, Naraharideva, Rachuri Mallu-khanu, Uddanda-khanu, Jannala-Kasavapatra, Pusapati Rachiraju, Srinatharaju, Lakshmipatiraju, Paschima-Balachandra-Mahapatra and others. Later he reinstated the captives in their places, visited Amaresvara at Dharanikota and performed the Tulapurusha ceremony in the presence of the god on the banks of the river Krishnaveni. He had the Ratnadhenu and Sapta-sagara mahadanas performed by his queens Chinnadevi and Tirumaladevi respectively. Finally he visited Sriparvata, where he had the mandapa built in the car-street of the temple. The epigraph refers to the gift of the villages Paramanchala and Atukuru formerly made to the god of the place in the year Srimukha. It also mentions the remission of levies on loads (Kanchi-kavadi), pack-horses, bullocks, asses and head-loads.

The details of the date given for the said Srimukha viz., Vaisakha su. 11 and Thursday do not agree for the year. But they work-out correctly for the previous year Bhava. Hence assuming the cyclic year to be a mistake for Bhava, the date would correspond to 1514 A.D., May 4.
