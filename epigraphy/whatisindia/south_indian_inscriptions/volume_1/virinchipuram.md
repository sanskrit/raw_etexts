**III.-INSCRIPTIONS AT AND NEAR VIRICHIPURAM**

**NO.56. INSIDE THE FRONT GOPURA OF THE VIRINCHIPURAM TEMPLE, SECOND INSCRIPTION TO THE RIGHT**

This inscription is dated during the reign of Virapratapa-Devaraya-maharaja (of Vijayanagara) and in the *Visvavasu* year, which was current after the expiration of the Saka year 1347. It refers to q question of the sacred law *(dharma)* of the *Brahmanas*, which was settled by the Brahmanas of the kingdom of Padaividu, among whom Karnata, Tamir, Telugu and Lata *Brahmanas* are mentioned. Their representatives signed an agreement to the effect, that henceforth marriages among their families had only to be concluded by *kayadana,* i.e., that the father had to give his daughter to the bridegroom gratuitously. Both the father who accepted money, and the bridegroom who paid money for the bride, should be subject to punishment by the king and to excommunication for their caste. This practice was evidently adopted on the authority of the canonical works on sacred law, which condemn in strong terms the payment of money for the bride, and use the term *asura-vivadha* for a marriage thus concluded. The four forms of marriage permitted to *Brahmanas* are mere varieties of the marriage by *kanyadhana.*

To the end of the inscription a large number of signatures of *Brahmans* are attached. This part of the original is obliterated to such an extent that a satisfactory transcript cannot be given. In some cases, the places where the single *Brahmanas* came from, are registered. As the identification of these localities might be useful for fixing the extent of the kingdom of Padaividu, I subjoin those which may be read with certainty: Kalanjiyam,Kamalapadam, Marudam, Mangalam, Araiyapadi, Kannamangalam[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/virinchipuram.html#_ftn1) A\[ga\]tterippattu, Enadapadi. Two other inscriptions mention Gudiyattam[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/virinchipuram.html#_ftn2) and Vallam[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/virinchipuram.html#_ftn3) as belonging to the kingdom of Padavidu[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/virinchipuram.html#_ftn4) or Padavedu. The kingdom of Padaividu (*Padaivittu rajyam)* was called after the town of Padaividu, now Padavedu in the Polur Talluqa of the North Arcot District. According to two Vijayanagara inscriptions, it formed a district of Tondai-mandalam[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/virinchipuram.html#_ftn5). The name Padaividu means â€œan encampmentâ€? and seems to owe its origin to a temporary camp of some king, around which a city arose in course of time[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/virinchipuram.html#_ftn6)

Let there be Prosperity! Hail! On the day of *(the nakshatra)* *Anusham[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/virinchipuram.html#_ftn7)* which corresponds to Wednesday, the sixth lunar day, the 3^(rd) (*solar day)* of the month of *Panguni[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/virinchipuram.html#_ftn8)* of the *Visvavasu* year, which was current after the Saka year 1347 (*had passed),* while the illustrious *maharajadhiraja-parameswara,* the illustrious Virapratpa-Devaraya-maharaja was pleased to rule the earth,-the great men of all branches of sacred studies of the kingdom *(rajyam)* of Padaividu drew up, in the presence of (*the god)* Gopinatha (*of)* Arkapushkkarini, a document (*which contains)* an agreement fixing the sacred law. According to (*this document),* if the *Brahmanas* of this kingdom (*rajyam)* of Padaividu, *viz.,* Kannadigas, Tamiras, Telungas, Ilalas,[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/virinchipuram.html#_ftn9)etc.,of all *gotras*, *sutras,* and *sakhas* conclude a marriage, they shall, from this day forward, do it by *kanyadana.* Those who do no adopt *kanyadana,* i.e., both those who give away after having received gold, and those who conclude a marriage after having given gold, shall be liable to punishment by the king and shall be excluded from the community of *Brahmanas.* These are the contents of the document which was drawn up.

The following are the signatures of the great men of all branches of sacred studies:-

**NO.57. ON A STONE BUILT INTO THE FLOOR OF THE COURTYYARD OF THE VIRINCHIPURAM TEMPLE**

This inscription records that in the *Saumya* year, which was current after the expiration of Saka 1471, the pavement of the outer courtyard of the Virincipuram Temple was laid by Bommuu-nayaka, who is evidently the same person as Sinua-Bommu-nayaka or Bomma-nripati of Velur[\[10\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/virinchipuram.html#_ftn10). On this occasion, the other inscribed stones which are noticed in part III, must have found their way into the floor of the temple.

TRANSLATION

Let there be prosperity! On Thursday, the day of (*the nakshtra)* *Punarvasu,* which corresponds to the seventh lunar day of the former half of the month of *Mesha* of the *Saumya* year, which was current after the Salivaha-Saka year 1471 (*had passed),*-in order to procure religious merit to Machcha (?)-nayaka (*of)* Velur,-prince Bommu-nayaka laid the pavement round the whole *(temple).*

Ananda-Namasivaya-pandaram. The grant was made at the margasahayesvara Temple of Tiru-Virinchapuram (*Virinchipuram).*

**TRANSLATION**

Hail! On the 6^(th) solar day of the month of *Tai* of the *Nadana* year, which was current after the Saka year 1514 (*had passed),* while the illustrious *mahamandalesvara,* the hero (*Ganda)* the dagger (*Kattari),* the hawk *(Saluva)*, the illustrious Venkatapati-deva-maharayar was pleased to rule the earth, -in the presence of (*the god)* Margasahayesvara (*of)* Tiru-Viranchapuram,-Periya-Erama-nayaka (*of)* Punnarrur ordered a house (*manai)* on the northern side of the holy street (*tiru-vithi)* of Vandarayan (*to be given for)* a *matha* to Anada-Namasivaya-pandaram, the worshipper (*i.e.*pupil?) of the *guru* Namasivaya-murti (*of)* Chidambarma, in order to procure religious merit to Samkarappa-nayaka Ayan, the son of Maya*(?)-*nayaka(*of)* Velur. This house for the *matha* consists of 1 house to the east of the house of Trayambaka and
to the west of the house of Murti-manikkam, and of a house-garden of 41 feet. To this meritorious gift of a *mahta* we gave, with a libation o water, for each day a

*kuruni[\[12\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/virinchipuram.html#_ftn12)* of rice (?

Whose ever injures this meritorious gift of a *matha,* that man shall incur the sin of one who has killed a black cow on the bank of the Ganga.

**INSCRIPTIONS OF THE PERUMAL TEMPLE AT POYGAI NEAR VIRINCHIPURAM**

These inscriptions (Nos.59 to 64) are dated during the reign of a king called *Tribhuvanachakravartin* Rajaraja-deva. His twenty-second year corresponded to Saka 1160 (Nos.59 and 60), his twenty-fourth year to Saka 1161 (Nos.61 and 62) and his twenty-eighth year was current after the expiration of Saka 1165 (No.64). Accordingly, the first year of his reign corresponded to the Saka year 1137-38.

The inscription record that the Kerala merchant Adi-Rama, an inhabitant of â€œthe Hill-country,â€? i.e., of Malayalam, granted three villages, which he had bought from a certain Sambuvarayan, to the temple, on the walls of which the inscriptions are found. The temple had two names:1.Arulala-Perumal of Poygai *alias* Rajendra-Chola-nallur, and 2.Chitra-meri-Malai-mandala-Vinnagara. The technical meaning of *chitra-meri,* â€œthe beautiful plough-tail,â€? is not clear. The remainder of the second name means â€œthe Vishnu temple[\[15\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/virinchipuram.html#_ftn15) of the Hill-country.â€? Probably the donor Rama himself had founded the temple and called it after his native country, viz., Malayalam.

The full name of Sambuvarayan, from whom Rama bought the three villages which he granted to the Poygai Temple, was Sengeni-Virasani[\[16\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/virinchipuram.html#_ftn16)-Ammaiappan (*or* Ammaiyappan) Aragiya-Soran, *alias*
Edirilli[\[17\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/virinchipuram.html#_ftn17)-Sora-Sambuvarayan[\[18\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/virinchipuram.html#_ftn18). He seems to have been a vassal of Rajaraja-deva.

The Palaru is the well-known Palar, the chief river of the North Arcot District.

**No.65. ON THE WEST AND SOUTH WALLS OF THE ISVARA TEMPLE AT VAKKANAPURAM NEAR VIRINCHIPURAM**

This inscription records, that a number of people agreed to found a temple, called Okkaninra-nayanar, and granted to it three *velis[\[25\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/virinchipuram.html#_ftn25)*of land belonging to Tiru-Virunchapuram, *i.e.,* Virinchipuram, and a *tirumadaivilagam.[\[26\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/virinchipuram.html#_ftn26)* Okkaninra-nayanar ws evidently the name of the Vakkanapuram Temple, and may be connected wit hthe modern name of the village. A shrine of Chandesvara-nayanar,[\[27\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/virinchipuram.html#_ftn27)the god, who issupposed to preside over the temple treasure, seems to have been attached to the temple.

Further, some land was granted to Varittunai-nayanar, â€œthe lord who is a companion on the road .â€? This is the Tamil equivalent of Margasahayesvara, the name of the Virinchipuram Temple, which occurs in No.58.

The whole grant was entrusted to a certain Kambavna-bhatta, whose name also appears among the signatures, which are attached to this document.
Among these there are some curious denominations, which show that the villagers were fond of bearing royal names. Thus we find Vira-Sora-Brahma-rayan, Minavarayan[\[28\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/virinchipuram.html#_ftn28) Devarayan, Nandivarman, Muvendirayan[\[29\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/virinchipuram.html#_ftn29) and Chedirayan. One of the witnesses signs half in Tamil half in Sanskrit; another was called after Sirrambalam and a third hailed from Periya-nadu.

**TRANSLATIION**

Let there be prosperity! According to the pleasure of Chandesvara-nayanar, (*the following gifts were made over)* to Arvar Kambavana-bhatta.

From the month of *Karttika* of the *Siddharthin* year forward, the lord Okkaninra-nayanar shall be placed in the dry land to the south of the Devaneri (*tank), (which belongs)* to the dry land of Tiru-Viunchapuram, the Okkaninran-eri (*tank)* shall be constructed, and the reclaimable land below this tank and in other places, which are above the level of this water, shall be reclaimed. After they are reclaimed, three *velies* of land below this tank shall be placed at the disposal of this lord Okkaninra-nayanar as a divine gift, as a *saravamanya (and)* from taxes, to last as long as the moon and the sum. With the exception of these three *velis* of land, the elevated land shall be a dive gift to the lord Varittunai-nayanar. (*All the land)* which pays taxes,-including the door-money (*vasalpanam),* which will be taken from all houses built round and in front of the holy temple of this Okkaninra-nayanar,-shall belong to this Okkaninra-nayanar as the environs of his temple (*tirumadavilagam),* which shall be a *saravamanya* (*and)* free from (other) taxes. One *kalam[\[30\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/virinchipuram.html#_ftn30)* and four *naris[\[31\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/virinchipuram.html#_ftn31)* of paddy and a quarter *panam* shall be taken, including all conditions (*?Upadhi),* per hundred *kuris* of the elevated land, which is reclaimed, in the year during which it is reclaimed, with the exception of those environs of the temple and the three *velis* of land, (*which form)* that divine gift. \[the meaning of the next three clauses, which contain some unintelligible terms, seems to be, that in the next-following year, one quarter, in the next, one half, and in each further year, three quarters more than in the first year should be taken.\] A document to this effect shall be engraved on the holy mountain (*tirumalai)[\[32\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/virinchipuram.html#_ftn32)* Let the blessed Mahesvesvara protect this (*gift).*

This is the signature of the magistrate (*adhikaram)* Ilakkappan. This is the signature of Kambavana-bhatta. This is (*the signature)* of Dakshinamurti-bhatta. This is the signature of Tiruchchirrambala-bhatta. This is the signature of Appar-andi. This is the signature of Sama-Brahma-rayan. This is the signature of the illustrious Mahesvara-vearan.

[\[22\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/virinchipuram.html#_ftnref22) *Pallichchendam* probably means â€œtemple-landâ€? just as *palli-gramam* â€œa village belongs to a temple.â€?
