**PART-III**

**NOTES AND FRAGMENTS**

**IV. IN THE GOPURA AT TIRUMALAI NEAR POLUR**

**No.141. INSIDE THE GOPURA AT TIRUMALAI NEAR POLUR, ON THE BASE**[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/tirumalai.html#_ftn1)

The inscription is a fragment, dated in some year of Rajaraja-deva[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/tirumalai.html#_ftn2).
In the second line the word Sora-kon. â€œthe Chola king,â€? occurs.

**No.142. ON THE BASE OF THE SOUTH WALL OF THE AMMAIAPPESVARA TEMPLE AT PADAVEDU**

The beginning of both lines of this inscription is buried underground.
From that part, which I have copied, it appears that the inscription refers to some gift (*manya,* i.e., *sarvamanya).* At the beginning of the second line, the word *padaividu* occurs in the plural and seems to be used in the sense of â€œencampments.â€? The inscription ends with â€œthe signature of Jayankonda-Sora-Brahma-rayanâ€?; the same name is borne by a village-accountant in a Tirumalai inscription.

**No.143. ON THE NORTH WALL OF THE SOMANATHESVARA TEMPLE AT PADAVEDU**

This inscription is an incorrect duplicate of the first four lines of No.81, above.
