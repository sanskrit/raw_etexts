**SANSKRIT INSCRIPTIONS**

**Round the shrine of Rajasimhesvara**

**TRANSLATION**

*(Verse 1).* May *(Ganga)* purify you ! â€“ she who springs from the jewel *(on the head)* of Sthanu *(Siva),* appearing. . . . . black by the splendour of *(his)* neck and red by the rays of the gems on the hoods *(of his snkes),* who fills the lake of the three worldsâ€¦..

(2.)â€¦..After him *(there was)* that sage Angiras, who was born from his (viz., *Brahmanâ€™s)* mind. His son was *(Brihaspati)* the minister of Sakra (*Indra)* and preceptor of the gods. His son was Samyu. From him, who possessed terrible power and was honoured in the three worlds, there took birth that illustrious chief of sages, Bharadvaja by name, who became the source of the race of the Pallavas.

(3.) From this lovely one came Drona, the highly honoured preceptor of the Pandavas *(and)* Kurus ; from him the great Asvatthaman, who deprived princes of their constancy and pride. Just as the first-born Manu, his son, Pallava by name, became the founder of a race of brave and victorious kings, who enjoyed the whole earth :-

(4.) Of the Pallava princes, who were pious, who destroyed the excessively great pride of the *Kali (age)*, who spoke the truth, who were profound, whose minds knew how to practice the *trivarga,* who assiduously honoured the aged, who forcibly subdued lust and the other internal foes, who excelled in the knowledge of weapons, who were firm, mighty and endowed with polity and modesty.

(5.) Just as Guha (*also called* Subrahmanya *or* Kumara) took birth from the supreme lord *(Siva),* the destroyer of the warlike *(demon)* Pura, thus from the supreme lord Ugradanda, [\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/rajasimhesvara.html#_ftn1) who was born in the race of these (viz., *the Pallavas)* the destroyer of the city of Ranarasika, there took birth a very pious prince *(Subrahmanyah Kumarah),* the illustrious Atyantakama,[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/rajasimhesvara.html#_ftn2) the chief of the Pallavas, who crushed the multitude of his foes by his power (or spear), whose great statesmanship was well-known[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/rajasimhesvara.html#_ftn3) and who had got rid of all impurity *(by walking)* on the path of the Saiva doctrine.

(6.) Like Manmatha *(Kama),* he charmed refined women in secret ; like Vasava *(Indra),* he constantly protected those, who frequented the path of the three *Vedas ;* like Madhva (*Vishnu)*, he tore the hearts of the enemies of sages, twice-born and gods ; and like Vittada *(kuvera),* he gratified good people with abundant wealth.

(7.) If in the *Krita (age)* kings like Dushyanta, who saw the gods and were engaged by *(Saints)* like Kanva, would hear a heavenly voice without body, that is not a matter of wonder ; but ah ! this is extremely astonishing, that Sribhara[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/rajasimhesvara.html#_ftn4) has heard that voice in the *Kali* age, from which good qualities keep aloof.

(8.) May Ranajaya [\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/rajasimhesvara.html#_ftn5) be victorious for a long time, who humbled those princes, who were puffed up with the pride of abundant prosperity, which they had acquired by polity and prowess, depriving them of their intelligence in the mere space of knitting his brows, and who, like Purushottama *(Vishnu)* , was born to recue from the ocean of sin the sinking people, who were swallowed by the horrid monster, *(called)* the *Kali* age !

(9.) While this prince enjoyed the whole world, which he had conquered by valour combined with polity, and in which he had killed rebels and humbled kings, he erected this extensive and wonderful house of Hara *(siva),* which resembles his fame and the laughter of
Hara.[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/rajasimhesvara.html#_ftn6)

(10.) May Samkara *(Siva,)* whose terrible ornaments are the coils of the kind of serpents, and who is praised by the hosts of the kings of gods and of demons, reside for a long time in this temple, *(Called)* the holy Rajasimha-Pallavesvara !

(11.) May the bull-marked *(Siva)* always lend his presence to this temple of stone, called Rajasimhesvara, which touches the clouds with its top, which robs Kailasa of its beauty, and which was built by that pious king of Kings, who made all quarters obedient to his orders and *(who proved)* a royal lion (*Rajasimha)* to the dense troops of the elephants of his daring foes !

(12.) May Rajasimha, the conqueror in battle (*Ranajaya),* the bearer of prosperity *(Sribhara)*, the wonderful archer *(Chitrakarmukha),[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/rajasimhesvara.html#_ftn7)* the unrivalled hero *(Ekavira),* who has Siva for his crest-jewel (*Sivachudamam),[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/rajasimhesvara.html#_ftn8)*
for a long time protect the earth !

**No.31. A PALLAVA INSCRIPTION IN A CAVE-TEMPLE NEAR PANAMALAI**[\[21\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/rajasimhesvara.html#_ftn21)

A facsimile of this inscription was kindly forwarded to me by Mr. Raghavendracharya of Vanur. It consists of one Sanskrit verse, which is identical with the last verse of Rajasimhaâ€™s large inscription at Kanchi (No.24, above). Hence it may be concluded, that the Panamalai Cave was founded by Rajasimha and that in his time the Pallava ruled as far south as Panamalai.

**No.32. A PALLAVA INSCRIPTION FROM AMARAVATI**[\[22\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/rajasimhesvara.html#_ftn22)

The subjoined Sanskrit inscription is engraved on three sides of an octagonal pillar,[\[23\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/rajasimhesvara.html#_ftn23) which was excavated at Amaravati by Mr. R. Sewell and sent by dr. Burgess to the Madras Museum. The top of the pillar and some letters of the uppermost lines of the inscription have broken off. The inscription has hitherto remained a puzzle, as each line seems to end incomplete.
Finding, that the first words of some lines were connected with the last words of the following lines, I was led to suppose that the inscription must begin from the bottom and not from the top. Curiously enough, this is really the case. If the inscription is read upwards, we find that it consists of eleven complete verses and of a prose, passage, the end of which is lost through the mutilation of the pillar at the top.

\>

The inscription opens with an invocation of Buddha and with a mythical genealogy of Pallava, the supposed founder of the Pallava dynasty.

**Brahman**

**\|**

**Bharadvaja**

**\|**

**Sudhaman**

**\|**

**Drona**

**\|**

**Asvatthama, married to the Apsaras Madani**

**\|**

**Pallava**

Verse 8 gives a popular etymology of the name Pallava. Then there follow the names of seven Pallava kings : -

**1.Mahendravarman, Son of Pallava.**

**2.Simhavarman I., Son of 1.**

**3.Arkavarman, Son of 2.**

**4.Ugravarman.**

**6.Nandivarman, Son of 5, Sri-Simhavishnu.**

**7.Simhavarman II.**

The inscription contains no information about the relationship, which existed between 3 and 4, 4 and 5, 6 and 7. Neither does the genealogy agree with the lists derived by Mr. Foulkes[\[24\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/rajasimhesvara.html#_ftn24) and Mr. Fleet [\[25\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/rajasimhesvara.html#_ftn25) from other Pallava inscriptions, although similar names of kings occur in them. For these reasons great care should be taken in using the above list for historical purpose.

From the incomplete prose passage at the end of the inscription, we learn that, on his return from an expedition to the north, Simhavarman II. Came to a place sacred to lost part of the pillar must have recorded a donation, which the king made to Buddha.

Dhanyaghata or Dhanyagataka is evidently identical with Dhanyakata or Dhanyakataka, â€œcorn-townâ€? the well-known old name of Amaravati. The use of *gha* instead of *ka* can perhaps be explained by the Tamil habit of softening a single consonant between two words.â€™

**TRANSLATION**

(Verse 1.) May the dust of the glorious,[\[26\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/rajasimhesvara.html#_ftn26) feet of Bhavadvish,[\[27\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/rajasimhesvara.html#_ftn27)
which thickly covers[\[28\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/rajasimhesvara.html#_ftn28) the multitude of brilliant crest-jewels of the lords of gods and of demons, for a long time show you (*the way to)* supreme glory !

(2.) From the first creator (*Brahman)* there sprang a pure sage, called Bharadvaja, who mastered the *srutis ;* from him ocean (*uniting)* the rivers of speech, Angiras by name ; from his the renowned sage Sudhaman ;

(3.) From him a sage called Drona, who thoroughly knew all *agamas* and who possessed terrible might. In order to obtain a son who would found a race, he strove to please the eight-formed (*Siva)* by austerities.

(4.) By the favour of Sambhu, there arose to him a brilliant (*son),* famed by the name of Asvatthaman, just as at morn the brilliant sun rises over the eastern mountain.

(5.) Once, surrounded by (*other)* celestial maidens, the famous nymph Madani, who wished to see the abode of the hermits, entered the path of sight of that ascetic.

(6.) The saint approached her, while, seated amongst a group of *asoka*-trees, she was wistfully regarding the male swans, which were afraid of being separated from their beloved ones, whenever they lost sight of them behind a lotus of the lake, which was agitated by the wind.

(7.) Perceiving him who resembled Cupid in the dress of a saint, she lost her self-control, just as Uma on seeing Sarva. Then the nymphs united the couple, which had conceived a deep affection (*towards each other)*

(8.) In due time, the nymph gave birth to a protector of the earth, which is girt by the ocean. The father called his son Pallava, as he was lying on a couch *(covered)* with a heap of sprouts (*pallava).*

(9.) From him came the ruler of the earth Mahendravarman ; from him the valiant Simhavarman ; from him Arkavarman ; after him Ugravarman ; then Nandivarman from Sri-Simhavishnu.

(10.) There arose that Simhavarman, in whose audience-hall darkness is transformed into dawn by the splendour of the jewels on the heads of many princes, and whom people call (*the lord)* of eighteen *lakshas* of horses and elephants.

(11.) This hero for along time protected the earth, whose garment in the ocean, whose pearl-necklace is the Ganga, and whose earnings are Meru and Mandara.

(Line 28.) Once, while his back, his flanks and his front were guarded by all his brave vassals and tributaries *(mandalika-samanta),* he marched to the peak of Sumeru, in order to place (*there)* the fame, which he had acquired by conquering all quarters.[\[29\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/rajasimhesvara.html#_ftn29)
His elephants, which resembled the peaks of the mountain of the gods (*Meru)*, tore with claws (!) of their feet the gold,[\[30\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/rajasimhesvara.html#_ftn30) and his horse, walking on those pieces *(of gold)*, made the sky appear like a canopy by the gold-dust rising under their hoofs. There, in order to remove the fatigue caused by wandering over the whole world, he passed a few days, enjoying the shade of the *(Ganga),* the Godavari and the Krishnaverna ,[\[31\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/rajasimhesvara.html#_ftn31) he perceived (*a place sacred to)* the lord Vitaraga (*Buddha)*, named the illustrious town of Dhanyaghata. Having regarded it with curiosity, and having humbly aproached and saluted the tutelar deities, which were charged with the protection of the whole sacred place *(kshetra),* he listened to a discourse on the law[\[32\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/rajasimhesvara.html#_ftn32) . . . in a secluded spot. Having heard it, saluted the highest-born[\[33\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/rajasimhesvara.html#_ftn33) . . . and spoke thus : â€œI also, O lord ! (*shall erect a statue?)* of the lord at this very place, ornamented with jewels, gold, and silver.â€? After he had thus spoken, the lord said : â€œWell, well, lay-worshipper Simhavarman ! Here \[ *at \]* the place sacred to the highest Buddhaâ€¦â€? Then having saluted . . . in Dhanyaghataka. . .

**Nos. 33 AND 34. TWO CAVE-INSCRIPTIONS FROM THE TRISIRAPALLI ROCK**[\[34\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/rajasimhesvara.html#_ftn34)

The subjoined inscriptions are engraved on two pillars in a rock-cut cave not far from the summit of the well-known rock at Trisirapalli (*Trichiropoly).* They are both somewhat worn. The left pillar was found covered by a modern wall, which the temple-authorities temporarily removed at the request of the collector, W. A. Willock, C.S. On each of the two pillars are four Sanskrit verses. Besides, the lower part of the left pillar bears a few unintelligible Sanskrit words and a much defaced inscription in old Tamil characters.

The two inscriptions record, that a king Gunabhara, who bore the *birudas* Purushotama, Satrumalla and Satyasamdha, constructed a temple of Siva on the top of the mountain and placed in it a *linga* and a statue of himself. Each of the two pillars mentions the river Kaveri, i.e., the Kaveri, on whose banks Trisirapalli is situated, and referes to the Chola country. On the left pillar the Kaviri is called â€˜the beloved of Pallavaâ€™ ; this means in prose that a Pallava king ruled over the country along the banks of the Kaveri river. This allusion and the fact, that t he characters of the two pillar inscriptions remind us of those of the Pallava inscriptions at Mamallapuram and Kanchipuram, make it very probable that Gunabhara was a Pallava prince, who rulld the Chola country.

**TRANSLATION**

(Verse 1.) Being afraid, that the god who is fond of rivers (*Siva),* having perceived the Kaviri, whose waters please the eye, who wears a garland of gardens, and who possesses lovely qualities, might fall in love *(with her)*, the daughter of the mountain *(Parvati)* has, I think, left her fatherâ€™s family and resides permanently on this mountain, calling this river the beloved of the Pallava (k*ing).[\[35\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/rajasimhesvara.html#_ftn35)*

(2.) While the king called Gunabhara is a worshipper of the *linga*, let the knowledge, which has turned back from hostile *(vipaksha)* conduct, be spread for a long time in the world by this *linga \![\[36\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/rajasimhesvara.html#_ftn36)*

(3.) This mountain resembles the diadem of the Chola province, this temple of Hara (*Siva)* its chief jewel, and the splendour of Samkara *(Siva)* its splendour.

(4.) By the stone-chisel a material body of Satyasamdha was executed,[\[37\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/rajasimhesvara.html#_ftn37) and by the same an eternal body of his fame was produced.

**TRANSLATION**

(Verse 1.) When king Gunabhara placed a stone-figure in the wonderful stone-temple on the top of the best of mountains, he made in this way[\[38\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/rajasimhesvara.html#_ftn38)
Sthanu (*Siva)* stationary[\[39\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/rajasimhesvara.html#_ftn39) and became himself stationary (i.e.*immortal)* in the worlds together with him.

(2.) King Satrumalla built on this mountain a temple of Girisha (*Siva),* the husband of the daughter of the king of mountains, in order to make he name Girisha (i.e. *the mountain dweller)* true to its meaning.

(3.) After Hara *(Siva)* had graciously asked him : â€œHow could I, standing in a temple on earth, view the great power of the Cholas or the river Kaviri ?â€? â€“ king Gunabhara, who resembled Manu in his manner of rulling, assigned to him this mountain-temple, which touches the clouds.
