** II. INSCRIPTIONS AT VIJYANAGARA**

**No.153. ON A JAINA TEMPLE AT VIJAYANAGARA**

Next to No.152, this is the oldest dated inscription at Vijayanagara, It is engraved on both sides of the north-west entrance of ruined Jaina temple, which is situated to the south-west of the temple No.35, on the *Madras Survey Map.* A careless transcript and paraphrase in the *Asiatic Researches* has been useful so far as it enables Mr. R. Sewell to complete the pedigree of the first Vijayanagara dynasty in his *Lists of Anitiquities.*

The inscription is written in large and handsome characters, which are, however, considerably obliterated in consequences of the useful coating with chunnam. It records, in Sanskrit, prose and verse, that in the *Parabhava* year, which was current after the expiration of the Saka year 1348 (line 25), king Devaraja II. built a stone-temple (*chaityalaya* or *chaityagara)* of the *Arhat* Parsvantha (1.5)or Parsva-Jinesvara (1.27) in a street (*vithi)* of the Pan-supari Bazar (*Kramuka-paranapana,* 1.4 or Parna-pugiphalapana, 1.25) at his residence Vijayangara (1.4) or vijayanagari (1.6), which belonged to the Karnata country (11.4 and 6).

The chief value of the inscription consists in the pedigree, which it gives no less than three times, of the first Vijayangara dynasty:-

1.Bukka (11.1,9,24) of the race of Yadu (*Yadu-kula, 1.8, or yadavanvaya , 1.1)*

2.His son, Harihara (II.) (11,2,10,24) , *maharaja (1.2).*

3.His son, Devaraja (I.) (11, 2 ,13,24), *maharaja (1.2).*

4.His son, Vijaya (II.13,15,16,19,20,24) or Vira-Vijaya (1.2)

5.His son, Devaraja (II.) (II, 15,18,19,20,22,24), Abhinava-Devaraja (11.3f.), or Vira-Devaraja (1.16), *maharaja* (1.4), *rajadhiraja, rajaparamesvara,* etc. (11.3 and 23).

**VIJAYANAGARA INSCRIPTION OF DEVARAJA II**

In the subjoined genealogical table of the first or Yadava dynasty of Vijayanagara, the names of the father and of the elder brother of Bukka and those Saka dates, for which no references are given in the foot-notes, are taken from Mr.Fleetâ€™s table of the same dynasty.

During the reign of Devaraja II. thecity of Vijayanagara was wvisited By â€˜Abduâ€™r-razzaq as an ambassador of Sultan Shah Rukh of Samarkand, a son of the great Timur. â€˜Abduâ€™r-razzaq informs us, that he stayed at Bijanagar (Vijayanagara), the capital of Deo Rai (Devaraja II.), from the close of Z*uâ€™l-hijja* A.H. 846 = end of April A.D. 1443 to the 12^(th) *Shaâ€˜bdin* A.H. 847 = 5^(th) December A.D. 1443.[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/jaina.html#_ftn1) An English translation of his own account of his journey is included in Elliot and Dowsonâ€™s *History of India.* Curiously the *Thousand and one Nights*, where it forms part of the *Story of Prince Ahmed and the Fairy Pari Banu.* This is one of the twelve doubtful stories, the originals of which are not found in the existing Arabic MSS. of the *Nights.* The late Professor Weil was of opinion, that they were probably contained in the fourth, volume of the Paris MS., which was lost after Gallandâ€™s death; and two of the missing stories have since been actually recovered by M.Zotenberg. In â€˜Abuâ€™r-razzaqâ€™s account of Vijayanagara, we possess the dated original, from which part of the *Story of Prince Ahmad* was taken. In the absence of works of reference, I cannot say if this fact,-which furnishes us with a *terminus a quo* for the compilation of that story,-has been notices before.

According to â€˜Abuâ€™r-razzaq, Devaraja II, issued the following coins:-I. Gold: (1) *vardha;*(2)*partab=Â½ Varaha;*(3)*fanam= 1/10 partab.* II. Silver:*tar=1/6 fanam. III. Copper:Jital=1/3 tar.* Pagodas or *vardhas* with the legend , which on some copies is corrupted into , are described by dr. Bidie, who also figures a pagoda of Bukka. The name *partab,* which â€˜Abduâ€™r-razzaq attributes to the half pagoda, is probably connected with the surname Pratapa, which occurs before the namesof Vijayanagara kings both on coins and in inscriptions. Dr. Bain of Bangalore possesses a half pagoda with the legend (*sic*) and of the sake type as the corresponding pagoda. Two quarter pagodas in my cabinet have on the obverse an elephant which faces the left, and on the reverse the legend \*\*\*. No *fanam* or silver coin with Devarajaâ€™s name has been hitherto discovered. Copper coins of Devaraja are very common in the South-Indian *bazaars.* They have on the obverse a bull or an elephant, and on the reverse the legends \*\*\*, \*\*\*, \*\*\* , or \*\*\*

**TRANSLATION**

Let there be prosperity ! (*Verse* 1.) May the religion of the lord of three worlds, the religion of Jina, the unfailing characteristic of which is the glorious and extremely mysterious scepticism, be victorious !
*(Line 1.).* The victorious and illustrious prince Vira-Vijaya sprang from the brave prince Devaraja (I.), who resembled the king of the gods and who was descended in his turn from the glorious *majharaja* Harihara (II), whose body was produced by the results of the good deeds of the illustrious kind Bukka, who, just as the full-moon from the ocean, (*rose)* from the illustrious Yadava race *(Yadavanvaya).* The virtuous *maharaja* Abhinava Devaraja (*i.e.,* the young Devearaja, or Devaraja II, (*who sprang) from this* (Vira Vijaya), just as a heap of large rubies from the Rohan mountain,[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/jaina.html#_ftn2) who made the throne
