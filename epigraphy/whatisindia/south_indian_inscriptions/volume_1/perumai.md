**TAMIL AND GRANTHA INSCRIPTIONS**

**II. INSCRIPTIONS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF VELUR**

**NO.49. ON A STONE AT PERUMAI NEAR VELUR**

The object of the grant is the village of Perumugai (?), i.e., the modern Perumai

**NO.50. ON A STONE AT SEKKANUR NEAR VELUR**

This inscription records the gift of the village of Sekkanur to the Vellore Temple

**TRANSLATION**

Let there be prosperity! The village of Sekkanur was given for (*the requirements of)* daily worship to (*the temple of*) Jvarakandesvara-svamin (at) Velur. Let there be prosperity!

**NO.51. ON A ROCK ON THE TOP OF THE BAVAJI HILLNEAR VELUR**

This rock-inscription is written in bold archaic letters ; the lines are irregular and very close to each other. The inscription is dated in the twenty-sixth year of a king called Kannara-deva, and records that Velur-padi was given to the temple of Pannapesvara on the top of the hill of Sudaduparai *(Sudaduparai-malai)* by Nulamban Tribhuvanadhira, *alias* Mudi-melan Sri-Pallava-Murari. Another Nulamban, the first part of bhuvandadhira,seems to have received Velur-padi together with the hill of Sudaduparai from Vira-Chola. Velur-padi is probably the same as Velapadi, a suburb of Vellore, near which the Bavaji Hill is situated, and which is supposed to be the oldest part of the town.[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/perumai.html#_ftn1) Sudaduparai-malai must have been the old name of the Bavaji Hill. It was situated in the north of Pangala-nadu, a division of Paduvur-kottam. The Siva temple on its top had been founded by, and was called after, a certain Pannappai.

Besides the present Tamil inscription, five obliterated Telugu inscriptions are found on the top of the Bavaji Hill. Four of them mention a certain Nallaguruvayya ; one of these four inscriptions is dated in Saka 1539. the *Pingala* year.

**No.52. ON THE NORTH WALL OF THE PERUMAL TEMPLE AT GANGANURNEAR VELUR**

This inscription is dated in the *Pramathin* year, which was the 17^(th) year of Sakalaloka-chakravartin Sambauvaraya. This date is at variance with that of a Kanchipuram inscription, according to which the *Vyaya* year and the Saka year 1268 corresponded to the 9^(th) year of Sakalalochakravartin Rajanarayana Sambuvaryar,[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/perumai.html#_ftn5)and we must either assume that the 9^(th) year is misreading for the24th year, or that the king mentioned at Kanchipuram and that of the present inscription are two different persons.

The inscription is a receipt for the cost of Kani,[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/perumai.html#_ftn6) which a certain Tiruvengadam-udaiyan seems to have sold[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/perumai.html#_ftn7)
to the villagers of Nilakantha-chaturvedi-mangaam and of Sri-Mallinatha-chaturvedi-mangalam. The first of these two villages was also called Gangeya-nallur[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/perumai.html#_ftn8) *(the modern Ganganur)* and was situated in Karaivari-Andi-nadu[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/perumai.html#_ftn9)

**TRANSLATION**

On the day of *(the nakshatra)* *Rohini,* which corresponds to Monday, the first lunar day of the former half of the month of *Rishabha* of the *Pramathin* year, *(which was)* the 17^(th) year of *(the reign of)* Sakalalokachakravartin, who, having conquered fortune, took the earth, Sambuvaraya, -Whereas I, Kottanpakkam-udaiyanâ€™s *(son)* Tiruvengadam-udaiyan, gave to the great people of Gangeya-nallur, *alais* Nilakantha-chaturvedi-mangalam, a village in Karaivari-Andi-nadu, and to the great people of Sri-Mallinatha-chaturvedi-mangalam a receipt for the cost of a *Kani ;* . . . . . I, kottambakkam-udaiyanâ€™s *(son)* Tiruvengadam-udaiyan, *(hereby declare, that I)* gave a receipt for the cost of a *kani, (as measured by ?)* the accountant of these villages, to the great people of Nilakntha-chaturvedi-mangalam and to the great people of Sri-Mallinatha-chaturvedi-mangalam. This *\[is the signature of\]* Tiruvengadam-udaiya\[n\].

**No.53. ON THE INNER WALL OF THE PERUMAL TEMPLE AT SORAPURAM NEAR VELLUR**

This inscription is written in archaic characters ; it is much obliterated, and incoplete at the end. The date is the twenty-third year of Ko-Vijaya-\[Simha\]vikaramavarman. The inscription records a grant to the Vishnu temple at Kattutumbur, which was probably another name of Sorapuram. The temple had been founded by the same person or persons who made the grant. The object granted was a piece of land at Kanakavalli, which, persons who made the grant. The object granted was a piece of land at Kanakavalli, which, like Kattuttumbur itself,  
belonged to Pangala-nadu, a division of Paduvur-kottam.

**NO. 54. ON THE BASE OF THE ISVARA TEMPLE AT TELLUR NEAR VELUR**

This inscription is dated in the reign of the *mahamandalevara* Virapratapa-Deva-raya-mahraya *(of Vijayanagara)* and in Saka 1353, the *Sadharana* year. It records that the family *(kudi)* of Maranan-ullittar, which belonged to Pallava-nallur, was given to the temple at Tellaiyur *(the modern Tellur),* *alias* Pukkalappuram, which belonged to Vadapuri-Andi-nadu in Pangala-nadu, a division of Padavur-kottam in Jayankonda-Chola-mandalam.

**NO. 55. ON THE WEST AND SOUTH WALLS OF THE VIRPAKSHESVARA TEMPLE AT VEPPAMBATTU NEAR VELUR**

This inscription is dated in Saka 132\[8\] expired and the *Vyaya* year current. It is a deed of sale of the revenue in gold and the revenue in rice of one half of the village of Veppambattu and of the village of Siru-Kadambur. The first-mentioned village belonged to Andi-nadu, a division of Agara-parru. Both villages are stated to have been granted to the temple of Virupaksha-deva[\[12\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/perumai.html#_ftn12) at Veppambattu by Virapratapa-bukka-maharayar (of Vijayanagara), and the temple itself is said to have been consecrated one year before the date of the inscription in the *Parthiva* year, *i.e.,* Saka 1328 current.
This date is puzzling, as it does not agree with other inscriptions, according to which Bukkaâ€™s son Harihara II. was reignng in Saka 1301 and 1321.

The cost of one half of the first village and of the second village as well as the total are given in *Kulapramanas* or *Kulas* of gold (pon) and in *panas.* In line 2 of the south wall another gold standard, called *kovai,* seems to be mentioned. x The numerous sings for fractions, which occur throughout the inscription, are palaeographically interesting.
