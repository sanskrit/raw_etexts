**SANSKRIT INSCRIPTIONS**

**II.-COPPER-PLATE GRANTS OF THE EASTERN CHALUKY DYNASTY**

The subjoined five grants belong to the kings Narendra-mrigaraja or Vijayaditya II, Amma I. Or Vishuvardhana VI, Chalukya-Bhima II. Or Vishnuvardhana VII, Amma II. Or Vijayaditya V. and Vira-Chola or Vishnuvardhana IX. The place, which is occupied by each of these princes in the genealogy of the Eastern Chalukya dynasty, will be seen from the annexed table, for which all hitherto published Eastern Chalukya grants have been consulted, and in which numbers are prefixed to the names of those princes who really reigned, in order to mark their succession.[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/chalukya_dynasty.html#_ftn1)

The relation of the two usurpers (18) Talapa and (21) Yuddhamalla to the direct line of the family is established by three inscriptions : - a. Tadapa is called the son of Vikramadityaâ€™s brother (*Ind. Ant.* Vol XIV, p.56) ; b. Tala is called the son of Yuddhamala, who was the paternal uncle of Chalukya-Bhima I. (*Ind. Ant.* Vol. XII, p.249, where *Pitrivya* has to be read for *Pitrivyo)* ; c. Bhima II, the son of Kollabhiganda Vijayaditya, is at the same time called the son of Yuddhamalla (*Ind. Ant.* Vol. XII, p.92).

Thee of the last kings, who are shown in the annexed table viz., (28) Vijayaditya VI, (29) Rajaraja II. and (30) Vira-Choda, are only known from the subjoined inscription No.39.

**No.35. A GRANT OF NARENDRA-MRIGARAJA**

This grant belongs to the Sir W. Elliot Collection of the British Museum, and was made over to me for publication by Dr. Burgess. It consists of five copper-plates with raised rims. Each place measures 9 by 3 inches. The first and fifth plates are inscribed only on their inner sides, while the three middle ones bear writing on both sides.
The preservation of the plates is tolerably good. They are strung on an elliptic ring, which is Â½â€? thick and 47/8â€? by 3 Â½â€? in diameter.
The Well-preserved circular seal, which is attached to the ring, measures 2 5/8â€? in diameter.

The document is a grant of the *parama-mahasvara* Narendra-mrigaraja, *alias* Vijayaditya II., the son of Vishnuvardhan IV. and grandson of Vijayaditya I. The name of the district *(Vishaya),* to the inhabitants of which the king addresses his order, is lost. On the occasion of a lunar eclipse (*chandra-grahana-nimitte)* the king gave the village of Korraparru to twenty-four brahmanas. Of these, six adhered to the *Hiranyakesi-Sutra* and eighteen to the *Apastamba-sutra.* They belonged to the following *gotras :-* Agnivesya, Kaundiya, Kausika, Gautama, Parasara, Bharadvaja, Vatsa, sandilya, Samkriti and Harita. According to the colophon of the grant, â€œthe excellent prince
