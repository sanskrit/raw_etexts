**NOTES AND FRAGMENTS**

**V. INSCRIPTIONS OF THE KAILASANATHA TEMPLE AT KANCHIPURAM**

**No.144. FRAGMENTS OF GRANTHA INSCRIPTIONS**

Besides the fragments notices below, the shrine of Rajasimhavarmesvara and its *mahamandapa* contain a number of fragments in the *Grantha* character, which must have belonged to one or more inscriptions in Sanskrit verse and prose. One of the fragments, which is found on the floor of the *mahamandapa* and which consists of 10 lines, mentions the Cholas in the genitive case (*Cholanam,* line 3). A second fragment, which is found on the roof of the *mahamandapa,* consists also of 10 lines and seems to be connected with the first. It mentions Chola-trinetra (lines 1 and 10) and three Eastern Chalukya kings, *viz.,* \[Vijay\]aditya-Gunakanga, Chalukya-Bhima and Kollaviganda (line 3.) The name of V\[ai\]dumba, a king who is known to have been conquered by the Chola king Parantaka I., occurs at the beginning of line 5. In lines 7 and 8, (*the temple of the god)* Bhimesvara is mentioned. The 8^(th) line of both fragments seems to have contained a date in the Saka era, of which the first number was 9 and the third was 3. A third fragment, which is found on the floor of the Rajasimhavarmesvara shrine and consists of 49 lines, mentions the Eastern Chalukya king Daranava (line 17) and the Chola king Karikala-Chola[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/kanchi_temple.html#_ftn1) (line 38) and contains a long list of *birudas* of some king. Another list of *birudas* is contained in a fourth fragment, which is found on the roof of the *mahamandapa* and consists of 30 lines. There is a fifth fragment in 9 lines on the roof of the *mahamandapa.* Two small fragments, each of which contains 8 lines, are found near the window, which opens from the *mahamandapa* into the front *mandapa.*

**No.145. ON THE FLOOR OF THE RAJASIMHAVARMESVARA SHRINE**

Each line of this inscription is incomplete at the end. It is dated during the reign of Madirai-konda Ko-Parakesari\[varman\]. Line2mentions â€œthe holy stone-templeâ€? (*Tirukkarrali), i.e.,* the Rajasimhavarmesvara Temple. According to lines 3 and 4, the inscription seems to have recorded an agreement made by the inhabitants of two quarters (*seri)* of Kachchippedu (*i.e.,* Kanchipuram), of which the second was called Ekavirappadi-chcheri and the name of the first also ended in *ppadichcheri*. The term *pallichchandam* occurs in line 5.

**No.146. ON THE ROOF OF THE MAHAMANDAPA OF THE RAJASIMHAVARMESVARA SHRINE**

This fragment is dated in the twelfth year of Ko-Rajakesarivarman, â€œwho built a jewel (-*like)* hall at Kandalur.â€? The mention of Kandalur shows, that the king. has to be identified with that Rajaraja-deva, who causd the inscriptions Nos. 40,41 and 66 to be engraved, and that he built the hall at Kandalur before his twelfth year. The inscription seems to have recorded, that the assembly (*sabha)* of some village pledged themselves, to furnish a yearly supply of paddy to the temple-treasurers (*Siva-pandarigal)* from the interst of a sum of money,[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/kanchi_temple.html#_ftn2) which they had received from â€œthe large holy stone-temple, *alias* Rajasimhesvara, at kanchipuram,â€? or to pay a fine of a quarter *pon* daily. The document is signed by \[Pu\]rambi Surya of Tiruvirapuram.

**No.147. ON THE FLOOR OF THE RAJASIMHAVARMESVARA SHRINE**

These two fragments belong to the time of Ko-Rajakesarivarman. The second is dated in his 3^(rd) year. Each of them records an agreement made by the inhabitants of some village, who pledged themselves to furnish daily one *urakku* of oil for *a nonda* or *nanda* lamp in exchange for a loan of 15 *karnjus* of gold, and is signed by Manatongal Malleruman, a member of the village-assembly (*kuttam).*

**No.148. ON THE ROOF OF THE MAHAMANDAPA OF THE RAJSIMHAVARMESVARA SHRINE**

This fragment, which is dated in the fifteenth year of Ko-Parakesarivarman, contains an agreement made by the inhabitants of some village, who had received a certain sum of money from â€œthe large holy stone-temple (*i.e.,*the Rajasimhavarmesvara Temple) at Kachchippedu (*i.e.,*Kanchipuram).â€? From the interest of this sum, they pledged themselves to supply a ghee for a lamp at the rate of 1 *urakku* per day or 7 *naris* and 1 *uri* per mensem.[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/kanchi_temple.html#_ftn3) The measure to be used was a *nari,* which was equal to *rajakesari[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/kanchi_temple.html#_ftn4).* As the Chola king alternately bore the surnames Rajakesarin and Parakesarin,[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/kanchi_temple.html#_ftn5) it must be assumed, that this measure was called after one of the predecessors of the king, to whose reign the inscription belongs. The writer of the inscription was the village-headman Naga Alappadi.

**No.149. ON THREE STONES AT THE RAJASIMHAVARMESVARA SHRINE**

These are three fragments of what must have been a very long inscription. Its extent may be estimated from the fact, that line 1 of the first fragment corresponds to line 1 of No.67, line 1 of the second fragment to line 6 of No.67. None of the fragments is in its original position. The first and second are built into the roof of the *mahamandapa* of the Rajasimhavarmesvara Shrine. The third fragment is built into the pavement of the veranda near the entrance into the *mahamandapa* ; some letters of each line are covered by a pillar.

Although the name of the king, during whose reign the inscription was engraved, is lost, the existing fragments of the first line, which agree literally with parts of the first, fifth and sixth lines of the inscription No.67, prove, that the inscription was one of Rajendra-Chola-deva. As the list of his conquests reaches here only as far as â€œthe high mountains of Navanedikkula,â€? the date must fall between the 7^(th) and 10^(th) years of the king. The inscription seems to have recorded some gifts of paddy, gold and money.
