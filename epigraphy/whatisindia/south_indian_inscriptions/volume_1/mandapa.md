**VI. -INSCRIPTION OF THE KAILASANATHA TEMPLE AT KANCHIPURAM**

**NO.86. ON A PILLAR IN THE MANDAPA IN FRONT OF THE RAJASIMVARMESVARA SHRINE**

This inscription is dated in the *Visudvasu* year, which was current after the expiration of Saka year 1286,[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/mandapa.html#_ftn1)
and during the reign of Kambana-udaiyar. The inscription No.87 belongs to the same year, as No.86, and to the reign of Vira-Kambanna-udaiyar.
As it mentions Koppangal, an official, whose name occurs also in Nos.86 and 87, and as the signatures at its end are identical with some signatures at the end of No.87, the date of the inscription No.88 cannot have been very distant from that of Nos.86,87 and the, *Kilaka* year must correspond to Saka 1291. The inscription No.87, which reads *Vira-kumara-kambana-udaiyar,* i.e., Kambana-udaiyar, the son of Vira, suggests that *Vira-Kambana-udaiyar* in No.88 is an abbreviation for Kambana-udaiyar, (*the son of)* Vira. The prince, who is mentioned in the three inscriptions Nos.86, 87 and 88, may be further identified with Kambana-udaiyar, the son of Vira-kambana-uadiyar and father of that Ommana-udaiyar, who according to the Tirumalai inscription No.72, above, was reigning in the *Ananda* year, which was current after the expiration of the Saka year 1296. The subjoined table shows the results of the above remarks.

The three inscriptions Nos. 86,87 and 88 contain orders, which were issued by a certain Koppanangal, Koppannangal or Koppanan to the authorities of the temple. Koppanangal was probably the executive officer of Kambana-udaiyar at Rajasimhavarmesvara, Edudattu â€“ayiram-udaiya-nayanar and Tirukkarrali-mahadeva. The last-mentioned term means â€œthe holy stone-temple (*of)* Siva.â€? The meaning of the second is not apparent. The first name, Rajasimhavarmesvara, shows that the Pallava king Rajasimha, the founder of the temple, was not yet forgotten at the times of Kambana-udaiyar, and that his full name was Rajasimhavarman.

From the inscription No.86, we learn that, at the time of Kulottunga-Chola-deva, the Rajasimhavarmesvara Temple at Kanchipuram had been closed, its landed property sold, and its compound and environs transferred to the temple of Anaiyapadangavudaiya-nayanar.[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/mandapa.html#_ftn2) Koppanangal ordered, that the temple should be reopened and that its property should be restored.

The whole *samnidhi* street of this lord shall belong (*to the temple)* as a *sarvamanya,* as long as the moon and the sun exist. According to this edict on a palm-leaf, there shall be engraved on stone the amount of what had been cancelled and given away according to the writing on stone, which was formerly engraved on the day, on which (*the temple)* was closed. (*All this)* shall be managed and attended to without fail. This is the signature of Koppanangal.

**No.87. ON A PILLAR IN THE MANDAPA IN FRONT OF THE RAJASIMHAVARMESVARA SHRINE**

This inscription is dated in the same year and month, as No.86, and during the reign of Kambana-udaiyar, the son of Vira. It records that, with the sanction of Kopanangal, the authorities of the Rajasimhavarmesvara Temple at Kanchipuram sold some houses in the northern row of the *samnidhi* street to certain *Mudalies* at the price of 150 *panas.*
