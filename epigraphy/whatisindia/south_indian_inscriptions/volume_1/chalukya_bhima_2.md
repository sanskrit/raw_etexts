**SANSKRIT INSCRIPTIONS**

**No.37. A GRANT OF CHALUKYA-BHIMA II**

The original of the subjoined inscription was kindly placed at disposal by R. Sewell, Esq., then Acting Collector of the Kistna District, and was, at his desire, made over to the Central Museum, Madras, for safe custody. It was discovered recently, while of three copper-plates near the temple at Kolavennu, Bezvada Talluqa. The document consists of three copper-plates with raised rims. Each plate measures 9 Â¼ by 4 5/8 inches. The first and third plates are inscribed only on their inner sides, while the second one bears writing on both sides. The writing on the third plate breaks off in the description of the boundaries of the granted village. As t here is no trace of any letters after the words : *yasyavadhayah purvatah, â€œ*the boundaries of which (*are)*, to the east,â€? it seems that the document was left incomplete, perhaps because the necessary details of the surroundings of the village were not to hand, when the edict was issued. The plates are strung on a ring, which is Â½ inch thick and 5 inches in diameter. The circular seal, which is attached to the ring, rests on an expanded lotus-flower and measures 2 Â¼ inches in diameter. It bears at the top a standing boar, which faces the right, with the sun and the moon over it, a *chauri* and elephant-goad on its left and a *chauri* on its right ; the centre of the seal is occupied by the legend and its bottom by a lotus-flower with eight petals (*birdâ€™s eye view), -* all in relief on a counter-sunk surface. Both the inscription and the seal are in fairly good preservation.

The inscription opens with a *mangala,* which mentions the lotus-flower that rises from Vishnuâ€™s navel[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/chalukya_bhima_2.html#_ftn1), and then gives the usual *vamsavali* of the Eastern Chalukyas from Kubja-Vishnu to Vikramaditya, the younger son of Chalukya-Bhima I. The ensuing reign of Yuddhamalla, the son of Talapa, is left out. This omission is probably due to the fact, that Chalukya-Bhima II. considered his predecessor, whom he conquered, as an usurper and ignored him purposely. The grant consists of an order addressed by Chalukya-Bhima II. *alias* Vishnuvardhana VII. to the inhabitants of the Kanderuvati-vishya[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/chalukya_bhima_2.html#_ftn2) and issued at the request of a vassal of the king, the Panara prince Vajjaya. On the occasion of a winter-solstice (*uttarayana),[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/chalukya_bhima_2.html#_ftn3)* Bhima II. gave the village of Kodhatalli as an *agrahara* to Kommana, who knew the *kramapatha (kramavid)* and adhered to the *Apastamba-sutra. *The donee was the son of Deniya, who knew the Krampatha *(kramaka),* and of Kandamavva, and the grandson of Revasarman, an inhabitant of Abharad-vasukalmadi.
