**TAMIL AND GRANTHA INSCRIPTIONS**

**V. - INSCRIPTIONS AT PADAVEDU**

**NO.78. ON THE EAST AND NORTH BASES OF THE AMMALAPPESVARA TEMPLE**

This inscription is dated in the year, which was current after the expiration of the Saka year 1180, and records a grant, which Rajagambhira-Sambuvarayan made to the temple of Ammaiappesvara. The name of the object of the grant must be contained in the final portion of the first line, which is buried underground. The donor is evidently identical with that Rajagambhira-Sambuvarayan, who is mentioned in a Tirumalai inscription (No.74), which seems to be dated in Saka 1157-58.
It may be further conjectured, that the Ammaiappesvara Temple at Padavedu had received its name from Ammaiappan or Ammaiyappan, one of the *birudas* of another Sambuvarayan, who was a contemporary and probably a relation of Rajagambhira-Sambuvarayan.

This inscription is dated in the *Suka* year, which was current after the expiration of the Saka year 1371, and during the reign of Virapratapa Praudha-Immadi-Devaraya-maharayar.

[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/padavedu.html#_ftnref1) As Dr.Oppert has shown in the *Madras Journal of Literature and Science
for the year* 1881. p.276, the erroneous forms *Pramoduta* for the two cyclic years *Promoda* and *Pramaddin* owe their origin to some old *versus memoriales,* in two of which we find *Promodo â€˜tha* and *Pramadi cha;* in course of time the two particles *atha* and *cha* were mistaken for portions of the names themselves. In Tamil the two wrong forms have entirely  
superseded the correct ones.

[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/padavedu.html#_ftnref2) Much interesting information on the right and left hand castes in found in Dr.Oppertâ€™s â€œ*On the Original Inhabitants of Bharatavarsha or India,â€?  * Part I, pp.57 to 66.

[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/padavedu.html#_ftnref4) This hill was probably called after Rajgambhira-Sambuvarayan; see the introduction of Nos.74 and 78.
