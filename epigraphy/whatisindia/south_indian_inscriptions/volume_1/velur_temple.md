**No.95. ON THE BASE OF THE ISVARA TEMPLE AT SORAPURAM NEAR VELUR**

1^(st) INSCRIPTION

The end of this inscription is lost. As, however, the preserved parties identical with the above-published inscriptions Nos.40,41 and 66, it may be safely concluded, that the inscription belongs to Ko-Rajaraja-Rajakesarivarman, *alias* Rajaraja-deva. The mention of Iratta-padi shows, that the inscription dates after the twenty-first year of the king.

**No.96. ON THE BASE OF THE ISVARA TEMPLE AT SORAPURAM; 4^(TH) INSCRIPTION**

On the base of this temple, there are at least three obliterated inscriptions besides the preceding one. In the second line of the fourth inscription there occurs the following passage; â€œthe thirty-second \[*year*\] of Ko-Rajakesarivarman, *alias* Kulottunga-Sora-deva.â€?

This inscription is dated in the *Durmati* year and mentions the temple of Rajendra Cholesvara at Sorapuram.

**No. 98. ON A STONE ON THE TANK-BAND AT SORAPURAM**

This inscription is dated in the *Raktakshi* year, which was current after the expiration of the Salivahana-Saka year 1546. It mentions Sorapuram and seems to record some meritorious gift in connection with the tank by Venkatappa-nayaka.

**No. 99 TO 106. INSCRIPTIONS OF THE GANGESVARA TEMPLE AT GANGANUR NEAR VELUR**
