**I. A PALLVA GRANT FROM KURAM**

**No.151. A PALLAVA GRANT FROM KURAM**

The original of the subjoined grant was bought for Government from the *Dharmakarta* of Kuram, a village near Kanchipuram. It is engraved on seven this copper-plates, each of which measures 10 1/8 by 3 Â¼ inches.
as the plates are in very bad preservation, the work of deciphering them was somewhat difficult. Of the seventh plate about one half is completely lost. Next to it, the first, fifth and sixth plates have suffered most. An elliptic ring, which is about 3/8 inch thick and measures 4 by 4 Â¾ inches in diameter is passed through a hole on the left side of each plate. The seal is about 2 Â½ inches in diameter and bears a bull, which is seated on pedestal, faces the left and is surmounted by the moon and a *linga.* Farther up, there are a few much obliterated syllables. A legend of many letters passes round the whole seal. Unfortunately it is so much worn, that I have failed to decipher it.

The language of the first 4 Â½ plates of the inscription is Sanskrit,-verse and prose; the remainder is written in Tamil. The Sanskrit portion opens with three benedictory verses, of which the two first are addressed to Siva and the third mentions the race of the Pallavas. Then follow, as usual, a mythical genealogy of Pallava, the supposed founder of the Pallava race:-

The historical part of the inscription describes three kings, *viz.,* Paramesvaravarman, his father Mahendravarman and his grandfather Narasimhavarman. of Narasimhavarman it says, that he â€œrepeatedly defeated the Cholas, Keralas, Kalabhras and Pandyas,â€? that he â€œwrote (*three)* syllables of (*the word) vijaya (*i.e., *victory),* as on a plate, Pulakesinâ€™s back, which was caused to be visible (i.e., *whom he caused to turn his back)* in the battles of Pariyala, Manimangala, Suramara, *etc.,â€?* and that he â€œdestroyed (*the city of)* Vatapi.â€? No historical information is given about Mahendravarman, who, accordingly, seems to have been an insignificant ruler. A laudatory description of the virtues and deeds of his son Paramesvaravarman fills two plates of the inscription. The only historical fact contained in this long and difficult passage is that, in a terrible battle, he â€œmade Vikaramaditya,-whose army consisted of several *lakshas,-*take to flight, covered only by a rag.â€?

The three kings who are mentioned in the Kuram grant, *viz.,* Narasimhavarman, Mahendravarman and Paramesvaravarman, are identical with three Pallava kings described in Mr.Foulkesâ€™ grant of Nadivarman Pallvamalla[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/kuram.html#_ftn1), Narasimhavarman I., Mahendravarman II. and Paramesvaravarman I. of Narasimhavarman I. the last-mentioned grant likewise states, that he â€œdestroyed Vatapiâ€? and that he â€œfrequently defeated Vallabharaja at Pariyala, Manimangala, Suramara, and other (*places)*.â€? Here Vallabharaja reports, that Paramesvaravarman I. â€œdefeated the army of Vallabha in the battle of Peruvalanallur,â€? It is evident that it alludes to the same fight as is described in the Kuram grant.

If we combine the historical information contained in both grants, it appears-1. that the Pallava king Narasimhavarman I. defeated Pulakesin, *alias* Vallabharaja, at Pariyala, Manimangala, Surama, and other places, and destroyed Varapi, the capital of the Western Chalukyas, and-2.that his grandsonParamesvaravarman I. defeated Vikramaditya, *alias*Vallabha, at Peruvalanallur. As stated above (p.11), Pulakesin and Vikramaditya, the opponents of the two Pallva kings, must have been the Western Chalukya kings Pulikesin II. (Saka 532 and 556) and his son Vikramaditya I. (Saka 592 (?) to 602 (?), who *more* *indico,* likewise boast of having conquered their antagonists.[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/kuram.html#_ftn2) Thus, a grant of Pulikesin II. says, that â€œhe cause the leader of the Pallavas to hide his prowess behind the ramparts of Kanchipura;â€? and, in a grant of Vikramaditya I., it is said that â€œthis lord of the earth, conquering Isvarapotaraja (*i.e.,*Paramesvaravarman I.) took Kanchi, whose huge walls were insurmountable and hard to be broken, which was surrounded by a large moat that was unfathomable and hard to be broken, which resembled the girdle (*Kanchi)* of the southern region (read *dakshinadisah*).â€?[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/kuram.html#_ftn3)

Another Pallava king, *viz.,* Nadipotavarman, is mentioned as the opponent of the western Chalukya king Vikramadiya II. (Saka 655 to 669) in the Vakkaleri grant, which was published by Mr.Rice. The table inserted on p.11, above shows that this Nadipotavarman must be identical with the Pallava king Nandivarman Pallavamalla, who is mentioned in Mr.Foulkesâ€™ grant. Though digressing from my subject, I now sub-join a transcript from the facsimile and a translation of that part of the Vakkaleri grant, which describes the reign of Vikramaditya II.

â€œVikramaditya Satyasraya Sri-Prithivi-Vallabha, the king of great kings, the supreme ruler, the lord,-to whom arose great energy immediately after the time of his anointment at the self-choice of the goddess of the sovereignty of the whole world, and who resolved to uproot completely his natural enemy, the Pallava, who had robbed of their splendour the previous kings born from his race,-reached with great speed the
