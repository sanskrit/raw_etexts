**TAMIL AND GRANTHA INSCRIPTIONS**

**II. INSCRIPTIONS IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF VELUR**

**NO.43. ON A STONE AT ARAPPAKKAM NEAR VELUR**

This and the next-following seven inscriptions record grants to Jvarakhandesvara-svamin of Velur, i.e. to the Vellore Temple, which is nowadays called Jalakanthesvara[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/velur.html#_ftn1).
The name of the temple is spelt Jvarakandesvara in five inscriptions, Jvarakanthesvara in two others and Jvarakandhesvara in one of them. The Sanskrit original of these various forms seems to have been Jvarakhandesvara. Jvarakhanda, â€œthe destroyer of fever,â€? would be a synonym of Javarahara, which is applied to Siva in the name of one of the Kanchipuram temples.[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/velur.html#_ftn2)

The inscriptions Nos.43 to 46 are dated on the same of the *Akshya* year, which was current after the expiration of the Saka year 1488, and during the reign of Sadasiva-deva-maharaja, They record grants which were made to the Vellore Temple at the request of Sinna-Bommu-nayaka of Velur by the *mahamandalesvara* Tirumalaiyadeva-maharaja, also called Tirumalai-rajayan, *(the younger brother of)* Ramaraja, with the consent of Sadasiva-Deva-maharayar.

**The historical results obtained from these four inscriptions are:-**

1\. That Sadasiva-deva of Vijayanagara was still alive in 1566-67 A.D., i.e., ten years after the latest grant mentioned in my second paper on the Karnata Dynasty.[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/velur.html#_ftn3)

2\. That, after the death of his elder brother Rama, Tirumala-raja of Karnata[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/velur.html#_ftn4) continued to acknowledge the king of Vijayanagara as his sovereign and submitted to the title of *mahamandalesvara.*

3\. The Sinna-Bommu-nayaka of the four inscriptions is perhaps identical with â€œBommi Reddi or Naidu,â€? to whom tradition assigns the foundation of the Vellore Temple.[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/velur.html#_ftn5)

The Vilapaka grant of Venkata I. of Karnata dated Saka 1523 mentions a certain Linga-bhupala, son of Veluri-Bomma-nripati and grandson of Virappa-nayaka-kshamapa.[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/velur.html#_ftn6) Velluri-Bomma is evidently the same as Sinna-Bommu-nayaka of Velur.
From the title â€œPrinceâ€? , which the Vilapaka grant attributes to Bomma and to his father and son, it follows that his family were petty chiefs under the kings of Karnataka, who were again nominally dependent on the kings of Vijayanagara.
