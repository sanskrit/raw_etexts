** II. INSCRIPTIONS AT VIJYANAGARA**

**No.152. ON A LAMP-PILLAR AT VIJAYANAGARA**

A rough transcript andparaphrase of the subjoined inscription was published as early as 1836 in the *Asiatic Reserches.* The original is engraved on a lamp-pillar in front of a Jaina temple at the ruined city of Vijayanagara. The temple is now-a-days styled Ganigitti Temple, *i.e., â€œ*the temple of the oil-women.â€?[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/vijayanagara.html#_ftn1)

The inscription consists of 28 Sanskrit verses and commences with an invocation of Jina (verse 1) and of his religion (*Jina-sasana, v.*2).
Then follows a pedigree of the spiritual ancestors and pupils of the head of a Jaina school, who was called Simhanandin:-

The various epithets, which these teachers receive in the inscription, are :-*acharya, arya, guru, desika, muni* and *yogindra.* Other Jaina terms, which occur in the inscription are :- *syadvada (*v. 2.) or *anekanta-mata (*v.22), *patta* (vv. 11 and 12) and *chaityalaya* (v.28.)

The pedigree of Jaina teachers is followed by a short account (vv. 15 to 18) of two kings of the first Vijayanagara dynasty, *viz.,* Bukka, who was descended from the race of the Yadava kings, and his son Harihara (II). Hariharaâ€™s hereditary minister was the general (*dandadhinayaka,* vv.19 and 21; *dandanatha,* v.20) Chaicha or Chaichapa. Chaichaâ€™s son, the general (*dandesa,* vv.21.22 and 28) or prince (*kshitisa* v.23; *dharanisa*, v.24) Iruga or Irugapa, adhered to the doctrine of the above-mentioned Jaina teacher Simhanandin (v.24). In Saka 1307 \[expired\],[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/vijayanagara.html#_ftn2) the cyclic year *Krodhana* (lines 36 f.), Iruga built a stone-temple of Kunthu-Jinatha (v.28) at Vijayanagara (v.26). This city belonged to Kuntala, a district of the Karnata country. (v.25).

Through my assistant I received a copy,-printed with a Telugu commentary in the *Rudhiraodgari-samvatsara (i.e.,*1863-64 A.D.),-of a Sanskrit *kosa,* entitle target="\_self"d *Nanartharatnamala* and composed by Irugapa-dandadhinatha or, as he calls himself in the opening verses, Iruga-dandesa. Dr.Oppert mentions a large number of MSS. of the same work. Dr.Aufrecht[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/vijayanagara.html#_ftn3) describes three inferior MSS. of it and states that, according to one of these, its composer lived under a king Harihara. This notice enables us to identify the author of the *Nanartharatnamala* with the general Iruga or Irugappa of the subjoined inscription. 

**TRANSLATION**

(*Verse* 1.) May that Jina, the dust of whose lotus-feet removes mental impurity, and who is an abode of comparison, produce abundant happiness !

(*Verse* 2.) May the religion of the lord of the three worlds, the religion of Jina, the unfailing characteristic of which is the glorious and extremely mysterious scepticism, be victorious!

(*Verse* 3.) In the glorious Mula-samgha, there arose the Nandi-samgha; in this, the lovely, the pure-minded Padmanandin.[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/vijayanagara.html#_ftn4)

(*Verse* 4.) The *acharya* called Kunda\[kunda\], Vakragriva, Mahamati, Elacharya and Gridhrapinchha:-these (*were)* his five *(sur)*names.

(*Verse* 5.) Just as pearls in the ocean, there appeared in his (*spiritual)* race (*anvaya)* certain beautiful sages, who were mines of speeches  
and endowed with divine splendour.

(*Verse 6.)* Among these, there was a teacher, who was an ocean of beautiful deeds, which resembled pearls, the chief of ascetics (*called)* Dharmabhushana, who was distinguished by the title of *Bhattaraka.*

(*Verse 7.)* Resplendent is the *Bhattaraka* Dharmabhushana, whose (*only)* ornament are virtues;even as a bee, the (*whole)* sky *(enjoys)* the perfume of the flower of his fame.

(*Verse* 8.) The pupil of this sage was the glorious saint Amarakirti, a treasury of austerities of unrestrained *(power),* the foremost of teachers, and full of tranquility.

(*Verse* 9*.)* I worship that Amarakirti, who removes darkness, and in whose heart the lamp of knowledge never flickers in consequence of his shutting the door of his eye-lids and suppressing his breath.

(*Verse* 10.) Let many chiefs of ascetics arise on earth, who are bent (only) on filling their bellies, and whose minds are devoid of knowledge; what is their use in this world, (*though they be)* endless (*in number) ? (For)* there appears the pupil of Amarakirti, the glorious, wise, and dutiful teacher Simhanandin, the head of a school *(ganabhrit),* who scatters (*their)* invincible and great pride by his mighty virtues.

(*Verse* 11.) His (*successor) is office[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/vijayanagara.html#_ftn5)* was the glorious *Bhattaraka* Dharmabhusha, who equalled (*his)*glorius teacher, the saint Simhanandin, who resembles a pillar of the palce of they holy religion of Jina, and whose fame (*possessed the splendour of)* the lotus and the moon.

(*Verse* 12.) (*The successor)* in office of this sage was a lord of sages, *(called)* Vardhamana, who was a bee at the lotus-feet of the glorious Simhanandin, the chief of ascetics.

(*Verse* 13.) The pupil of this teacher was the teacher Dharmabhushana, (*also called)* the glorious Bhattarakamuni[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/vijayanagara.html#_ftn6), who was free from the three thorns.[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/vijayanagara.html#_ftn7)

(*Verse* 14.) We praise the feet of Battarakamuni, those unheard-of-lotuses, before which the hands of kings *(raja-karah)* are devoutly folded, (*which the day-lotus closes under the influence of the rays of the moon*:-raja-karah).

(*Line* 21.) While thus the succession of teachers continued without interruption:-

(*Verse* 15.) There was in the race of the Yadava princes the illustrious king Bukka, whose might was boundless, and who was exalted by perfect virtues.

(*Verse* 16.) From this prince there sprang the lord Harihara, a king who knew all arts (*kala),-*just as the (*full)* moon, who possesses all digits (*kala),* was produced from the milk-ocean.

(*Verse* 17.) While this prince, who has conquered the world by his valour, is *(her)* lord, this earth possesses-ah!-at last a *king* who deserves this title.

\>

(*Verse* 18.) While this lord of kings, who surpassed al former princes, ruled the earth, whose girdle are the four oceans,-

(*Verse* 19.) The hereditary minister of him, whose wife was the earth, was the general Chaicha, who was endowed with the three (*regal)* powers.

(*Verse* 20.) (*His)* second soul in *(state)* secrets *(and his)* third arm on battle-fields,-the illustrious and great general Chaichapa is (*ever)* vigilant in the service of king Hari.

*(Verse* 21.) The son of this illustrious and brilliant general Chaicha was the general Iruga., who delighted the world.

(*Verse* 22.) Oh general Iruga ! This great fame (of thine),-which is not corporeal, because it pervades the whole world, (*but which is at the same time)* corporeal, because it resembles in splendour Siva and the full-moon[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/vijayanagara.html#_ftn8), as it shines in autumn,-says for a long time:-â€œIn this world there is no higher doctrine than the lovely scepticism.â€?[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/vijayanagara.html#_ftn9)

(*Verse* 23.) The bow of this prince Iruga loudly teaches, as it were, right conduct to the people, as it is of good bamboo (*or of good family),* endowed with a string (*or with virtues)* and a receptacle of arrows (*or a refuge of beggars),* but is bent (*or humble)* and causes the enemies *(or the best)* to bow.

(*Verse* 24.) Prince Irugapa, that moon (*who causes to unfold)* the lotus of the goddess of prosperity of the great empire of king Harihara, he who has reached the highest point of prowess and profundity, the only abode of valour, *(was)* a bee at the lotus-feet of Simhanandin, the best saints.

*(Line* 36). Hail ! In the Saka year 1307, while the *Krodhana* year was current, on Friday, the second lunar day of the dark half of the month of *Phalguna;-*

*(Verse* 25.) There is a district (*vishaya),* Kuntala by name, which is situated in the midst of the vast country (*dhara-mandala)* of Karnata, and which resembles the hair (*kuntala)* of the goddess of the earth.

(*Verse* 26.) In this (*country)* there is a city (*nagara),* named Vijaya, which is resplendent with wonderful jewels, and which exhibits the spectacle of an unexpected moonshine by the multitude of its whitewashed palaces.

(*Verse* 27.) There the girls play on roads paved with precious stones, stopping by embankments of pearl-sand the water (*poured out)* at donations.

(*Verse* 28.) In this city the general Iruga caused to be built of fine stones a temple (*chaityalaya)* of the blessed Kunthu[\[10\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/vijayanagara.html#_ftn10), the lord of Jinas.

(*Line* 42.) Let there be prosperity to the religion of Jina !

[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/vijayanagara.html#_ftnref4) According to Dr. Aurfrechtâ€™s *Catalogus Bibliothece Bodleiance,* p.180, a Jaina MS. of A.D. 1518 contains the following slightly different pedigree of Padmanandin: *Sri-Mula-samghe Sarasvati-gachchhe Balatkara-gane Sri-kundakundacharyanvaye Bhattaraka-Sri-Padmanandi-devah.* Here Padmanandin is said to belong to the spiritual race of Kundakundachrya, while our inscription (verse 4) gives Kundakundacharya as one of the names of Padmanadin himself.
According to Mr.Pathak (*Ind. Ant.* Vol.XIV, p.15) the correct spelling of Kundakunda, as the present inscription seems to read, is Kundakunda. The Terdal inscription (i.e., p.25) has Kondakundacharya;Professor Wilson (*Essays,* Vol.I, p.341),-kundakmundacharya; and an unpublished inscription at Sravana-Belagola-Kaundakunda.

[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/vijayanagara.html#_ftnref5) *Patta, â€œ*a tiara worn as an emblem of dignity,â€? is here used for the dignity itself. It has the same meaning in *Pattavali,* a title of two lists of Jaina teachers, extracts from which were published by Dr.Klatt in *Ind. Ant.*Vol. XI, pp.245 ff.

[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/vijayanagara.html#_ftnref6) An earlier *Bhattaraka* Dharmabhushana was mentioned in verses 6 and 7,and a *Bhattaraka* Dharmabhusha in verse 11.

[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/vijayanagara.html#_ftnref7) Pandit-Lakshmanacharya of Bangalore informs me that, according to the *Vedantachudamani, â€œ*the three thronsâ€? (*salya-traya)* are thesameas â€œthe three kinds of painâ€? (*tapa-traya),* viz., that produced by oneself (*adhyatmika),* by other beings (*adhibautika)* and by the gods *(adhidaivika).*

[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/vijayanagara.html#_ftnref8) With *raka-vita* compare *raka-sasnka* in verse 8 of No.153, below.

[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/vijayanagara.html#_ftnref9) The *anekanta-mata* is the same as the *syadvada* ; see page 158, note 1. What the composer of the inscription wants to express by verse 22, is, that Irugaâ€™s fame furnishes a proof of the correctness of the Jaina doctrine of sceptiscism, as arguments can be adduced for its being not corporeal, as well as for its being corporeal.

[\[10\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/vijayanagara.html#_ftnref10) Kunthu is the name of the seventeenth Tirthakara; see Professor Jacobiâ€™s *Jaina Sutras,* Part I, Index *s.v.*
