**TAMIL AND GRANTHA INSCRIPTIONS**

**VI. -INSCRIPTION OF THE KAILASANATHA TEMPLE AT KANCHIPURAM**

**NO.82. ON A PILLAR IN THE MANDAPA IN FRONT OF THE RAJASIMHAVARMESVARA SHRINE**

The following inscription is dated in the fifteenth year of Madirai-kondaKo-Para-Kesarivarman. The same names are borne by the Chola king Parantaka I., *alais* Viranarayana, in a copper-plate grant published by Mr.Foulkes. As Madirai seems to stand for Madurai (*Madura),* the capital of the Pandyas,-Madirai-konda, â€œwho took Madura,â€? might also beconsidered as the Tamil equivalent of Madhurantaka, â€œthe destroyer of Madura.â€? This was the name of a grandson of Parantaka I. according to the large Leyden grant[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/kanchipuram.html#_ftn1).
Another Madhurantaka, who was the son of Rajaraja, issued the Sanskrit portion of the Leyden grant after his fatherâ€™s death. He is probably identical with Rajendra-Chola-deva, who, according to Nos.67 and 68, conquered the Madura-mandalam. The three kings just mentioned are Nos. 3,9 and 11 of the subjoined table, which I insert for ready reference.
It contains the pedigree of the Cholas according to the large Leyden grant. The first three kings of the table are also named in Mr.Foulkesâ€™ above-mentioned grant. On inscriptions of the two last kings and on other conquests of theirs, see the introductions of Nos.40 and 67, above.

On Rajendra-deva, the probable successor of (11) Rajendra-Chola, see the remarks on No 127, below. In the introduction of No.67, I might have added the Miraj grant of the Western Chalukya King Jayasimha III. calls (Rajendra-) Chola *Pancha-Dramiladhipati* (read thus instead of *yain Chamdramiladhipati[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/kanchipuram.html#_ftn2)), â€œ*the lord of the five Dravida (*nations)*.[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/kanchipuram.html#_ftn3)â€? The village, which was the object of the Miraj grant, belonged to â€œthe Edadore (read thus instead of *Paddore*) Two-thousand.â€? Accordingly, the country of Edatore in Maisur must have been in the possession of Jayasimha III. in Saka 946 (expired). The Same country in Edatore *(Idaiturai-nadu)* occupied the first place in the list of the conquests of the conquests of Rajendra-Chola-deva.

The subjoined inscription records that a certain Chandaparakrama-vira gave to the god of â€œthe holy stone-templeâ€? (*i.e.,*the RaRajasimhavarmesvara Temple) at Kanchipuedu (*i.e.,*Kanchipuram) 270 sheep, from the milk of which three lamps had tobe supplied with ghee.
A certain Chandaparakrama-manradi, who seems to be distinct from the donor, pledged himself, that he and his descendants would supply the ghee daily or otherwise incur certain fixed fines.

It is worthy of note, that in this very archaic inscription the *pulli* or the dot above consonants, which corresponds to the Nagari *virama,* occurs five times. It is represented by a short vertical stroke. The same sign is found in the Tamil portion of the Kuram plates of the Pallava king Paramesvaravarman I.(No.151, below.)

**TRANSLATION**

Hail! Prosperity! In the fifteenth year of (*the reign of)* Madirai-konda Ko-Para-kesarivarman, *(the following)* written agreement (*was made)* with Maadeva of the large holy stone-temple at Kachchippedu by me, Chandaparakrama-manradi, Chandaparakrama-vira gave two hundred and seventy undying and unending[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/kanchipuram.html#_ftn4) big sheep to the god of the holy stone-temple, (*in order to keep)* three *nanda* lamps (*burning)* as long as the moon and the sun exist.
From (*the milk of)* these sheep,--myself, my sons and my further descendants shall take three *urakkus* of ghee daily and shall, for ever, pour them out into the hands of those, who are in charge of the *(measure)* which is equal to four *urakkus.[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/kanchipuram.html#_ftn5)* If I do not pour them out, I shall be liable to a fine of four and a quarter (*urakkas)* daily in court. Although I am fined thus, I shall pour out this ghee without resistance. If I resist, I solemnly agree to pay one *manjadi[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_1/kanchipuram.html#_ftn6)* of gold daily to the king who is then ruling. . . . . . This meritorious gift *\[shall last as long as\]* the moon and the sun.

**NO.83. ON A PILLAR IN THE MANDAPA IN FRONT OF THE RAJASIMHAVARMESVARA SHRINE**

Like the inscription No.82, this one is dated in the fifteenth year of Madirai-konda Ko-Parakesarivarman, and records the gift of 180 sheep from the same Chandapara-krama-vira to â€œthe holy stone-templeâ€?. A certain Kalakopa-vira-manradi pledged himself to supply two lamps with ghee made from the milk of these sheep.

A graphical peculiarity of this archaic inscription has to be noted. In two cases the sign of *d* in *na* and *ra* is not, as in modern Tamil, attached to the bottom of the letter, but is added after it and turned upwards.

**TRANSLATION**
