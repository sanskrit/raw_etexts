This inscription is engraved below a group of sculptures reproduced on the accompanying plate. It states that, during the reign of Madhurantakadeva alias Uttama-Chola, his mother Madevadigalar alias Sembiyan-Madeviyar caused to be built in the name of her husband Gandaradityadeva, a stone temple at Tirunallam, i.e., the modern Konderirajapuram, which is one of the ancient Saivite places of worship mentioned in the Devaram. The inscription serves as a key to understand the sculptures below which it is engraved. The female figure kneeling down in a worshipping posture is Queen Sembiyan Madeviyar and the one close to the linga is Gandaradityadeva. The two figures behind the queen are her attendants. The name Adityesvara-Mahadeva which occurs in other inscriptions of Konerirajapuram indicates that it was derived from Gandaraditya. 

Hail ! Prosperity! Madevadigalar alias the glorious Sembiyan-Madeviyar, queen of Gandaradityadeva, constructed in the sacred name of her husband (viz.,) the glorious Gandaradityadeva, a stone temple to the lord (i.e., the god) of Tirunallam (at the time) when her illustrious son, i.e., the glorious Madhurantakadeva alias the glorious Uttama-Chola, was graciously ruling. This is (the image of) the glorious Gandaradityadeva which was (caused to be) made in this sacred stone temple in the posture of worshipping the sacred feet of the lord (i.e., the god) of Tirunallam.

This and the next number together constitute one record of Parakesarivarman who is identical with Madhurantaka Uttama-Chola. The object of the inscription is to register the grant of certain lands to the temple at Tirunallam in Vennadu, which had been constructed of stone by queen Sembiyan-Madeviyar in the name of her husband Gandaraditya.
Prior to the date of this record she is stated to have laid out a new flower-garden for the temple by purchasing lands from the assembly of Tirunallam and getting them exempted from payment of taxes and to have increased the original provision for feeding Brahmanas in the temple.
The king also granted in the 3rd year of this reign two veli of land for the upkeep of the garden and in the sixth year a further 16 veli for the expenses in connexion with the feeding of Brahmanas ( II. 24 to 26).

In the 7th year and 240th day of his reign when the king was encamped at Pichchankoyil, one of his executive officers named Parakesari Muvendavelan informed the former that the gift for feeding Brahanas was not sufficient and that a further gift of 12 veli of land had to be made. This was done accordingly in the 7th year of reign (II. 23 to 40). A detailed description of the boundary line of the two veli and the 12 veli of land respectively granted for the maintenance of the flower-garden and the feeding house is given in 47 lines (II. 51 to 98). The privileges and exemptions granted in favour of these two lands occupy lines 99 to 115. With line 116 commences a new grant dated in the 8th year and 143rd day of the same king when he was encamped at Karaikkattu Panaiyur. The request now was for regulation of the expenses for all the income derived from the devadana lands of the Tirunallam temple. Accordingly, on the 151st day of the same year the king ordered that specified amounts of gold and paddy collected as tax on the devadana lands of Tirunallam were to be deducted from the general revenue and that the number of Brahmanas who were fed in the feeding house be raised from 25 to 40, the additional being met from the remaining balance under a certain item provided from in the old regulations.
