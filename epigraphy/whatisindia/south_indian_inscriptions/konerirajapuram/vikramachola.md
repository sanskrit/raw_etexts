**Konerirajapuram, Thanjavur Taluk, Thanjavur District**

**North wall of the same mandapa. Parakesarivarman alias Tribh Vikramacholadeva : Year 13, Karkataka (Adi) ba. (the tithi is omitted),**

**Punarpusam=1130 A.D., July 6. The tithi was ba. 14.**

This inscription is damaged in some places and its continuation is not traceable. It contains the prasasti of the king commencing with Pumadu
punara, etc.

It records that the various groups of servants like the devakanmis, Srimaesvarakkankanis, sabhaikkankanis and the \[Japan\] doing people of the temple of the god Tirunalamudaiyar of Tirunalam, a BrahmadeyamÂ¸ in Vennadu in Uyyakkondar-valanadu, received a gift of land in the, year 5 of the reign in Dhanus (Margali) ba. 4, Wednesday, Maraiyurai (?) made by a certain Aritan Tiruchchirrambalamudaiyan Tilainayakan of the same place, to provide for food and other offerings to the god from the month of Tai. It states that the tenants of the gift-land left the place not being able to pay their dues to the temple and that therefore the temple services were perhaps suspended. To remedy this situation of the above-mentioned groups of the temple servants received the gift of paddy from a certain Sinayakan in the month of Arpagai and had agreed to provide the offerings to the god as well as arrange to feed of Sivasogi (Sivayogi) everyday in the temple from out of the interest on the gift paddy.

**\[......\] 13,Svati=1120 A.D., April 15. The paksha was sukla and the tithi was 15.**

This inscription is very much damaged and so only a few particulars can be gleaned. It contains the prasasti of the king (name lost) commencing with Pumalai madaindu, etc.

It appears to state that the Perumguri mahasabhai of Tirunalam, assembled and decided to sell some land in the place, probably to a person (name lost), the kilavan of Madavur in Ambara-nadu in the same \[vala\]-nadu, who probably endorsed the same to the temple to provide for feeding the Sivasagi (Sivayogi) who visited the temple as apurvis (coming without previous notice). It further that the sabhai made the land tax-free in this connection.
