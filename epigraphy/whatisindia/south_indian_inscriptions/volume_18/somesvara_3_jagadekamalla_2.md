This inscription referring itself to the reign of **Bhulokamalladeva** is dated in the **Chalukya-Vikrama year 53, Kilaka, Sravana, Friday, Samkramana, magha-nakhsatra.** The *tithi* is lost. The details correspond to **A.D. 1128, July 27, Friday.** *Nakshatra* Magha however did not occur on that day.

It records a grant of certain incomes made to *Pattavardhana* **Gobinda-Ghaisasa** of **Mudugundur** by **Mahadevarasa,** the *Dandanayaka* in charge of *vaddaravula,* **Ketamallasetti,** the *Pergade* in charge of the *herjjunka* and **Duggarasa** the *Heggade of bilukode.* The last two were officers under *Mahamandalesvara* **Tailahadeva.**

1130

This inscription referring itself to the reign of **Bhulokamalladeva** is dated in the **55^(th) year** of his reign **Sadharana, Kartika ba. Chaturdasi, \[Saturday\].** The week-day is expressed by the single syllable *Sau* which apparently is an abbreviation of Saurivara (Saturday). The regnal year 55 is a mistake either for 5 of the kingâ€™s reign of 55 of the reign of his predecessor Vikramaditya VI.
In either case it coincides with the cyclic year Sadharana. The details correspond to **A.D. 1130, November 1, Saturday.**



It records a grant of land made by *Dandanayaka* **Holakesideva** to the god **Bhimesvara of Banniyur** (modern Bannikop, the find spot of the record). The grant was entrusted to **Amritarasi-Pandita.**
