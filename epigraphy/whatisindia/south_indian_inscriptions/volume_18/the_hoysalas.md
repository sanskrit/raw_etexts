**BOMBAY KARNATAKA INSCRIPTIONS**

**VOLUME III**

**The Hoysalas**

Two inscriptions of **Vira-Ballala II** of this dynasty may be reviewed here. One of them (No. 193) gives the date as the 16^(th) year of his reign, cyclic year Plavanga, without any further details. The cyclic year Plavanga during his reign coincided with A.D. 1187-88. This would show that the first year of his reign was counted from A.D. 1172-73 and since we know that he was crowned in A.D. 1173, the reckoning found in this record should be considered to have started from the date of his coronation. The second record (No. 195) however shows a different reckoning. The date found in this record is his 13^(th) regnal year, Dundubhi, Vaisakha su. 15, Monday, Samkranti, corresponding to A.D. 1202, Aprial 8. Accordingly the commencement of his reign should have taken place some time before 8^(th) Aprial, 1190. This date would show that Ballala established a second reckoning of his own, after acquiring the sovereignty of the Western Chalukyas, a year earlier than the date fixed for this even by Fleet. Thus there were two reckonings current for the commencement of this kingâ€™s reign.

This inscription is dated in the **16^(th) regnal year of Vira-Ballaladeva, Plavanga** which corresponds to **A.D. 1187-88.** Further details of the date or lost. It records the death of **Dasoa,** son of the goldsmith \[**So**\]**voja,** in a cattle-raid and registers a gift of land by some *Gaudas* for the hero-stone set up by his brother **Masaloja** and **Ketoja.** The record is damaged.

On the *tithi* given the weekday was Friday which correspond to A.D. 1197, December 12. Ba. 2 of this month however was Sunday, 28^(th) December 1197, and the *Uttarayana-samkramana* had occurred on the 25^(th). It records the gift of an oil-mill and a house-site by **Polalva-Dandanayaka** amd Rajadhyaksha **Davanna** to the temple of Kesavadeva of Hommavatti.

**No. 195**

**(B.K. No. 7 of 1934-35)**

**Benakankonda, Ranebennur Taluk, Dharwar District**

**Slab set up near the southern entrance of the Kalamesvara temple**

**Vira-Ballala II-A.D. 1202**

This inscription is dated in the **13^(th) year** of the reign of **Vira-Ballaladeva, Dundubhi, Vaisakha su. 15, Monday, Sankranti.**
Palaeographically the record may be assigned roughly to the 12^(th) century A.D. and hence the Ballala of this record may be identified with Ballala II. In his reign the cyclic year Dudubhi corresponds to **A.D. 1202-3.** In that year the given details correspond to **A.D. 1202, April 8, Monday f.d.t. .06.** The month was *Adhika Vaisakha.*

It registers a grant of land and house-site made by the **Prabhu** of Belugali and others to **Chaudeya-Nayaka** and others for effecting repairs to the tank of **Harakata.** The grant was made during the time of **Kumara Vira-Vikramaditya,** the son of *Mahamandalesvara* **Jagadala Chattamadeva.** The land-measure *Gangana-ghale* is mentioned.

The record, which contains many scribal errors has been engraved very carelessly.

**No. 196**

**(B.K. No. 88 of 1932-33)**

**Haveri, Haveri Taluk, Dharwar District**

**Has been in the Navaranga-mantapa in the Siddhesvara temple**

**Vira-Ballala II-A.D. 1207**

This inscription is dated in the cyclic year **Prabhava of the reign of Vira-Ballala, Vaisakha ba. 8, Saturday.** On paleographic grounds the present record may be assigned to the reign of Vira-Ballala II. In his reign the details correspond regularly to **A.D. 1207, Aprial 21, Saturday.** It records the gift of money made by **Surigeya Pirumaleyanna,** son of *Mahapradhana, Sarvadhikari* and *Mahapasayta* **Odeyanna,** the sword-bearer, for burning a perpetual lamp to god **Siddhanathadeva.** The gift was entrusted to **Galatigeya Malli-etti,** in the presence of the devotees and the **Four-hundred** (*Mahajanas*). A supplementary grant made for the same purpose and to the same person by **Heggade Vaijayya** has also been recorded.
