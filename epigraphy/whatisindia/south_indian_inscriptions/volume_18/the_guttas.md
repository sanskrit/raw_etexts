**The Guttas**

Another distinguished feudatory fairly large number of inscriptions in this volume is that the Guttas of Guttavolal (modern Guttal in Haveri Taluk).

The first member of the family of whom we have an inscription is **Mallideva** whose approximate date is A.D. 1115, as suggested by Fleet. The name of his younger brother **Joma** who was unknown hitherto is revealed by a record (No. 124) at Honnatti. It is dated in the Chalukya-Vikrama year 48 (A.D. 1124) when he was in charge of the administration of Ponnavartti Twelve, Beluhuge Seventy and Bennevur Twelve, Beluhuge Seventy with Guttavolal as his headquarters. Since this Joma is the first of that name is this family he has to be designated as **Joma I** and Joma the grandson of his elder brother Mallideva who used to be re designated as **Joma II.**

The next person of this family is **Vikramaditya,** son of Malli.
Though he was known from the genealogical accounts found in the inscriptions of this dynasty, no record of his time had been found till now. In the present collection we have an inscription (No. 293) which gives him the date Saka 1084 (A.D. 1162). He is described therein as being in administrative control of the same divisions as Joma I.
Another inscription (No. 296) gives the name of his wife as **Siriyadevi,** which was not known before. A chief named Joyideva of this family figures in a record (No. 302) of A.D. 1187. If the date is recorded correctly, he may have to be considered as Joyideva II for whom the latest date known so far is 1181. In that case Vikramaditya II whose earliest known date is 1182 will have to be considered as being associated with Joyideva II in administration for some time.

**Vijayamahadevi,** the sister of **Vikramaditya II** is another new person found in one of the records (No. 300) published in this volume.
She was married to **Simgideva** of **Santali-mandala** to whose son **Ballala,** this Vikramadityaâ€™s daughter was married.

Only two sons of Vikramaditya II *viz.,* **Joyideva** and **Vikramaditya** were known till now. But the name of another son *i.e.,* **Gutta,** who seems to be the eldest, is found in a record from Chaudadanpur (No. 244). This Gutta would then be **Gutta III** and his nephew Gutta (the son of Vikramaditya III) will be **Gutta IV.** This same inscription discloses the name of another son of Vikramaditya III besides **Gutta, Hiriyadeva** and **Joyideva,** who were already known. The name of this newly discovered person is **Vikrama** whose younger brother is stated to be Gutta(IV). An inscription of A.D. 1283 from Hirebidari in Ranebennur Taluk of Dharwar District discloses the name of yet another member of this family, *v.z.,* Vikramaditya, son of Joma. He may be regarded as the son of Joyideva IV and called Vikramadity V. His wifeâ€™s name is given in the same inscription as Padmaladevi.

Vilambi, Pushya, su. 3, Sunday, Uttarayana-Samkranti.** The date is irregular. In *Vilambi* neither *su.* 3 nor the *Uttarayana-samkramana* fell on Sunday. In the previous year, however, (i.e., in *Hemalambi*) both these did occur on Sunday. In the the latter is the intended date, its equivalent would be **A.D. 1177, December 25, Sunday.** The year **102** is latest known year of the *Chalukya-Vikrama* era.
