**BOMBAY KARNATAKA INSCRIPTIONS**

**VOLUME III**

**Mysore Rulers**

## Tipu Sultan

Epigraphical evidence to show that **Tipu Sultanâ€™s** sway extended up to Ranebennur Taluk, is forthcoming from an inscription (No. 289) at Chennapur in that Taluk. It says that under the orders of Tipu Sultan, the village Chennapura was granted as *sarvamanya* in the cyclic year Parabhava. In the reign of Tipu Sultan (*i.e.,* A.D. 1782 to 1799) this cyclic year fell in A.D. 1786-87.
