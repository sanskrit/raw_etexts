**A.D. 600(?)**

This inscription is dated in **Saka 522, Kalayukta, Margasira su. 2 Monday.** Dr. Fleet who remarks that the date is not authentic gives the equivalent as **A.D. 600, November 13,** which was a **Sunday** and not Monday.

This record which refers to *Mahamandatadhipati* **Santivarma** of the **Matura** family as governing **Banavasi Twelve-thousand** with the (river) Varade as the boundary, narrates a conversation with the maidens of **Palarur** when Santivarma visited the village and demanded grass for his horses and elephants.

**Devageri, Haveri Taluk, Dharwar District**

This fragmentary record of about the **7-8^(th) century A.D.** seems to register a gift of *gosasa* made by **Ammakirti.**

**(B.K. No. 73 of 1932 â€“ 33)**
