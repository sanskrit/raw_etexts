**No. 60**

**(B.K. No. 153 of 1932-33)**

**Mallur, Haveri Taluk, Dharwar District**

**Stone in Survey No. 180**

**Somesvara I-A.D 1048**

This inscription referring itself to the reign of **Trailokyamalladeva,** is dated in **Saka 970, Sarvadhari, Pushya su. 5, Sunday, Uttarayana-Samkramana,** corresponding to **A.D. 1048, December 11, Sunday f.d.t. .83.** The *Samkramana,* however, fell on Saturday, the 24^(th) December.



It states that when *Mahamandalesvara* **Chavundarayarasa** was governing **Banavasi Twelve-thousand** and **Santailge Thousand,** Barmadevaâ€™s son *Kumara* **Jomadevarasa,** who was governing **Basavura Hundred-and-forty,** went to Mallavura and made a grant of land to the god of that place. The gift was entrusted to Tribhuvanasinga-jiya. The composer of the record is described as being well-versed in all Sastras. The record is damaged at places.



It may be noted in this connection that, in No. 69 below, Jomadevarasa is called the son of Chavundaraya. But in No. 73, Barmadeva is stated to be the brother of Chavundaraya. It is possible that in the present record Barmadeva is mistakenly stated to be his son. In No. 69, Jomadevarasa is called the son of Chavundaraya perhaps because he was the son of the brother of Chavundaraya. This practice is not unusual in the Kannada country.
