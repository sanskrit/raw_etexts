**The Rashtrakutas**

**No. 9**

**(B.K. No. 159 of 1932-33)**

**Mantagi, Haveri Taluk, Dharwar District**

**Hero-stone lying in Survey No. 1**

**Govinda III â€“ (Undated)**

This damaged inscription referring itself to the reign of **Prabhutavarsha,** records the death of a hero (name lost). A certain **Kaundala** is mentioned. On the grounds of paleography the king may be identified with **Govinda III.**

**No. 10**

**(B.K. No. 166 of 1932-33)**

**Sangur, Haveri Taluk, Dharwar District**

**Hero stone in Talavarike-hakkalu near the temple of Ramalinga**

**Jagattunga â€“ (Undated)**

This inscription referring itself to the reign of **Jagattunga,** records the death of **Baliya Recha-gamunda** during the destruction of **Samgavur,** when **\[Da\]ntiga** was governing the *nadu.* **Gamile,** probably his wife, erected the memorial. The characters belongs to the **9^(th) century A.D.**

**No. 11**

**(B.K. No. 23 of 1934-35)**

**Hiremaganur, Ranebennur Taluk, Dharwar District**

**Slab set up in front of the Kallesvara temple**

**Govinda III â€“ (Undated)**

This badly damaged inscription referring itself to the reign of **Prabbutavarsha** seems to record a gift of land. Since it is badly effaced and the details are lost, it is difficult to identify **Prabhutavarsha** of the record. On grounds of paleography, however, it may be ascribed to **Govinda III.**

**No. 12**

**(B.K. No. 68 of 1933-34)**

**Konnur, Naragund Taluk, Dharwar District**

**Slab set up in the Paramesvara temple**

**Amoghavarsha I-A. D. 860**

This inscription referring itself to the reign of **Amoghavarsha,** is dated in **Saka 782 expired (or 783 current), Vikrama, Asvina, Purnima, lunar eclipse.** The date corresponds to **A.D. 860, October 3, Thursday.**

It records that **Amoghavarsha,** residing at his capital **Manyakheta,** granted the village of Taleyuru and some land in other villages to the Jaina sage **Devendra,** the disciple of **Trikalayogisa,** of *Pustakayachchha, Desiya-gana* and *Mula-samgha.* The grant was made at the request of the officer **Bankesa** of the **Sellaketana** family.

The record is engraved in characters of about the **11-12^(th) century A.D.,** and it is stated to have been the copy of a copper-plate grant got rewritten by **Viranandi,** at the request of **Huliyamarasa,** the *mahaprabhu* of **Kolanura** and others. The inscription gives a detailed genealogy of **Viranandi.** The record is published in *Epigraphia Indica.*

**No. 13**

**(B.K. No. 70 of 1933-34)**

**Chinchli, Gadag Taluk, Dharwar District**

**Broken slab set up in the backyard of Hosahattiâ€™s house**

**Amoghavarsha I-A. D. 866**

This badly damaged and worn out inscription **Amoghavarsha.** Only the following details of the date, *viz.,* **Vyaya, Jyeshtha** and **grahana** are preserved. The year **Vyaya** coincided with **A.D. 866-67,** when Amoghavarsha I was ruling. It also coincided with A. D. 927. But in this year, there was no eclipse in the month of Jyeshtha.
In **A.D. 866,** however, there was a solar eclipse in Hyeshtha, *i.e.,* on **June 16, Sunday.** This probably is the intended date. Hence this record may be assigned to **Amoghavarsha I.** The mention of **Devannayya** strengthenes this surmise for it is known from other records that Devannayya was governing **Belvola Three hundred** when **Amoghavarsha I** was ruling. It also mentions **Kundeya-setti** and the village **Chinchala.**
