**BOMBAY KARNATAKA INSCRIPTIONS**

**VOLUME III**

**The Kalachuryas**

There area a few noteworthy inscriptions of the **Kalachuryas** who usurped the Chalukya throne for a short time. One of them (No. 176) is rather intriguing has much as it would seem to fix the initial year of the reign of **Bijjala** in A.D. 1150 though according to all other records which reckon his regnal years, the first year of his reign has been held to be A.D. 1156-57. In this record the date is given as follows: First year of the reign of Vira-Tribhuvanamalla Bijjala, Pramadicha, the full-moon day of the month of Sravana, Thursday. But the cyclic year Pramadicha coincided with A.D. 1133 by which time Bijjala could not have come to power, for the earliest date known for him even as a subordinate of the Chalukyas is A.D. 1142[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_18/the_kalachuryas.html#_ftn1).
The details of the date also do not work out correctly for this cyclic year. On the other hand, if the cyclic year Pramadicha is regarded as a mistake for Pramoduta (Pramoda) the given details would correspond regularly to A.D. 1150, August 10, Thursday. If this was the intended date, Bijjala should be considered to have been independent on this date and as this year is cited as the first year of his reign, it follows that he usurped the Chalukya throne before this date. But, as stated above, he seems to have counted his regnal years from A.D. 1156-57 in which year he is believed to have thrown off the yoke of Chalukya subordination. We have however no means of verifying the statement of the present record.

Another inscription (No. 180) declared that he was on the throne in A.D. 1168. However, as remarked by Fleet, Bijjala should have abducted the throne in favor of his son Sovideva in A.D. 1167. But as indicated by the Balagamve inscription as well as the present one he should have continued to take an active part in the governance of the country even after abdication. This view is further corroborated by an inscription (No. 186) of the time of Sovideva himself wherein Bijjala is spoken of as being engaged in putting down the insurgents.

Before Bijjalaâ€™s son **Sovideva** ascended the throne, **Mailugi** and **Karna** ruled for a short while. According to one of the records under publication (No. 296) this Karna was the grandson of Mailugi and Karnaâ€™s uncle (*kiriyayya i.e.,* younger paternal uncle) was Soma, *i.e.,* Sovideva is given as Kandaradeva andKalideva; and while Sovideva is stated to be the paternal uncle (*anu-tata*) of Kandara who was the grandson of Bijjala, Kalideva is termed the grandson of Mailugi, who was the younger brother of Bijjala. It would therefore appear that Karna, Kandaradeva and Kalideva are identical. But the apparent discrepancy in Kandaradeva being called the grandson of Bijjala, and Karna or Kalideva being called the grandson of Mailugi, the younger brother of Bijjala, can easily be explained, for its is a common Hindu practice to call a brotherâ€™s son as â€œsonâ€? and the brotherâ€™s grandson as â€œgrandsonâ€?. It cannot be definitely said, however, whether Karna was actually the grandson of Mailugi or Bijjala.

This inscription is dated in the **1^(st) year** of the reign of **Tribhuvanamalla Bijjaladeva, Pramadicha, Sravana su. Purnima, Thursday.** This cyclic year **Pramadicha** which coincided with A.D. 1133, takers the beginning of Bijjalaâ€™s reign to as early a date as A.D. 1133. But we have no other evidence to corroborate this. So it is likely that *Pramadicha* is a mistake for *Pramoduta* which coincided with A.D. 1150. In that year the details correspond regularly to **A.D. 1150, August 10, Thursday.**

It states that **Kundaya** and others made a gift of land to god **Svayambhu Chandesvaradeva.** Mention is made of **Masaneya-Sahani.**

**No. 177**

**(B.K. No. 10 of 1932-33)**

**Devageri, Haveri Taluk, Dharwar District**

**Broken slab built into the tirtha-kunda in the temple of Yellamma**

**Bijjala â€“ A.D. 1160**

This is damaged inscription refers itself to the reign of **Tribhuvanaikavira Bijjanadeva** and is dated in **1082** (apparently of the Sake era), **Vikrama, Chaitra su 1, Monday, Uttarayana-samkranti.** The date is irregular. The *tithi* corresponds to **A.D. 1160, March 10, Thursday,** not Monday as stated in the record and there was no *Uttatrayana* *samkranti* on that day.

**No. 178**

**(B.K. No. 175 of 1933-34)**

**Kannur, Bijapur Taluk, Bijapur District**

**Slab in the Pattadadevara Hirematha**

**Bijjala â€“ A.D. 1163**

This inscription is dated in the **7^(th) regnal year of Tribhuvanamalla Bij\[I\]aladeva, Subhanu, Pushya su.\[8\], Monday, solar eclipse.** Evidently the date is wrong.
