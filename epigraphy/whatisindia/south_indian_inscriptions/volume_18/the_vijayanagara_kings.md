**BOMBAY KARNATAKA INSCRIPTIONS**

**VOLUME III**

**The Vijayanagara Kings**

Only one of the inscriptions (No. 274) belonging to the first dynasty of the rulers of **Vijayanagara** is of any interest. It is dated Saka 1317 (A.D. 1396) in the reign of **Harihara II** who is herein stated to be â€˜reigning over the earthâ€™ with his minister **Mangappa-Dandanatha.** It records the death of Jaina **Mallappa** and others by the rite of *samadhi.* The record says that Mallappa was the *senadhipati* of **Madhava,** the governor of **Goa.** It further adds that Mallappaâ€™s father **Sankhadeva** had married the daughter of **Baicha-Heggade of Kommata.** Mangapa-Dandanatha and Madhava are well known as the officers of Harihara II; but the fact that Mallappaâ€™s mother was the daughter of Baicha-Heggade was not known before.

**Harihara II(?) â€“ A.D. 1402(?)**

This inscription referring itself to the reign of **Harihararaya** is dated in â€¦..**bhanu, Jyeshtha ba. 11 Sunday.** The partially preserved cyclic year â€¦.*bhanu* may be taken either as *Chitrabhanu* or *Svabhanu* and both these year occur in the reigns of Harihara I and Harihara II. But this may not belong to the reign of Harihara I since it is unlikely that during the short period after the founding of the kingdom his record could be found at a place so far removed from the capital.

During the reign of Harihara II, neither in *Chitrabhanu* nor *Svabhanu* *Jyeshtha ba. 11* fell on Sunday. In the former, however, it fell on Saturday; and it this can be taken as the date intended, it would correspond to **A.D. 1402 May 27 Saturday.**
