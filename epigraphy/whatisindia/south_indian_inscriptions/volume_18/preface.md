**BOMBAY KARNATAKA INSCRIPTIONS**

**VOLUME III**

**PREFACE**

This volume continues the series of South Indian Inscriptions known till now as the Bombay-Karnatak Inscriptions. It contains 462 inscriptions in all collected by the Epigraphical Branch during the years 1932-33, 1933-34 and 1934-35, from the districts of Bijapur and Dharwar of the former Bombay State. These epigraphs almost all of which are in Kannada, deal with various ruling and feudatory dynasties that held sway over Karnataka from the 7^(th) century onwards. When I was appointed Special Officer (Epigraphy) by the Government of India in May 1956, Shri A. Ghost the Director General of Archaeology in India, was pleased do depute Dr. B. Ch. Chhabra, Deputy Director General, to assign me work.
Dr. Chhabra entrusted to me the editing of the inscriptions contained in this volume and he was so kind as to allow me many facilities for which I am very grateful to him. Dr. D.C Sircar who was the Government Epigraphist for India then was kind enough to give me the necessary clerical and other assistance. Here I must make special mention of the untiring technical assistance rendered by my hard working and conscientious assistant Shri. S. H. Ritti, M.A. The results of fourteen months of hard work are embodied in this volume and it is hoped that this will prove helpful to scholars of Indology, Kannada Language and Literature and Karnataka History.
