**[Taila II, Irivabedanga Satyasraya, Jayasimha II](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_18/taila_2_irivabedanga_satyasraya_jayasimha_2.html) \| [Somesvara I & II](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_18/somesvara_1_somesvara_2.html) [Vikramaditya VI](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_18/vikramaditya_6.html) \| [Somesvara III, Jagadekamalla II](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_18/somesvara_3_jagadekamalla_2.html)**

**[Taila III, Somesvara IV](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_18/taila_3_somesvara_4.html)**

Of Taila II, who restored the Chalukya sovereignty after overthrowing the Rashtrakutas, we have two records in this volume. One of them (No. 40) dated aka 915 (A.D. 994) says that he was ruling from his capital Manyakheda. This would show that Manyakheda (modern Malkhed), which was formerly the capital of the Rashtrakutas, continued to enjoy that position for some time after the Chalukyas made Kalyana their capital.
The second inscription (No. 41) which is dated Saka 918 (A.D. 996) indicates that the title *Bhuvanaikamalla* was applied to the prince **Dasavarma** who, me know, was a son of Taila. This title was not known to have been given to him so far.

In the inscriptions of **Jayasimha II** three wives of **Kundaraja,** who is described as â€˜the sonâ€™ of Irivabedanga, are mentioned. They are **Jogabbarasi, Kundaladevi** and **Pampadevi.** Jogabbarasi is stated to have been managing the village of Ajjadi in Saka 941 (A.D. 1019) (No. 44). Kundaladevi was governing Banavasi Twelve-thousand and Payve-nadu conjointly with her husband in Saka 950 (A.D. 1028) (No. 47). No. 52, the date of which is lost, states that Pampadevi was administering the village of Jidugur. It is interesting to observe that while one of the ladies was sharing the governance of the province with her husband, the other two were independently administering two villages.

Another inscription of Jayasimha which gives some new information regarding the chiefs of the Matura family may be notice here. This record (No. 43) of A.D. 1017, gives the names of the chiefs of this family for five generations. But their relation with one another is not definite in all cases on account of the damaged condition of the record. They are: **Dosi, Sinda, Santivarma, Payyara,** his wife **Charakabbe** and their son **Siriyagara.** We know that two members of this family namely, Machiyarasa and Santivarma, were holding responsible positions under the Rashtrakutas in the 10^(th) century A.D. Since Santivarmaâ€™s dates range from A.D. 972 to 992, it is not improbable that he is not different from the Santivazrma of the present record. It may not be out of place to mention here another member of this family, namely, Vijayaditya, who was a subordinate of Vikramaditya VI in the A.D. 1088 (No. 93). In addition to Vijayaditya this record speaks of Siriyagaradeva who by his name appears to be also of ht Mature family. The earliest notice of this family seems to be found in a record of 9^(th) century A.D. of a Rashtrakuta king, whose name and date are lost (No. 38). The name of this family is spelt as Mattara in that record.

Among the exploits of Kundaraja recounted in one of the inscriptions (No. 44) the following are noteworthy. He is stated to have undertaken to burn the (city of) Muggeri, to humble the pride of Mummuni and to force the lord of Kanyakubja to flee to the Himalayas. It is difficult to identify the Mummuni mentioned here. The earliest date we have for the only Mummuni we know of , is A.D. 1049. He is the Silahara prince of Northern Konkan. Since the record under review is of A.D. 1019, it cannot be ascertained if the two Mummunis are identical.

Of the inscriptions of **Somesvara I,** No. 68, dated Saka 985 (A.D. 1062), mentions **Indrakesiyarasa** of the **Manaleyara** lineage as a *manneya.* Evidently he is identical with Indrakesi, who is stated in the Prince of Wales Museum record to have made a grant of land in A.D. 1060. Thus the present record would extend his period by two years.

Another feudatory of a well-known family is referred to in No. 66. He is *Mahamandalesvara* **Toyiladeva** of the **Kadamba** dynasty (of Hangal), who was governing banavasi Twelve-thousand and Panungal Five-hundred in Saka 984 (A.D. 1062). Though this name is not found among the already know members of this family, it is not improbable that he is the same as Toyimadeva, the son of king of Somesvaraâ€™s aunt Akkadevi, for he (Toyimadeva) was governing the same divisions in A.D. 1064. It may be noted here that at the time of making the grant recorded in this inscription, Toyiladeva was residing in the camp (*irke-vidu*) of **Payitthana.** This information is interesting as it would show that Payitthana (Pratishthana) which was the capital of the Satavahanas as early as the 1^(st) century B.C. continued to be an important place even in the 11^(th) century A.D.

*Mahamandalesvara* **Mararasa** who was governing Belvola Three-hundred from Annigere, as a subordinate of Somesvara I, bore the title *Cholangonda* (No. 70). From another undated record of the same reign, it is seen that one of the deities at Annigere had the name of Cholangonda-Traipurushadeva, apparently because it was installed by Cholangonda-Mararasa. This title *Cholangonda* no doubt refers to one of the victories gained against the Cholas by Somesvara during a series of encounters that took place in his reign between him and the Cholas.

The inscription of **Somesvara II** published in this volume do not add much to our knowledge of his reign . However one of them (No. 74) contains one or two items of useful information. It introduces an officer named **Madhuvarasa** who was the *Kannada-sandhivigrahi* and *Dandanayaka* of the king. He bears a number of epithets among which *Visalar-ankusa* is noteworthy. Evidently he acquired title after success in some conflict with his adversary, named **Visala.** We know that a ruler named Visala of the imperial Chahamana dynasty flourished about this period, He may be placed in A.D. 1070 since he had married Rajadevi, a daughter of the Paramara king Bhoja (*circa.* A.D. 1010-1055). From one other epithet of Madhuvarasa., *viz., Chalukya-rajy-abhyudaya-karana* it may be gathered that he played an important part in firmly establishing the Chalukya suzerainty, apparently by quelling the disturbances which, occurred during this period.
