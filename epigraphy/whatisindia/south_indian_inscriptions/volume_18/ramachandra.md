**Ramachandra-A.D. 1277**

This inscription is dated in the **7^(th) year** of the reign of **Ramachandradeva, Isvara, Kartika su., Thursday.** The *tithi* is lost. In the cyclic year *Isvara* there were two *Kartikas* and in the *suddha-paksha* of both the months the following *tithis* occurred on Thursdays.

*Adhika-kartika Su. 2 =* **A.D. 1277,** September 30.

Do Su. 9 = Do October 7.

*Nija-Kartika* Su. 8 *=* Do November 4

Do Su. 16 = Do. Do. 11

In the absence of the exact *tithi*, it is difficult to find out the equivalent. It states that \[**Talli**\]-Nayaka **son of \[Na\]geya-Rahuta** died in a battle. The record is much damaged.
