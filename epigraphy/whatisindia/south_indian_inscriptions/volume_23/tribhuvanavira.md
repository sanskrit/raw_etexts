The king is here called Tribhuvanaviradeva â€˜who performed the anointment of heroes and victors after having taken Madurai, Ilam, Karuvur and the crowned head of the Pandya.â€™ The details of the date given viz., Rishabha, ba. 10, Monday, Uttirattadi would give the equivalent A.D. 1211, May 6.

The king is called Tribhuvanaviradeva â€˜who took Madurai, Ilam (and Karuvur) and the crowned head of the Pandya, and performed the anoitment (of heroes and victors)â€™. The inscription is much damaged in the first half. It seems to register an endowment of land by one Tirunattapperuman a resident of Anaichchul in Tiramur-nadu a division of Uyyakkondar-valanadu for the requirements of worship, both daily and special, to god Tiruvenkadudaiyar consecrated by the donor in the western portion of the first prakara in the temple of Tiruvidaikkulam-udaiyar at the place. This seems to have been added to two veli of land at Danavinodanallur presented to the main temple in the 25th year of the king by Arayan Edirillisolar alias Soliyavaraiyar of Palaivayal under the name Soliyavaraiyar-kudikkadu and supplemented by the latter with another gift of one veli of land in the next year. It is not clear why there was an interval of 14 years between the gift and its recording on stone.

The donor was evidently a member of the Ganga family of chiefs of Kolar who were subordinate to the Chola and should have been related to, if not identical with, Amarabharanan Siyagangan figuring in No. 10 of 1893 and No. 195 of 1892 (An.

The details of date are given as 7th year, Makara, su. 14, Monday, Uttiram.Makara, su. 14 can never combine with Uttiram. The intended date was probably A.D. 1152, January 21, f.d.t. 80, the Nakshatra on this day being Purarvasu. The inscription is damaged with portions lost. It seems to register a grant of land by the assembly of Rajasraya-chaturvedimangalam in Uraiyur-kurram for the expenses of daily worship and of a festival in the month of Vaigasi in the temple of Tiru-Udaitalai-Mahadeva at Tiru-Uraiyur.

**(*A. R*. No. 291 of 1907)**

**Tiruvidaimarudur, Kumbhakonam Taluk, Tanjavur District**

**Mahalingasvami temple â€“ in the same place**

**Rajarajadeva III : year 27 : 1243-44 A.D.**

**Mahalingasvami temple â€“ on the second eastern *gopura***

**right of entrance**

**Rajarajadeva \[III\] : year 6+1**

A few syllables at the end of each line are inaccessible and the inscriptions also damaged. It seems to register an order of the king confiscating the land belonging to some persons who proved traitorous (to the king ?) and distributing them, some by way of auction (Rajarajapperuvilai) and some by sale at estimated price. The details are not clear. However, the temple of Tiruvidaimarududaiyar is mentioned as having purchased some land in auction. Reference is made to Tillai-ambala-chaturvedimangalam as the tirunamattukkani and \[devadana ?\]-iraiyili of God Tiruchchirrambalam-Udaiyar, \[Nataraja\] and his consort Tirukkamakkottam-udaiya-Periyanachchiyar. Some bhatta-vritti lands at Tirubhuvanavira-chaturvedimnagalam are also referred to as having been granted as Sodakumba (for the merit of the dead king) of Periyadevar evidently meaning Kulottunga-Chola III who was known by the other name Tribhuvanaviradeva.

Could the treachery referred to above be a symptom of the kingâ€™s weakness that contributed to his serious trouble later in his life?

**Mayuram, Mayuram Taluk, Tanjavur District**

The land was exempted from the taxes like antarayam and pattam by the adaippu-mudalis (?) and the mahasabha of the village (Nallor-Pudukkudi) in which the land was situated.

**No. 388**

**(Page No 281)**

**(*A. R.* No. 388 of 1907)**

**Maruttuvakkudi, Kumbhakonam Taluk, Tanjavur District**

**Airavatesvara temple â€“ on the same wall**

**Konerinmaikondan : year 21**

This may also be an inscription of Rajaraja III, whose order issued on the 274th day of the year quoted, through the Tirumandiravoai Minavan-Muvendavelan to his officers and to the temple, grants ulvari for some land given tax-free for the expenses of worship. Like No. 387 above, this also quotes the 40th year of the previous king. The details of the transaction are lost owing to the badly damaged state of the record.

**No. 389**

**(Page No 283)**

**(*A. R.* No. 389 of 1907)**

**Maruttuvakkudi, Kumbhakonam Taluk, Tanjavur District**

**Airavatesvara temple â€“ on the same wall**

This is dated in the 21st year evidently of the same king (Rajaraja III). The king whose 40th year is quoted in the foregoing records is here clearly referred to as Periyadevar Tribhuvanaviradeva (Kulottunga Chola III). This is the ulvari document as finally executed and incised on the wall by order of the king, specifying the remission of taxes in the Registers on the 11 veli and odd of land with its income of 476 kalam of paddy mentioned in No. 387 above.

**No. 391**

**Maruttuvakkudi, Kumbhakonam Taluk, Tanjavur District**

**Airavatesvara temple â€“ on the same wall**

**\[Rajaraja III\] year 21 : 1236-37 A.D.**

The assessment of some lands made in the 40th year of Periyadevar Tribhuvanaviradevar is referred to in this record also as in No. 389 above. This is dated in the 260th day of the regnal year quoted and is connected with No. 388 which is 14 days later. It is however curious to note that this earlier document is the actual ulvari document of execution of the other record. Though the lacunae of the damaged portion of the later are partly filled up the present inscription a connected account of the transaction cannot be clearly made out. Of the two pieces of land granted as devadana-iraiyili to the temple of Tiruvidaikkulam-Udaiyar, one is stated to be situated in the village Irumarabuntuya peruman-\[chaturvedimangalam\] in Kurumbur-nadu and the other in Kulottungasolan-Nyaya-paripala-chaturvedi-mangalam in Tiraimur-nadu. In connection with each of these lands are also mentioned the villages Sembiyan-Nerkuppai a part of Tiraimur alias Ulaguyyakkondasola-chaturvedimangalam in Vilai-nadu, a division of Jayagondasola-valanadu and Vikramasola-chaturvedimangalam (No.388) \[in Tiraimur-nadu?\], from the accounts of which these lands are said to have been separated.

**Agastyesvara temple â€“ on another slab set up**

**in the same place**

**Tribh. Rajaraja (III). Year 21 : 1236-37 A.D.**

The cyclic year Durmukhi corresponding to the 21st regnal year of the king makes the inscription one of Rajaraja III. The record states that a certain Isanadevar, an *andar* looking after the flower garden of Tiruvagattisvaram-udaiya-Nayanar at Gundalur in Pottappi-nadu which was a subdivision of Merpakkai-nadu, died by taking the alari plant poison probably under suspicious circumstances. On an order received from Kunrapillaiyar Gandagopalan, the Nattavar and the officers with the Mahesvaras of the temple made enquiries into the matter and punished the culprits responsible for the mishap. The manraduvar (assembly) of Gundalur undertook to burn a perpetual lamp in the temple for the merit of the deceased and the sons of the latter were to pay a third of the expense.

This registers a sale of 2 adjacent house-sites measuring 3 *kol* and 9 *kol* east to west with a depth of 14 *kol* situated on the north side of the *tirumadai vilagam* of the temple of Tiruchchattimurram-Udaiyar at Kil-Palaiyaru *alias* Rajarajapuram in Kulottungasola-valanadu to a *matha* at that place belonging to the lineage of Meynanasivar, for 700 *kasu* by the temple of Sonnavararivar.

**No. 580**

**(Page No 400)**

**Saumyanatha temple â€“ on the 5^(th) tier of the north base, the north and**

**West walls of the same *mandapa* and the north wall of the central shrine**

**Rajendra-Chola III year 13 : 1257-58 A.D.**

The inscription is also dated in Saka 1179, Pingala, Mesha-Sankranti. It is written in three languages, the gift part being in Sanskrit ; the next comprising mostly of the names of the donees with the number of their shares of land, is in Telugu but in Grantha alphabet like the first part ; and the last portion of about 20 lines, giving the main gist of the record is in Tamil. The epigraph begins with a eulogy of a king by name Trinetra (Trilochana-Pallava ?) who founded many agraharas to the east of the Tripurantaka hill. A successor of his of the same name â€“ Mukkanti-Kaduvetti established and gave the village Perungandur in Paschima-Paka-nadu a division of Adhirajendra-Chola-mandalam to 52 Brahmanas in Saka 723 (mistake for Saka 730 ?), Sarvadhari, Mesha-Sankramana, ba. 6, Wednesday, Mula (A.D. 808, March 21 , Tuesday ?). The donees were in enjoyment of their shares for a long time, when some Velumas from Inumbrolu escaping from the mari-jvaram of their place, settled in fields near them, agreeing to pay rents for their lands, along-side the residents of Sakali-Kodura who had also emigrated from their place on account of some riots. During a famine that followed the Brahmanas left their places and when they returned found themselves supplanted in their possessions by the new comers who had in the meantime named their new settlement as Koduru, and refused to give the rent due to the Brahmana landlords. The latter then made a representation to the chief Manumasiddhi, whose genealogy is here introduced viz Dayabhima, Betabhupa, Erasiddhi, Manmasiddha, and Tikkanripa the father of the ruling chief. This Manumasiddhi is said to have conquered a chief named Vijaya and tried to secure the friendship of Kakatiya-Ganapati by fighting a battle for him on the banks of the Godavari. He was a feudatory under the Chola king Rajendra-Chola III whose regnal year is quoted.

Manumasiddhi sent for the cultivators against whom the complaint was made and after due enquiry with witnesses, decided the case in favour of the dispossessed Brahmanas, to whom he renewed the grant of the village Koduru for the merit of his father. Then follows a detailed list of all the share-holders, in Telugu. The concluding portion of the inscription which is in Tamil registers an order of Madurantaka-Pottappi-Chola Manumasiddhi, granting the village Koduru a hamlet of Perungandur to the Brahmanas, thus restoring their ancient possessions, when the inhabitants from Inumbudol (Inumbrolu) could not prove their case.
