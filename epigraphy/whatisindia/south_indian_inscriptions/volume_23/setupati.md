**No. 397**



**(Page No 297)**

**(*A. R.* No. 397 of 1907)**

**Kilakkarai, Ramnad Taluk, Ramnad District**

**Chokkanathasvami temple â€“ on a slab set up in the premises**

**Tirumalai Setupati-Maharaja (1645- to 1670 A.D.)**

The inscription is damaged. It seems to register a gift of village (by the chief) for the expenses of worship to god Minakshi Sundaresvarar at Kilaikkarai *alias* Ninaittadu-muditta-Vinayakar-pattinam.
