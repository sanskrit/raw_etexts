**Kanippakkam , Chittoor Taluk, Chittoor district**

**Manikanthesvara temple --- on the east wall of the central shrine**

This is dated in the 8th year of the Chola king Virarajendra-Choladeva (Kulottunga III ) and in saka 1108 (A.D. ) 1186-87) , Panguni. It is built in the middle. It records a gif of a kalanju of gold for burning a twilight lamp in the temple of Manikanthesvaram-Udaiyar by one I laraiyan Sagararajan Siyagangan. The donor was evidently a member of the Ganga family of chiefs of Kolar who were subordinate to the Chola and should have been related to, if not identical with, Amarabharanan Siyagangan figuring in No. 10 of 1893 and No. 195 of 1892 (An. Rept. for 1893, para 8), and also in a Tiruvallam inscription (S.I.I. Vol. III, p. 122) as a feudatory of Kulotunga, and who was the patron of Pavanandi the author of the Tamil Grammar Nannul.

**(Page No 36)**

**(A. R. No. 60 of 1907)**

**Kanippakkam, Chittoor Taluk, Chittoor District**

**On the north wall of the same shrine**

This is an incomplete inscription dated in the 12^(th) regnal year of Kulottunga-chola III and in Saka 1102 corresponding to A.D. 1180. Since Kulottunga is known to have ascended the throne in Saka 1100 the regnal year 12 must correspond to Saka 1112 and not to Saka 1102. The details of date given in the record viz.Uttarayana-Sankrama, Monday, Pushya would then give the equivalent A.D. 1189, December 25.The inscription stops with the mention of Vellalan Tengurudai\[yan\*\] an officer under Suranayakan Siyagangan â€˜the lord of Kuvalalapura born in the family of the Gangaâ€™.The reference is very probably to Sagararajan of No. 57 above.
