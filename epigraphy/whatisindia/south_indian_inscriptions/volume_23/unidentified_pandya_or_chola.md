**Konerinmaikondan**

## **No. 105**

**(Page No 69)**

**(*A. R.* No. 105 of 1907)**

**Kallidaikkurichchi, Ambasamudram Taluk, Tirunelveli District**

**Kiri-Krishnan temple-on the same wall.**

This inscription begins with the expression â€˜Konerinmaikondanâ€™-the unequalled an honorific title of the reigning king, and is dated in the 6^(th) year and 147^(th) day of his reign. This records a royal order issued to the assembly of Rajaraja-chatur-vedimangalam to the effect, that an addition was to be made to the *tiruvidaiyattam* lands already endowed to the temple of Nalayira-Vinnagar built (?) by one Karumanikkalvan *alias* Venavudaiyan, so that a daily service called *Avanivendaraman-sandi* after the king could be conducted in the temple, in addition to special worship to the god on all the days of his natal star Uttirattadi during the 12 months of the year. Venavudaiyan was to be shown certain honours on these occasions.

## **No. 106**

**(Page No 70)**

***(A. R.* No. 106 of 1907)**

**Kallidaikkurichchi, Ambasamudram Taluk, Tirunelveli District**

**Kiri-Krishnan temple-on the same wall**

This is also dated in the same year and day of the kingâ€™s reign as the above and registers an undertaking given by the assembly that they would not in future collect the taxes on the tiruvidaiyattam lands since they had been declared tax-free by royal flat.

## **No. 109**

**(Page No 72)**

**(*A. R.* No. 109 of 1907)**

**Kallidaikkurichchi, Ambasamudram Taluk, Tirunelveli District**

**Kiri-Krishnan temple-on the north wall of the central shrine**

This is an inscription of the 3+1+1st years (expressed also as the 3rd year and 1072nd day ) of king Kulasekharadeva with his title Konerinmaikondan. It records the transfer, by order of the king, of the kadamai and uludankudi (tax and rent?) on the karanmai lands at Pappankulam belonging to the temple of Nalayira Vinnagar Emberuman at Kalladaikkurichchi, which had been originally granted to one Sundara-Pandya â€“Malayarayan by Sokkaiyan (king Sundara-Pandya?) in favour of the temple itself. The inscription registers both the royal order to get the document engraved on stone and copper and its actual execution by the temple, represented by eleven temple executives after it was communicated to them by the maha-sabha of Rajaraja-chaturvedimangalam.

## **No. 120**

**(Page No 85)**

**(*A. R.* No. 120 of 1907)**

**Alvarkurichchi, Ambasamudram Taluk, Tirunelveli District**

**Avudaiyamman temple --- on the north wall of the central shrine**

This begins with the signature of Sundara-Pandya Kalingarayar evidently an officer of the king whose order he communicates to the sthanikas of the temple of Narasinga-Isavaramudaiya-Nayanar, granting a land tax-free at Pannangudi for the daily worship and offering to the goddess consecrated as Tiruppalliyarai-Nach-chiyar in the temple by a Sivabrahmana by name Tiruttodalagiyan. This latter was given the right of worship of the deity. The inscription is dated in the 6th year of the king under title Konerinmaikondan. It is possible that it might refer to king Maravarman Sundara-Pandya I. Alvarkurichchi is called here by the name Kollamkonda-Pandya-chaturvedimangalam.

## **No. 121**

**(Page No 86)**

**(*A. R.* No. 121 of 1907)**

**Alvarkurichchi, Ambasamudram Taluk, Tirunelveli District**

**vanniyappar temple --- on the north wall of the central shrine**

This is an incomplete inscription. It records a gift of land tax-free as Karanmai-devadanam at Kaderu, by which name probably Alvarkurchchi was them known, the north western quarter of Rajaraja-chaturvedimangalam in Mulli-nadu, worship to the diety. The kingâ€™s name is not given, only his title Konerinmaikondan, and the regnal year is lost. A tax mentioned incidentally-- perhaps under exemption is the one on the devaradiyar living in the tirimadaivilagam of the temple.
