**INSCRIPTIONS COLLECTED DURING THE YEAR 1906-07**

**INTRODUCTION**

## PANdyas

16\. The most noteworthy feature of the year was the examination of the contents of the contents of the Velvikkudi grant and the Madras Museum Plates of Nedunjadaiyan Parantaka with those of the Sinnamanur Plates Plates of Rajasimha II, and the construction of a genealogy and connected account of the Early Pandya kings of Madurai who flourished between the 7^(th) and 10^(th) centuries A.D. some stone inscriptions of Baragana-Maharaja and kings known only by their surnames Maran sadaiyan or Sandaiyamaran which were copied during the year also belong to about the same period. All these inscriptions have been published elsewhere (S.I.I. Vol. XIV) and are referred to here only by way of information.

17\. The next king after Rajasimha II, and probably his successor, was Virapandya who claims to have taken the head of the Chola. This adversary has been surmised to be no other than the great Parantaka I himself, whose death was avenged later by his descendant prince Aditya II Karikala about A.D. 966 (Ep.*Ind.,* Vol. XXV, No.6). The period that followed the demise of Vira-pandya was one of Chola Suzerainty over the Panday Kingdom, and it is known that for at least 50 years from A.D. 1020, it was being governed by Chola viceroys under the title Chola-pandya. Though under subjection the pandya seem to have continued to rule over parts of their territory, and the period is marked by constant and prolonged warfare either against their Chola overlords or among the rival Pandya prince themselves, as can be gathered from disconnected scraps of information found in Chola records. With the beginning of the 12^(th) century A.D. the Cholas seem to have gradually lost their hold on the Pandyas, and we find inscriptions of **Jatavarma srivallabha,** a younger contemporary of Kulottunga-chola I, whose date of accession has been fixed between A.D. 1120 and 1122, and whose rule seems to have been confined to a small tract comprising portions of Madurai, Ramnad and Tirunelveli district. (S.I.I., Vol. XIV, *Intr.* P. VI). To this king may perhaps be ascribed No. 507 of the yearâ€™s collection from Madirai .

18\. Then came the war of Pandya succession in the 3^(rd) quarter of the century, in which the choals and the Ceylonese king took opposite sides supporting the claims of rival prince to the throne, and which continued for a number of years. Prof. K. A. N. Sastri in his Pandyam Kingdom, thus sums up the final pahse of this war: whatever happened to Vira-pandya and his relatives, it seems clear that Kullotunga (III) succeeded in establishing Vikrama-pandya on the Pandya throne and thus putting an end to all disputes about the succession in which the Cholas and the Ceylon Kings had taken sides for over a decade. But it is not yet possible to ascribe any inscriptions with confidence to this Vikrama-pandya, and we cannot say if he was the immediate predecessor or not of Jatavaraman Kulasekhara who came to the throne of the Pandyas in A.D. 1190.

There are two inscriptions in the yearâ€™s collection which can be definitely assigned to this king. Nos.90 and 97 (A) from Kallidaikkurichchi in the Tirunelveli district are both dated in the 7+4^(th) year of **Maravarmaa Vikrama-pandya** beginning with the introduction Tirumagal Jayamagal ect. One of these register a sale of some land by the assembly of Rajaraja-chaturvedimangalam to the temple of Nilaiyudaiya-pandya-Isvarmudaiyar at Kallidaikkurichchi and the other, the sale of another piece of land to the temple of Nalayira-Isvaramudauyar in the same place. The taxes on these lands were remitted in the 9+4^(th) year of **Jatavarma kulasekhara** as recorded in Nos. 91and 97 on the representation made by his minister Kalingarayar, thus showing the very close proximity in time of these two kings. This seems to receive support from an epigraph of Kulasekhara from Tirunelveli (No. 83 of 1927) which refers to Vikramapandyadeva as *Periya-nayanar.*

The same epithet is given to king Srivallbha in No.110 of the 2^(nd) year Kulasekhara. But the way in which the reference is worded in the inscription seems to point to a much anterior time, and probably to the relationship of Srivallabha as father both to Maravarman Vikramapandya and Jatavaraman Kulasekhara I, the latter being the younger brother of the former.

19\. This **Jatavarman Kulasekhara** who came to power by A.D. 1190 is represented by a dozen inscriptions which begin with one of the three introductions *Pudalamadandai, Pudala-vanitai* or *Puvinkilatti,* ect., and range between the 2^(nd) and 25^(th) years of his reign (No.99) the earliest of these is No. 110 already quoted above which records the confirmation of the grant of a land made by the *Nagarattar* of
Kshatriyasikhamanipuram in Mulli-nadu to the Nalayira-Vinnagar temple at Kallidaikkurichchi, agreeing to pay the *kadamai* on the land themselves as they had been doingin the time of periyar-nayar Srivallabhadevar. In No. 152 of the kingâ€™s 3^(rd) year copied at Melaikkoyil ( Pudukkottai state), a chieftain of the region by name Kalvayil â€“nadalvan is stated to have remitted the taxes *kadamaarivi* and *antarayam* on a *devadana* village. Another important person of the reign was one Sivallavan Tirunilakantan *alias* Tondaiman of Pandimandalam who figures in three records from Sinnamanur (Nos. 445, 450 and 451). In No. 112 from Kallidaikkurichchi the king is mentioned as being seated on his throne **Munaiyadaraiyan** in his palace at Madurai while making a grant to the Vishnu temple at the village.

20\. Of **Maravarman Sundara-pandya** (acc.A.D.1216) there are 16 inscriptions from his 5^(th) year (No. 100) to his 23^(rd) (No.124). All of them except Nos. 124, 416 and 436 begin with only a short formula giving him the attributes â€œwho took the Chola countryâ€?, â€œwho presented the Chola countryâ€?, or â€œwho having taken the Chola country celebrated the anointmentofheroes at Mudigondasolapuram.â€? These three inscriptions commence with the long historical introduction
*Pumaruviya Tirumadandaiyam* ect., containing an account of all his military achievements culminating in his virabhisheka in the chola capital. No. 416 dated in his 17+1+1^(st) year mentions an officer of the king by name Alagapperumal Duvarapativelan. In No. 124 which is his latest record, mentions is made of his throne **Malavarayan** at Madurai and of his two minister Malavarayar and solan Uyyaninraduvan
Kurukulattaraiyan of Tadanganni Sirrur.
