**Betarasa**

**No. 583**

**(Page No 406)**

**(*A. R.* No. 583 of 1907)**

**Nandaluru, Rajampet Taluk, Cuddapah District**

**Saumyanatha temple â€“ on the 2^(nd) tier of the same base**

**\[Vikrama-Chola\]. Year 3 : 1120-21 A.D.**

The inscription is built in at the beginning and is also incomplete. The introduction is that beginning with words *Pumadu Punara*. It is dated in Saka 104\[2\], Sarvari, Chittirai-Vishu, when Mahamandalesvara Bettarasa was ruling Pottappi-nadu. The purport of the record is not clear except that the chief founded an *agrahara* for the success of the king's arms. Some reference is made to a parigraha (seizure ?) in which two or three minor chieftains seem to have been involved.

**Vimaladitya**

**No. 579**

**(Page No 397)**

**(*A. R.* No. 579 of 1907)**

**Nandaluru, Rajampet Taluk, Cuddapah District**

**Saumyanatha temple â€“ on the 2^(nd) and 3^(rd) tiers of the north base and**

**on the three tiers of the west base of the same *mandapa***

**Vikrama-Chola. Year 8, Saka 1047 Visvavasu : A.D. 1125-26**

The inscription begins with the introduction *Pumadu Punara* etc. This registers the gift of the village Mannur *alias* Vikramasola-chaturvedimangalam in Merpakkai-nadu, a division of Adhirajendramandalm, as an *agrahara* of 70 shares to several leanred Brahmanas, for securing success to the kingâ€™s arms, by the chief Mahamnadalesvara Vimaladityadeva who is stated to have been ruling Pottappi-nadu. He was the son of Siddharasa and was called Madhurantaka Pottappichchola. A list of all the donees is given with the number of shares each got, being specified.

**No. 584**

**(Page No 407)**

**(*A. R.* No. 584 of 1907)**

**Nandaluru, Rajampet Taluk, Cuddapah District**

**Saumyanatha temple â€“ on the 3^(rd) and 4^(th) tiers of the same base**

This is also in at the beginning. This seems to record the confirmation of a grant of lands made probably by Erasiddharasar some time previously to twenty Brahmanas, ten from the south and ten from the north â€“ settled in the *agrahara*, by the chiefâ€™s son Madhurantaka Pottappi Chola Vimaladitya on the day of Chittirai-Vishu.
