This is a Sanskrit inscription in early Grantha characters. It gives the genealogy of the family of Kodumbalur Chiefs. The first line is mutilated and hence the name of the original ancestor is not known. He is said to have captured an elephant battalion evidently from some enemy. In his family was born Paravirajit Viratunga; his son was Ativira, the unrivalled (anupama); his son was Sanghakrit to whom was born Nripakesari; his son was Paradurgamarddana, the glorious conqueror of Vatapi. To him was born Samarabhirama who killed Chalukki in a battle at Adhirajamangala. He married a princess was Bhuti who by his prowess in battle obtained the title Vikramakesari. He is stated to have made the waters of the Kaveri red with the blood of the Pallava army slain by him.. He also conquered Vira-pandya in battle and destroyed one Vanchi-Vel. It is stated that he was living at Kodumbalur with his two wives Karrali and Varaguna, by the former of whom he had two sons Parantakavarman and Adityavarman. This Bhuti Vikramakesari built three shrines in the name of himself and his two consorts for god Mahesvara at Kodumbalur, and presented a *matha* to Mallikarjuna of Madura, a teacher of the Kalamukha sect of Saivas and eleven villages for feeding 50 ascetics of that sect (every day).

Since this chief Bhuti Vikramakesari is known from other stone records to be identical with Tennavan Ilangovel a feudatory of Chola Aditya I, it is possible that the destruction of the Pallava army claimed by him was in connection with his liege-lord Adityaâ€™s overthrow of Pallava Aparajita in battle and his annexation of the latterâ€™s territory sometime before A.D. 890. In this case Vira-Pandya over whom also, Buti claims a victory cannot be equated with his namesake who was killed in fight by Aditya II Karikala (*vide An. Rept.* For 1908, Part II, para 88), because that event took place more than 70 years later. He should have been a contemporary of Parantaka Vira-Narayana and probably belonging to a collateral Pandya line as surmised by Mr. K.V.S. Aiyar (*Q.J.M.S*. Vol. *XLIII,* No.s 3 and 4.

**No. 134**

**(*A. R*. No. 134 of 1907)**

**Kodumbalur, Kulattur Taluk, Tiruchirappalli District**

**Muchukundesvara templeâ€”on the same wall**

This seems to be an unusual record-in faulty style-purporting to be an inscription dated in the 7^(th) year of a Kodumbalur chief Virasola-Irukkuvel with the Chola title Parakesarivarman prefixed to his name. It states that on the representation (made) to the chief) by Alagan Virasola-Anukkamal of the *udankuttam* (?), the kanmalur and some others (not clear) an image of the deity called Akkasalisvaram-Udai\[yar\] was consecrated in the temple of Tirumudugaram at Kodumbalur, and provision was made for its daily whorship and offerings by means of a gift of a land known as Seral-endal as devadana.
