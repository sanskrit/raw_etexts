**INSCRIPTIONS COLLECTED DURING THE YEAR 1906-07**

**NAYAKAS OF TANJAVUR**

**Sevvappa-Nayaka**

**No. 497**

**(Page No 378)**

**(*A. R.* No. 497 of 1907)**

**Svamimalai, Kumbhakonam Taluk, Tanjavur District**

**Subrahmanya temple â€“ in the same place**

**Sevappa-Nayaka. Saka 1495 : 1573-74 A.D.**

This is built in the middle and also incomplete. The first and second sections together seem to register a gift of 2 *veli* of land by Sevvappa-Nayakkar, son of Timmappa-Nayakkar of the Chaturtha-gotra and a native of Nedungunram in Tondai-mandalam to the temple of Kumarasvami at Svamimalai in Innambar-nadu Parantaka-nadu, a division of Vikramasola-valanadu of Tiruchchirappalli-chavadi for the abhisheka service of the god and for burning a â€˜ghee-lampâ€™ in the temple, and also for the maintenance of a *matha* called the Velayudhachchivan-madam.

A Third piece which seems to be part of another inscription is also found close by which mentions Timmugudi in Vembattur-sirmai and gift of a quarter *(veli*) of land for the *sandhi-abhisheka* (of the same god?) and for a lamp.

The date of the inscription (of sevappa-Nayaka) is given as Tula, su. Paurnamasi, Saturday, Asvati (=1573 A.D., October 10).
