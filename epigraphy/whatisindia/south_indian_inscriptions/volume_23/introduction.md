**INSCRIPTIONS COLLECTED DURING THE YEAR 1906-07**

**INTRODUCTION**

The collection of inscriptions of 1907 contained in this volume has been very kindly assigned to me by the Department for study and publication, and I gratefully acknowledge the help and encouragement given to me in this connection by the Government Epigraphist for India.

Of the 623 inscriptions copied during this year, 175 have been included in the previous publications. These comprise 34 Brahmi inscriptions from Amaravati in the Guntur district published in the *Epigraphia Indica*, Vol.XV; 25 Pallava inscriptions from Mahabalipuram published already in S.I.I. Vol. I; 20 Early Pandya and Chola-Pandya records included in the volume of Pandya Inscriptions (S.I.I. Vol. XIV); a dozen Telugu and Kannada epigraphs of the Kakatiya and Vijayanagara kings; and lastly 84 Chola inscriptions of kinds bearing the surnames Rajakesarivarman and Parakesarivarman (S. I. I. Vols. XII and XIX). The originals of 3 inscriptions viz., Nos. 211, 270 and 503 are lost, but they are not of much importance. The present volume contains the texts of 445 inscriptions belonging mostly to the Chola and Medieval Pandya kings.
Of the rest some refer themselves to the reigns of the Vijayanagara rulers and their feudatories, and some to the minor dynasties of chiefs like the Pottapi-Chods, the Kodumbalur chiefs etc., while a good number are miscellaneous records not assignable to any particular dynasties or kings. The whole collection has been reviewed in the Annual Reports on S.I. Epigraphy for 1907 and 1908. A brief notice of some of the inscriptions may be useful here as preliminary to a detailed study of the records.

**CHOLAS**

2\. Of the Chola kings there are more than 300 epigraphs ranging from the time of Parantaka I down to Rajendra-Chola III the last ruling king of the line. In most of his inscription which number about 40, **Parantaka** is given the attribute *Madiraikondd,* While No.328 dated in his 41 year adds I1am to this achievement. A certain Kundavaidevi, probably a relation of his queen Kokkil1anadigal figures as a donor in a record of his 19^(th) year (No.261) while another inscription of his 23^(rd) year (No.315) mentions Purvadevi-Adigal in that capacity. This princess is already known to us as the queen-mother of Sundara-Chola Parantaka II and hence the consort of prince Arinjaya (S. I. I., Vol. XIII, No.271). Inscription from Triuvidaimarudur dated in the 37^(th) and 38^(th) years of the king give the names of two local officers Irumadisola-Pallavaraiyar (No. 195) and Kurumbil Vasudevanar (Nos.222, 224 and 227), under whose supervision the Sabha of Tiraimur and the *Nagarattar* of Tiruvidaimarudil as will as the temple establishment, are said to have met in the *Natak*asalai of the temple for the purpose of receiving certain gifts made to the temple. One of these was an endowment of land for a dipamala in the temple by a merchant of Kumaramarttandapuram. This town so named after a title of Pallava Nandivarman III (S. I. I., Vol. III, No. 91), seems to have been a commercial centre situated, like Tiruvidaimarudur in Tiraimur-nadu. A gift of money for a lamp by another merchant of the same place is recorded in No.262 of the kingâ€™s 17^(th) year as having been left in charge of the Sankarappadiyar of the place. We may take this to have been the name of a corporate body of men closely associated with the *Nagarattar* community having their own residential quarters *(kudi)* in big townships (Ep. Ind., Vol. XXII, No.24).

3\. **Sundara-Chola** the grandson of parantaka has two epigraphs of which No.40 from Tiruvisalur has been published in S. I. I., Vol. III. The other which is a Fragment (No.139), is from Kodumbalur and makes mention of a certain Pudi Pattalakan Nakkan the brother of a lady attached to the royal household. He was possibly a relation of Parantakan Siriyavelar the brother-in-law and military officer of Sundara-Chola.

4\. Five inscription in the collection belong to **Aditya II Karikala,** the son and successor of Sundara-Chola. His Period of rule has been definitely fixed between A. D. 964 and 969 with the help of an inscription of his opponent Vira-Pandya from Ambasamudram (Ep. Ind., Vol. XXV, No. 6). Aditya is known in his epigraphs by the appellation â€œParakesarivaraman who took the head of the Pandya (or Virapandya)â€? In No 256 Dated in his 3+1^(st) year he is said to have Vanquished Virapandya and taken his head.â€™ This is an unfinished record stopping With the mention of a local officer by name Parantaka Muvendavelar, Who also figures in Nos. 249 and 255 of the same king in connection with some gifts to the temple.

5\. Inscriptions of Rajaraja I range Between his 5^(th) and 29^(th) tears of reign. Those of his earlier years begin merely with his name Rajarajakesarivaraman or with the addition of the short attribute *Salai kalam drutta*. This feat is found mentioned in inscriptions as early as the 4^(th) year of his reign (No.395 of 1922), and we first find the introduction *Tirumagal-pola* ect. In his 9^(th) tear inscription (No. 97 of 1921). No.19 of the present collection, from Tiruvisalur, gives details of date in the 5^(th) year of the king, which correspond to A.D. 989, December, 1. In this year, Battan Danatongiyar, a queen of his, is said to have made an endowmentof 100 Ilakkasu to the temple to feed 5 persons versed in the Vedas, Vedartha and Mantra. Another queen, Panchavan-Madeviyar, consecrated an image of the goddess in the temple for Karmmarchanai in the 10^(th) year of the king (No.279). The royal palace at Tanjavur Known as Kodandarman-velam or Kodanda â€“velam finds mention in two records one from Tiruvisalur (No.279) and the other from Aduturai (No.356). Sembiyanmadev, mother of Uttama-chola, as donor in another inscription from Aduturai (No.362).

Rajaraja, it is well know, is famous for his great ability in Administration. The revenue survey and settlement carried out in his reign, which finds prominent mention in his Tanjavur inscriptions of his later years, is incidentally referred to in Nos.44 and 347 both dated in his 26^(th) year. A linear standard measure called the Ulagalandan-kol and reminiscent of this survey is mentioned in a 5^(th) year record of his son Rajendrachola from Kuttalam (No. 487 ). In No.44 just quoted above, which records a gift of land by queen Vanavan_Madevi, the village Vembarrur of which Tirivisalur formed a part, is called by its other name Avanianrayana â€“Chaturvedimangalam, while in a record dated three years later (No.42) and in all subsequent inscriptions it is known as Solamarttanda â€“chaturvedimangalam, the change in name thus made being evidently to commemorate a biruda of Rajaraja. In the historical introduction of the latter epigraph we find, added to the usual list of his conquest, the mention of â€œTwelve thousand islands of the seaâ€? by which name the Maldives are said to have been known in ancient times. This naval victoryseems to be the last of Rajarajaâ€™s achievements which proved to be the fore-runner of still greater conquests, of his son in latter times. The inscription is interesting as registering a gift of 458 kasu to provide for some offerings to the deity at Tiruvisalur, by Rajarajaâ€™s queen Dantisaktivitankiyar on the occasion of the Hiranya-garbha and the Tulabhara ceremonies performed in the temple by the royal couple.
