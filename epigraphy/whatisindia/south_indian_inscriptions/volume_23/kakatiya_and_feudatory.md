Provision was also made for the daily supply of three flower garlands to the temple through one Dasar Tirumangaiyalvan for a remuneration of the daily sustenance with a *nali* of offered rice and 2 *madai* in cash once every year.

The inscription is damaged. It is dated in Saka 1213, Khara, Kanya, ba. 8, Monday, Punarvasu corresponding to A.D. 1291, September 17. It records a gift of a land behind the temple and an areca-garden as *sarvamanya* to the temple of Lakshminarayana-Perumal at Gundalur in Merpakkai-nadu of Adhirajendramandalam, by the chief (Ambadeva) for his own welfare and prosperity. This Ambadeva belonged to a family of Kayasthas of whom the first member Gangaya-Sahini was a cavalier in the service o Kakatiya Ganapati. He was succeeded in his office by his sisterâ€™s son Janniga-Janardanadeva and next to him came Tripurarideva (No. 229 of 1936) whose younger brother and the most powerful of the family was Ambadeva. The troublous times that followed after the death of Ganapati and during the reign of Rudramba account for this chiefâ€™s not  
acknowledging any overlord. No. 268 of 1905 from Tripurantakam in Kurnool gives a long account of his exploits (A. R. for 1906, Part II, para 44).
