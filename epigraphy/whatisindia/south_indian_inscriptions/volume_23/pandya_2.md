**Maravarman Kulasekhara (unidentified )**

## **No. 101**

**(Page No 66)**

**(*A. R*. No. 101 of 1907)**

**Kallidaikkurichchi, Ambdasamudar Taluk, Tirunelveli District**

**Nagesvaram-Udaiyar temple â€“on the north wall of the Goddess shrine**

**Mar. Kulasekhara : year 20**

It is not clear whether this Kulasekhara could be identical with Kulasekhara whose accession took place in A.D. 1268, as his claim to the conquest â€˜of all countriesâ€™ is not found here. It registers a gift of some land by one adiggaimanar Kulasekhara of Nalayira Isvaramudaiyar and Nilaiyudaiya-Pandisvaramudaiyar (at Kallidaika-kurichchi) in Rajaraja-chaturvedimangalam. Among the boundaries to this gift garden are mentioned a *tirunadavanam* and a *tiruvidaiyattam* belonging to the temple of Nalayira-Vinnagar-Emberuman in the same village.

## **No. 125**

**(Page No 94)**

**(*A. R.* No. 125 of 1907)**

**Pappankulam, Ambasamudram Taluk, Tirunelveli District**

**Sidhajnanesvara temple --- on the west wall of the temple kitchen**

**Maravarman Kulasekhara : year 8**

This is dated in the 8^(th) regnal year of the king who is probably the one who ascended the throne in A.D. 1268. The details of the date given which should fall in A.D. 1276 are however irregular since it is not possible for Dhanus, ba. 2 to combine with Svati as mentioned in the record. The inscription registers the sale of a village (?) called Mangalakkulam with its income and appurtenances, by the *urar* (assembly ) of Karkurichchi *alias* Vikramapandya-nallur in Seranaivenran-tirumadaivilagam for 3230 *panam* exclusive of the land already sold by them to the temple in Aippasi month for the purpose of a flower-garden and for forming a street. Reference is made to a previous mortgage of the hands to one Vikrama-Pandya-Solakonar and their redemption now form the hands of his son Anjadaperuman. The *Karanmaikkani* (tenancy) of the lands is said to have been held by one Kalamegan Alagandar *alias* Nayanar Gangaiyar who was responsible for the collection of the *kadamai* (tax) from the temple treasury ( for payment to the State ?). Among the boundaries are mentioned lands belonging to the temples of Piravari-Vinnagar-Emberuman in the 10^(th) *Cheri* of Rajaraja-chaturvedimangalam, of Bhagavati-Vinnagar-Emberuman at Velarurichchi and of Rajendra-Vinnagar-Emberuman (in the same place?).

## **No. 127**

**(Page No 99 )**

**(*A. R.* No. 127 of 1907)**

**Pappankulam, Ambasamudram Taluk, Tirunelveli District**

**Sidhajnanesvara temple --- on the same wall**

**Mar. Kulasekhara**

This is also an inscription of the same king. The regnal year is lost but the details of date can be read as (Makara) ba. 14, Thursday, Anushanm. It registers another sale of land in their village by the same *Uravar* of Vikramapandya-nallur to the temple for 928 *Danapala-guligai-panam.* This also refers to a previous mortgage of the land made in the 8^(th) year of the king. With two individual by name Vanarayar and Sulapanippillai for 728 *panam* which seems to have been paid back now to the mortgages out of this sale amount.

**No. 128**

**(Page No 100)**

**(*A. R.* No. 128 of 1907)**

**Pappankulam, Ambasamudram Taluk, Tirunelveli District**

**Siddhajanesvara temple-on the south wall of the first** *prakara*

**Mar. Kulasekhara : year 8**

This belongs to the 8^(th) year of the same king, and seems to be connected with the sale transaction mentioned in No. 127 above, as it records the receipt (*nattu*) by the same assembly for the amount of mortgage paid by them to the two mortgagees out of the sale amount of 928 *panam.*

**No. 135**

**(Page No 108)**

**(*A. R*. No.135 of 1907)**
