**(*A. R.* No. 494 of 1907)**

**Kuttalam, Mayuram Taluk, Tanjavur District**

**Uttaravedisvara temple â€“ on the south wall of the same *mandapa***

This is dated Saka 1303, Durmati, Rishabha, ba. 6, Wednesday, Avittam (A.D.1381, May 15) and mentions Kampana-Udaiyar at about the end. This is much damaged and seems to record a remission of some taxes consequent on a draught and famine (?) in the country during the (previous) year Raudri.

This records the gift of a *dipamale* (lights) to a god (name not clear) by Bukkayave the ardhangalakshmi (queen) of Vira Harihararaya (Harihara II) for the merit of her spiritual teacher Bhaskaradevayya.

corresponds to Saka 1299,) Ani 14. It seems to record an instrument of assurance addressed to the *Tandirimar* of Kalvasal-nadu, Kananadu and other places declaring Malaiyalangudi to be a place of refuge for all of them. It corresponds to the Anjinanpugalidam â€œthe asylum for the fear-strickenâ€? of other inscription.

The dated portion is also imperfect, the words clearly readable being su. 8, Sravana, Friday. It seems to mentions the *nayakattana of same* chief (*mahamandalesvara)* who is said to be of the Atri-gotra and Apastamba-sutra and some gift for offering in the temple.
