**INSCRIPTIONS COLLECTED DURING THE YEAR 1906-07**

**PREFACE**

This volume in the South Indian Inscriptions Series deals with the epigraphs copied during the year 1906-07. Most of the records included in it are in Tamil, and a few are in Telugu and Kannnada. The entire volume has been edited by Shri G. V. Srinivasa Rao, B.A. who, in spite of his retirement as Senior Epigraphical Assistant in 1945, undertook to do this work for the Archaeological Survey.

Inscriptions copied between the years 1887 and 1903 were all published in the first eight volumes of the Series. The subsequent volumes, however, contain only some of the records copied 1904 and 1928 the selection of epigraphs being made on a linguistic and dynastic basis. The present volume contain the as yet unpublished inscriptions copied in 1906-07. All the 623 records have been arranged here serially; but while those published in the other volumes are only mentioned with references, full texts of the unpublished epigraphs have been quoted together with a summary of their contents in English.

It is hoped that this volume will be as welcome to scholars interested in the various aspects of South Indian History as the previous volumes of the Series have been.

Shri K. G. Krishnan, Superintending Epigraphist and Shri C. R. Srinivasan have rendered considerable assistance in going through the proof for which many thanks are due to them.
