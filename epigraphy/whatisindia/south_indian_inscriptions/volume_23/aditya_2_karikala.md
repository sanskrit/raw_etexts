**(Page No 30)**

**(A. R. No. 51 of. 1907)**

**Tiruvisalur, Kumbhakonam Taluk, Tanjavur District**

**Sivayoganatha temple--- on the same wall**

**Aditya II Karikala : year 5 : A.D. 969-70**

This is dated in the 5^(th) year of Parakesarivarman â€˜who took the head of the Pandya â€˜ i.e. of Vira-pandya. This is the Chola king Aditya II Karikala the elder brother of Rajaraj I, whose earliest inscription mentioning this exploit is dated in his 2^(nd) year (A.R. No. 472 of 1908), which should have corresponded with the 20^(th) and last year of reign of his adversary. As this has been fixed at A.D.966 Adityaâ€™s accession should have place in A.D. 965 (*Ep.ind. Vol*. XXV, p. 37). Leyden Grant and the Tiruvalangudu plates it is known that Aditya distinguished himself even as a boy in his father Sundara-cholaâ€™s battles against the Pandya. He must have been appointed co-regent by the latter even in his life-time, but was not destined to live long. The date given in the present inscription is the latest regnal year known for him so far.

The record registers a gift of 15 *kalaju* of gold made by one singan Kesavan of Nelveli in Punrir-kurram for burning a perceptual lamp in the temple of Tiruvisalur Prrumanadigal, with 4 *ulakku* of ghee per day accruing as interest on the amount endowed. A similar gift was also made by his wife (*mamagal)* Raman Perral for another lamp.

**Mahalingasvami temple â€“ on the same wall**

**Aditya II Karikala : date lost.**

This belongs to the reign of Parakesarivarman â€˜who took the head of the Pandyaâ€™, and records the gift of a quarter (veli) of land for the maintenance of a garden by one Tiruvenkattu-Pichchan named Parantaka Muvendevelar, who also figures in No. 260 of 1907 ascribed to the reign of Parantaka II Sundara â€“ Chola, where he is said to have endowed a flower garden to the temple.

**No. 255**

**(Page No 174)**

**(*A. R*. No. 255 of 1907)**

**Tiruvidaimarudur, Kumbhakonam Taluk, Tanjavur District**

**Mahalingasvami temple â€“ on the same wall**

**Aditya II Karikala : year 4+1 : 969 A.D.**

This is a damaged and incomplete inscription of Parakesarivarman â€˜who took the head of the Pandyaâ€™. This records some provision made by a resident of Uttarangudi with the Sabha of Tiraimur for the maintenance of a Pandari in the temple. A Pandari is a Saiva devotee dedicated for the service in the temple like preparing flower-garlands to the deities, singing devotional hymns etc.

**No. 256**

**(*A. R* . No. 256 of 1907)**

**Tiruvidaimarudur, Kumbhakonam Taluk, Tanjavur District**

**Mahalingasvami temple â€“ on the same wall**

**Aditya II Karikala : year 3+1 : 968 A.D.**

This, like the inscription above, is also of the same king who is said to have â€œdefeated Vira-Pandya and taken off his headâ€?. The inscription stops with the mention of Parantaka-Muvendavelar who was the Supervisor of the temple at the time.
