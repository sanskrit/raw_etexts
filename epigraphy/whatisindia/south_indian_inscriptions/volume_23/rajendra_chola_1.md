**(Page No 24)**

**(A. R. No. 46 of. 1907)**

**Tiruvisalur, Kumbhakonam Taluk, Tanjavur District**

**Sivayoganatha temple--- on the same wall**

**Rajendra-Chola I : year 3 : 1014-15 A.D.**

This is a damaged and incomplete record. It registers the gift of a gold necklace containing the tali (auspicious ornament) set with precious stones and others parts (for the image of the goddess), to the temple of god Tiruvisalur-Mahadeva, by Atiyiraman Kundappavaiyar the queen of pandya Srivalluvar (Srivallabha) and daughter of a chief of Pangala-nadu (name not given). Mention is also made of a certain Sundarasolan (as donor) along with the queen. The gift by a pandya queen to a temple in the chola territory at this period is noteworthy, as indicating friendly relations between the two kings. Srivallabha must have been occupying quite a subordinate position under the Chola since the latterâ€™s father Rajaraja I is known (from the Tiruvalangadu Plates)to have seized the pandya king Amarabhujanga, and Rajendra himself set up his son under the title Chola-Pandya as his viceroy in the Pandya country.
