**PANDYA INSCRIPTIONS**

**INSCRIPTION OF THE EARLY PANDYAS**

**Nos. 1 and 2.**

**(A. R. Nos. 453 and 454 of 1906)**

**Anaimalai, Madurai Taluk, Madurai District.**

**On the walls of the verandah in the rock-cut cave-temple of**

Narasimha-Perumal on the hill.

These two records engraved in early Grantha and Vatteluttu characters belong to Maranjadalyan who is also called Parantaka. They are important because the Kali year 3871 is also quoted for this king, thus furnishing a valuable chronological landmark for early Pandya history. The rock-cut temple of Narasimha was begun by Maran-Kari *alias* Muvendamangalapperaraiyan, a *vaidya* of Karavandapura *alias* Kalakkudi and an *Uttaramantrin* (minister) of the Pandya king, but as he died subsequently, the work was completed by his brother Maran-Eyinan *alias* Pandimangala-Visaiyaraiyan who succeeded him in the office of minister, who added the *mukha-mandapa* and had the consecration ceremony performed. As the person first mentioned had also the title Madurakavi, it has been tentatively assumed that he had some connection with the Vaishnava Alvar named Kari Maran *alias* Nammavar, the author of the *Tiruvaymoli*. Karavandapuram has been identified with Ukkirankottai in the Tirunelveli taluk of the district of the same name, in the inscriptions copied from which, the village is called Kalakkudi and Ka andai.

**No. 3**

**(A. R. No. 373 and 454 of 1908)**

**Tirupparankunram, Madurai Taluk, Madurai District.**

**On one of the pillars in the rock-cut cave.**

This Vatteuttu inscription dated in the 6th year of Maranjadaiyan which is engraved in arachaic letters, has been attributed to Jatila Parantaka of the Anaimalai inscription noted above. It records the construction of the Tirukkoyil (shrine) and of the Sir-tatakam (tank) by Sattan-Ganapati, a resident of Karavandapura,[](#_ftn3) who is called Pandi-Amritamangalavaraiyan, and is stated to have belonged to the Vaidya caste and to have been the mahasamanta of the king. The shrines of Durgadevi and Jyeshthadevi were constructed by Nakkan-Korri, who is described as the Dharmapatn probably of this mahasamanta. On account of the interest of this record, the text is reproduced here.

**No. 4**

**(A. R. No. 480 and 454 of 1917)**

**Kuttalam, Tenkasi Taluk, Tirunelveli District.**

**On a pillar in the north-side of the Kurralanatha temple.**

This incomplete record is dated in the 4th year and 360th day of the Pandya king Maranjadaiyan and mentions the gift of some donation by Maran-Achchan, probably a petty chieftain of Poliyur, for a lamp in the temple of Tirukurralattu-Bharata. This person also figures in a record from Tiruppattur in the Ramanathapuram district, where he is mentioned with the other title of Tennavan Pallavaraiyan.

**No. 5**

**(A. R. No. 90 and 454 of 1908)**

**Tiruppattiru, Tiruppattur Taluk, Ramanathapuram District**

**On the north wall of the Thiruttalisvara temple.**

This bilingual inscription consists of a portion in Sanskrit and a portion in Tamil. The Sanskrit portion states that Tennavan-Pallavadhipa alias Maran-Aditya born at Polivur in Poliyur-nadu made a gift of 40 Krishna-kacha for burning a lamp in the temple of Sulapani at Sristhali. The Tamil portion, dated the in the 4th + 1st year and 593rd day of the reign of Maranjadaiyan states that Maran-Achchan of Poliyur in Poliyur-nadu gave a donation of 40 kalanju to the Sabha of Manarkudi for a lamp to be burnt in the temple of Tirukkarrali-Bhatara at Tirupputtur, a brahmadeya in Mikundaru in Koluvur-kurram and another gift of kalanju to the vannar of the place. This chieftain Maran-Achchan has figured in another record from Kuttalam in the Tirunelveli District.

**No. 6**

**(A. R. No. 364 of 1907)**

**Aduturai, Papanasam Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On the north wall of the Apatsahayesvara temple**

This inscription of Maranjadaiyan of the year opposite to the year which was itself opposite to the fourth year of the king comes from Aduturai. From a record of the Chola king Uttama-Chola it is learnt that this temple was rebuilt during his reign by his pious mother Sembiyan-Mahadeviyar, and so the characters in which this record is engraved are later that the time of Varaguna to whom this and the next record can be attributed. This epigraph registers some provision made for the supply of one uri of oil daily to the temple of Mahadeva at Tirukkurangadutura  
in Tiraimur-nadu. Kurangaduturai has been curtailed into the modern name of Aduturai.
