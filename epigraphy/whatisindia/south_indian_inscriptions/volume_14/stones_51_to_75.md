**PANDYA INSCRIPTIONS**

**INSCRIPTION OF THE EARLY PANDYAS**

**No. 51.**

**(A. R. No. 604 of 1926.)**

**Tenur, Madurai Taluk, Madurai District.**

**On a pillar lying in a ruined site.**

This record of the **2 + 6^(th) year** of the reign of **Sadaiya-Maran** registers a gift of 50 sheep by Velan-araiyan of the village for burning a lamp to god Tirumerrali-Bhatara at Peruntenur in Paganur-kurram. The pillar must have belonged to the temple, ruins of which are found in the site. Though Tirumerrali may signify a temple of Vishnu, for Vishnu temples are generally located in the west of the village and are called as such, a neglected *linga* found in the locality indicates that the original temple may have belonged to god Siva. In some places Siva temples have also been called â€˜Tirumerrali.â€™

**No. 52.**

**(A. R. No. 447 of 1907.)**

**Sinnamanur, Periyakulam Taluk, Madurai District.**

**On the north wall of the Lakshminarayana temple.**

This inscription is dated in the 2 + 7th of Sadaiy-Marana who is identical with Rajasimha, and registers a gift of sheep by a certain Nagan-Vikkiramadittan for a perpetual lamp to the god Tiru. . . . . surattevar of Arikesarinallur, a brahmadeya in Ala-nadu. As Sinnamanur was known as Arikesarinallur, it may have been founded by the early Pandya king called Arikesarin. In another record of this king from the same place, the god is called Tirunaduvu-Bhatara, probably because of the location of the temple with reference to the village.[](#_ftn1)

**No. 53.**

**(A. R. No. 416 of 1917.)**

**Kuttalam, Tenkasi Taluk, Tirunelveli District.**

**On a pillar in the east verandah of the Kuttalanatha temple.**

This vatteluttu record dated in the 2 + 7th year of the reign of Sadaiya-Maran is incomplete and stops with the mention of Tirukkurralam in Tenvara-nadu.

**No. 54.**

**(A. R. No. 441 of 1907.)**

**Sinnamanur, Periyakulam Taluk, Madurai District.**

**On the west wall of the Lakshminarayana temple.**

The stone on which this inscription of the 2 + 8th year of the reign of Sadaiya-Maran had been originally engraved, has been redressed, and the record has suffered damage. It registers a gift of 10 kalanju by a brahmana named Nakkan Duvedi (Dvivedi) of Avichchanur, a brahmadeya of Anmaga-Nadu (the Anma-nadu of other records), for a perpetual lamp to be burnt in the temple of god Tirunaduvupattara at Arikesarinallur, a brahmadeya in Ala-nadu. Arkesarinallur was the ancient name of Sinnamnur, and Tirunaduvu-Bhatara, the god of the â€˜centralâ€™ temple has, as noted above, reference to the location of the temple in the center of the village.[](#_ftn2)

**No. 55.**

**(A. R. No. 605 of 1926.)**

**Tenur, Madurai Taluk, Madurai district.**

**On a pillar lying in a ruined site.**

This inscription of the 2 + 8th year of Sadaiya-Maran records a gift of sheep by a certain Araiyan-Tiruvarangi for a lamp in the temple of Tirumerrali-Bhatara of Peruntenur in Paganur-kurram.

**No. 56.**

**(A.R. No. 86 of 1907.)**

**Ambasamudram, Ambasamudram taluk, Tirunelveli District.**

**On the base of a ruined shrine in the Tirumulanatha temple.**

The subjoined record of the 2 + 9th year of king Sadaiya-Maran relates to the purchase of a block of waste land lying fallow as purru and Terri to the west of the village, from the sabha of Ilangoykkudi, and to its being made fit for cultivation by the provision of irrigation facilities by Puvan-Paraiyan, who is described as one of the â€˜Araiyan-anukkarâ€™, belonging apparently to the kingâ€™s bodyguard. The land which was renamed as â€˜Paraiyan-vasakkalâ€™ was endowed the temple as kidaippuram.
