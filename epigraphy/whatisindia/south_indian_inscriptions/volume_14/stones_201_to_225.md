**PANDYA INSCRIPTIONS**

**MEDIAEVAL PANDYAS**

**(JATAVARMAN SRIVALLABHA.)**

**No. 201.**

**(A. R. No. 19 of 1929.)**

**Sivapuri, Tiruppattur Taluk, Ramanathapuram District.**

**On the north wall of the *prakara* in the Svayamprakasesvara temple.**

This epigraph dated in the **3^(rd) year** of the king who is simply called **Srivallabha** without any distinguishing epithet, has, on paleographical grounds, to be attributed to the Jatavarman of that name. It registers a gift of one *ma* of land made by a certain Tiruchchirrambalamudaiyan Niraitavanjeydal for a lamp to be burnt in the temple of Tiruttandoariyandar.

**No. 202.**

**(A. R. No. 394 of 1929-30.)**

**Attur, Tiruchchendur Taluk, Tirunelveli District.**

**On the north wall of the central shrine in the Somanatha temple.**

This record dated in the 3rd year of Srivaladeva, i.e, Srivallabhadeva, has to be attributed to Jatavarman Srivallabha. It registers a gift of money by Puvandi, the wife of Appippuvan, a vellala Anguttanallur in Kalattirukkai-nadu for a lamp in the temple of Somanathadeva at Arrur.

**No. 203.**

**(A. R. No. 345 of 1930-31.)**

**Veppilaippatti, Sattur Taluk, Ramanathapuram District.**

**Round a pillar in the Gangaiamman temple.**

This inscription is dated in the 3rd year of Srivallabhadeva and states that this pillar was put to mark the site of the bund (anaikuri) of the tank (uruni) of Irunjonadu by Araiyan Madhurantakan alias Karunilakkudi-nadalvan.

**No. 204.**

**(A. R. No. 27 of 1909.)**

**Kunnakkudi, Tiruppattur Taluk, Ramanathapuram District.**

**On a pillar on the rock-cut cave on the hill.**

This record dated in the 4th year of Jatavarman Srivallabhadeva is much damaged at the end. Its contents cannot, therefore, be correctly

ascertained. It appears to register a gift made by Vellanai-Vitankan Avaiyanjan, the chief of Adalaiyur in Keralasinga-valanadu, of certain taxes due from Merkannamangalam in favour of the temple of Srimulasthanam-udiya-Nayanar on the hill called Tirumalai in Adaliyur-nadu.

**No. 205.**

**(A. R. No. 493 of 1909.)**

**Solapuram, Kovilpatti Taluk, Tirunelveli District.**

**On the east wall of the mandapa in the venkatachalapati-Perumal temple.**

This record of Jatavarman Srivallabha which is dated in the 4th regnal year is of interest as mentioning a pillaiyar or prince named Sundara-Pandyadeva, who laws camping at Arukai Kunrattur in Anma-nadu at the time of issuing this inscription. It is stated that on the representation made by the sabha of Sundarapandya-chaturvedimangalam, a devadana-brahmadeya village of god Sundarapandya-vinnagar-Alvar in the same nadu the prince made a gift of land to the temple.

This Sundara-Pandya who is described as a â€˜Pillaiyarâ€™ was apparently the son of Srivallabha, but he does not appear to have succeeded to the Pandya throne.

**No. 206.**

**(A. R. No. 6 of 1929.)**

**Dalapatisamudram, Nanguneri Taluk, Tirunelveli District.**

**On the south wall of the shrine in the Tirunagesvara temple.**

This inscription dated in the 4th year of the king is engraved in slightly later script. The lateness of the script may be accounted for by supposing that the earlier records were re-copied later at the time of some renovation. The king is stated to have been seated on the pallikkattil called Pandyarajan in the Alagiya-Pandyan hall in the palace at Madurai when, on the petition of a certain Ayyar of Anabharanamangalam, he made tax-free some lands belonging to the temples of Varaguna-Isvaramadaiyar, Tirunagesvaramudaiyar and Puravuvarisvaramudaiyar and Puravuvarisvaramudiayar, at Perumbalanji Nattarruppokku.
