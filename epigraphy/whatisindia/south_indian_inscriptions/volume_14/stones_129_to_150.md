**PANDYA INSCRIPTIONS**

**INSCRIPTION OF THE EARLY PANDYAS**

**No. 129-130.**

**(A. R. Nos. 603 to 604 of 1915.)**

**Eruvadi, Nanguneri Taluk, Tirunelveli District.**

**On a boulder in the Irattaipottai rock.**

The following two labels engraved in Vatteluttu characters of the early 9^(th) century A.D. are found below the images of Jaina Gods sculptured on the face of the rock overhanging a cavorn on the hill. One of them states that the ascetic Ajjanand was responsible for the setting up of the image under which the inscription is engraved, while the other mentions a *sabha*. This Ajjanandi has figured in similar donative labels at Uttamapalaiyam and Ayyampalaiyam, two other Jains colonies in the Madurai district, which were flourishing in this period.

# **CHOLA-PANDYA VICEROYS**

**No. 131.**

**(A. R. No. 213 of 1932-33.)**

**Perungulam, Srivaikuntam Taluk, Tirunelveli District.**

**On the north side of the artha-mandapa in the Tiruvaludisvara temple.**

In the third year of Jatavarman Sundara-Chola-Pandya in which this inscription is dated, a certain Vellala of Perungulam alias Uttamasolanallur in Tiruvaludi-Valanadu made a gift of sheep for burning a lamp in front of the goddess Durgaiyar in the temple of Tiruvaludisvaram.

**No. 132.**

**(A. R. No. 107 of 1905.)**

**Mannarkoyil, Ambasamudram Taluk, Tirunelveli District.**

**On the north wall of the Gopalasvamin temple.**

This record dated in the 4th year o the reign of Jatavarman Sundara-Chola-Pandya states that the assembly having met in a hall of the ambalam, made some decision about the lands and houses granted to the gardeners, drummers, potters, garland-makers, torch-bearers and

devaradiyar of the temple of Sri-Rajendrasola-vinnagar-Alvar at Rajaraja-chaturvedimangalam, a brahmadeya in mulli-nadu, a subdivision of Mudigondasola-valanadu, a district of Rajaraja-Pandinadu. The record is incomplete and so the full details of the transaction are not available.

As stated in another inscription, from the same temple, the temple of Rajendrasola-vinnagar-Alavar was erected by the Chera king Rajasimha in the name of Rajendrasoladevar, the Chola king who was apparently his overload.

**No. 133.**

**(A. R. No. 108 of 1905.)**

**Mannarkoyil, Ambasamudram Taluk, Tirunelveli District.**

**On the north wall of the Gopalasvamin temple.**

This fragmentary inscription mentions the 6th year of the reign of a king those name, which is lost in the missing portion, may be Sundara-Chola-Pandya. It is noteworthy that a seat in the kudam or hall of the palace was called Rajendrasola-iranai-vilupparaiyan, evidently after the name of the officer, â€˜Tirumandira-olai-iyakamâ€™ of the same name, who also figures in this record ; and that the king was stated on this seat while issuing the order, which in its entirety may have some reference in the gift of the taxes on the lands in a village called Manabharana-chaturvedimangalam, which had been endowed as a devadana to the temple of Rajendrasola-vinnagar-Devar. The revenue officers mentioned here figure in other records of this viceroy.

**No. 134.**

**(A. R. No. 70 of 1907.)**

**Ambasamudram, Ambasamudram Taluk, Tirunelveli District.**

**On the south wall of the Tirumulanatha temple.**

This incomplete epigraph dated in the 6th year of Jatavarman Sundara-Chola-Pandya relates to some gift, the nature of which is not specified, made by Sendan-Tambi-Nangai, for burning a lamp in front of the Tirumulasthanattu-Mahadeva at Tiruchchalaitturai in Rajaraja-chaturvedimangalam, a brahmadeya in Mulli-nadu, a subdivision of Mudikondasola-valanadu, a division of Rajaraja-Pandinadu. Sendan seugaiyan, a merchant of Kshatriyasikhamanipuram  
is stated to be he guardian.
