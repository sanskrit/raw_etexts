**PANDYA INSCRIPTIONS**

INTRODUCTION

Very few inscriptions of the early Pandya kings mention the kingâ€™s name, along with the cognomen Maranjadaiyan or Sadaiyamaran, as the case may be, the fewer still give astronomical details that help us in fixing the exact reign periods of these kings. The most important among the records is the Anaimalai Sanskrit inscription[](#_ftn1) citing the Kali year 3871 (Karttika, Sunday) equivalent to 770 A.D., and affording a date for Parantaka-Sadaiyan, in whose reign the inscription is dated. The Velvikkudi plates issued by the same king are dated in his 3^(rd) regnal year and the Madras Museum plates, also issued by him, bear a date in the 17^(th) year of his reign. There is, however, no means of fixing the exact duration of the kingâ€™s reign.

The next important chronological landmark is the Saka year 792 coupled with the 8the regnal year of Varaguna, provided by an inscription from Ayyampalaiyam (No. 22), thus yielding the initial year 862-63 A.D. for this king. This date can only be ascribed to Varaguna II.

An inscription from Tiruvellarai (No. 12) dated in the 4^(th) + 9^(th) year of Maranjadaiyan gives the following details. Vrischika, Monday, Asvati, which have been calculated to yield the equivalent 824 A.D., November 7, and the king has been identified with Varaguna I. It has been pointed out that the details of the date also afford another equivalent, viz., 874 A.D., November 22, and therefore the king may as well be identified with Varaguna II who ascended the throne in c. 862 A.D. An inscription from Lalgudi (No. 12-B) and another from Javantinathapuram also yield dates which can similarly be equated with dates falling in the reign either of Varaguna I or of Varaguna II. Another inscription (No. 12-A) from Lalgudi probably of Maranjadaiyan *alias* Varaguna-maharaja records the gift of money made by the Pallava king *Tellarrerindu venra* Nandippottaraiyar to Mahadeva of Tiruttavatturai in Idaiyarru-nadu. This Pallava king has been identified with Nandivarman III (c. 851-73 A.D.). Considering the contemporaneity of Maranjadaiyan *alias* Varaguna II with *Tellarrerinda* Nandivarman III, all these records may be attributed to Varaguna II.

Most of the prominent generals and ministers of the early Pandyas hailed from the Vaidya family of Karavandapuram. Maran-Kari *alias* Muvendamangalapperaraiyan was the *uttaramantrin* (minister) of the Pandya king Maranjadaiyan Parantaka. There is no doubt that this Maran-Kari was the same as the *vaidya-sikhamani* Maran-kari, mentioned as the *anatti (ajnapti)* of the Velvikkudi plates. The Anaimalai Tamil inscription (No. 2) refers to the death of this Maran-Kari and to his younger brother Maran Eyinan *alias* Pandimangalavisaiyaraiyan succeeding him as a minister.

It is stated in the Velvikkudi plates that Marangari participated in the battle at Venbai with an army under his leadership when the Purvarajar attacked the Vallabha after the marriage of the Ganga princess with the Kongar-kon. Vallabha has been identified with the Chalukya king Kirtivarman II and the Kongar-kon with the Pandya king. Marangari is further described both in the Anaimalai record (No. 1) and in the same copper-plate charter as a sweet (*madhuratara*) orator and a poet and also as well-versed in the sciences.

Mahasamanta Murti-Eyinan, another important member of the Vaidya family and a junior contemporary of Maran-Kari, is mentioned as the *anatti (ajnapti)* in the Madras Museum plates dated in the 17^(th) year of Jatilavarman Parantaka Nedunjadaiyan. He was also known as Viramangalapperaraiyan and enjoyed the epithet *Dhiratara.*

Sattan Ganapati another *Mahasamanta* probably of the same king, was also a member of the Vaidya family Karavandapuram. This general, who was also known as Pandi Amritamangalavaraiyan, excavated the temple (*tirukkoyil*) and the tank at Tirupparankunram and his wife Nakkan Korri built two shrines for Durgadevi and Jyeshtha at the same place (No. 3).

An inscription from Tirupparankunram, engraved on the lintel of the doorway of the Durga shrine, refers to the excavation of a temple from the rock for Sambhu and to the consecration of an image of ghe god by Ganapati *alias Samanta* Bhima who is stated to be a prominent member of the Vaidya family (*vai*\[*j*\]*ya-mukhya*), in the Kali year 3874 (773 A.D.). If the Siva temple under reference and the *irukkoyi* stated to have been excavated by Sattan Ganapati are identical as they appear to be, the date of the latter event, viz., the 6^(th) year of Maranjadaiyan, must be equated with 773 A.D., the date of the former event. Thus we get c. 768 A.D. as the date of accession for the Maranjadaiyan of this record (No. 3) who is no doubt identical with Parantaka Nedunjadaiyan.

Kravandapurana, the native place of the members of the Vaidya family, was also known as Kalandai and Kalakkudi and was included in the division called Kalakkudi-nadu. This place has been identified with Ukkirankottai in the Tirunelveli Taluk, Tirunelveli District. Nedunjadaiyan, who issued the Madras Museum plates, was the founder of this *kottai* or fort. The name Ukkirankottai is nowhere mentioned in inscriptions so far copied in the region. But it is well known that Parantakan Viranaraya-sadaiyan (c. 900 A.D.) fought a battle at Kharangiri and captured a certain Ugra. Kharagiri and Ugra may perhaps be connected with Karavandapuram and Ukkirankottai respectively, as suggested by the late Mr. A.S. Ramanatha Iyer.

The mention of a servant of Virapandya in an inscription dated in the 2^(nd) + 18^(th) year of Sadaiya-maran (No. 68) who has been identified with Rajasimha enables us to regard Virapandya, identified with Solan-ralaikonda Virapandya, as the immediate successor of Rajasimha though the exact relationship between the two is not clear. The suggestion is strengthened by two Vatteluttu inscriptions from Salaigramam, which belong to the 2^(nd) + 1^(st) year of Sadaiya-maran of the former record has been identified with Rajasimha on account of the method of dating, e.g., year 2 + 14, year  
2 + 17, etc., and also on paleographical considerations. The paleographical resemblance between the two records is remarkable.
