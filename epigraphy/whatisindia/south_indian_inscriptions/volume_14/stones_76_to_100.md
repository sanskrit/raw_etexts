**PANDYA INSCRIPTIONS**

**INSCRIPTION OF THE EARLY PANDYAS**

**No. 76.**

**(A. R. No. 270 of 1928.)**

**Kottai-Karungulam, Nanguneri Taluk, Tirunelveli District.**

**On the north wall of the Rajasimhesvara temple.**

This damaged inscription in Vatteluttu characters belongs to the time of **Sadaiya-Maran** and is dated in some year opposite to the 2^(nd) year of his reign. It refers to the stone temple of **Rajasingechchuvaram** at Karungulam and to the gift of something for a perpetual lamp to be burnt in it. The temple must have been built by Rajasimha, after whom the god appears to have been so named.

**No. 77.**

**(A. R. No. 301 of 1916.)**

**Ambasamudram, Ambasamudram Taluk, Tirunelveli District.**

**On the south wall of the Erichchavudaiyar temple.**

This incomplete inscription of Sadaiya-Maran, the date of which is lost, refers to a certain Manabharanan-Podiyil-Velan whose wife may have provided perhaps for the burning of a lamp in the temple of Tirupottudaiya-Bhatara at Ilangoykkudi. From the mention of Manabharana as the surname of the person, it may be inferred that it was probably a biruda of the king Sadaiya-Maran himself. It does not occur, however, in his copper plate grant from Sinnamanur.

**No. 78.**

**(A. R. No. 440 of 1907.)**

**Sinnamanur, Periyakulam Taluk, Madurai District.**

**On the west wall of the Lakshminarayana-Perumal temple.**

This Tamil inscription is dated in the 46th year of a Sadaiya-Maran, whose identity with the other king of the same name is not clear, in the absence of similar records bearing such high regnal years. It differs from the usual run of inscriptions of this period in its registering an order (kaichcham) of the sabha of Arikesarinallur, a brahmadeya in Ala-nadu, regulating the supply of water from the channel called Srikantha-vaykkal, apparently to temple lands.

**No. 79.**

**(A. R. No. 420 of 1914.)**

**Pallimadam, Aruppukkottai Taluk, Ramanathapuram District.**

**On the south base of the Kalanthasvamin temple.**

This record is dated in the 3rd year opposite to the 4th year of the reign of Vira-Pandya who took the head of the Cholaâ€™ and registers a gift of sheep by Solantaka Pallavaraiayn alias Maran-Adichchan of Poliyur in Poliyur-nadu for burning a lamp in the temple of god Sundara-pandya-Isvarattu-Bhatara at Tiruchchuliyal a devadana in Paruttikkudi-nadu. Sundara-Pandya Isvaram must have been named after a king or prince of that name. The village is called Pallimadai or probably Pallipadai, in which latter case, the shrine may have been built in memory of a Sundara-Pandya.

A certain chieftain of Poliyur called Maran-Achchan alias Tennavan-Pallavaraipan figures in a record dated 4 + 1st year, 593rd day of a Maranjadaiyan from Tirupputtur, and he was probably an earlier member of the family to which the Maran-Achchan of this inscription belonged. Here he bears the title of Cholantaka-Pallavaraiyan from the biruda of the king Vira-Pandya namely Cholantaka, i.e., â€˜god of death to the Cholaâ€™ which is equivalent to â€˜Solanralaikondaâ€™ which is found in all his records. From this fact it is clear that a Chola king had actually been kill by Vira-Pandya. From a record of this king from Ambasamudram it has been possible to fix his initial date as A.D. 946.

**No. 80.**

**(A. R. No. 421 of 1914.)**

**Pallimadam, Aruppukkottai Taluk, Ramanathapuram District.**

**On the south base of the Kalanathasvamin temple.**

This inscription is dated in the 4th year opposite to the 4th year of the same kingâ€™s reign. It registers a gift of sheep by Arulali, the headman of a village in Venbu-nadu, for burning a lamp in the temple of god Sundara-Pandya-Isvarattu-Devar at Tiruchchuliyal, for the merit of his son Kandan-Devan.

**No. 81.**

**(A. R. No. 87 of 1907.)**

**Ambasamudram, Ambasamudram Taluk Tirunelveli District.**

**On the base of a ruined shrine in the tirumulanatha temple.**
