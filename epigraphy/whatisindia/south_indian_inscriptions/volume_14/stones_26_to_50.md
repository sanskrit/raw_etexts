**PANDYA INSCRIPTIONS**

**INSCRIPTION OF THE EARLY PANDYAS**

**No. 26.**

**(A. R. No. 690 of 1905.)**

**Ramanathapuram, Dindigal Taluk, Madurai District.**

**On a rock in the village.**

This Tamil inscription, which does not quote the regnal year of the king, states that Nakkan-pullan who had the other name of Parantaka-ppallivelan had accompanied king Maranjadaiyan in his campaign (yattirai) against Idavai in Sola-nadu. This Pullan had begun the excavation of an irrigation tank in his name, called it Pullaneri, strengthened the banks with stone revetment and fixed the sluice therefore; but he died before the project could be completed. The work is then stated to have been completed by Pulan-Nakkan, evidently his son, with the help of the mason named Vadugan-kurran and his son; and to the two latter a gift of land in the two *kurus* of Palli-nadu was made.

**No. 27.**

**(A. R. No. 89 of 1907.)**

**Ambasamudram, Ambasamudram Taluk, Tirunelveli District.**

**On a slab set up in front of the Tirumulanatha temple.**

This damaged Vatteluttu record of Maranjadaiyan is defaced at the placed where the regnal year is cited; but it appears probable that only one year and not a double year has been mentioned. The record may perhaps belong to Varagunavarman. It registers a gift of money made by Kavadiyar of Ilavenbaikkadattirukkai for two lamps to be burnt in the temple before the images of god Tiruchchalaitturai-Tirumulatanattur-Bhatarar and Perumanadigal â€˜who was pleased to stand at Tiruchchalaituraiâ€™ in Ilangoykkudi in Mulli-nadu.

**No. 28.**

**(A. R. No. 160 of 1930-31.)**

**Tiruchchatturai, Tanjore Taluk, Tanjore District.**

**On the west wall of the Odanavanesvara temple.**

This damaged inscription registers a gift of 300 kasu by Pandi-Marajar Vraguna-Marajar for burning a sacred lamp in the tempe of Tiruchchorrutturai-Mahadeva.

**No. 29.**

**(A. R. No. 215 of 1932-33.)**

**Perungulam, Srivaikuntam Taluk, Tirunelveli District.**

**On the south side of the Ardhamandapa in the Tiruvaludisvara temple.**

This damaged record, probably of \[Maranjadi\]yan, who is apparently the king mentioned in the first line, appears to register a gift of sheep by some one of Elur, whose name is lost, for a lamp in the temple.

**No. 30.**

**(A. R. No. 313 of 1904.)**

**Kudumiyamalai, Kulattur Taluk, (Pudukkottai State), Tiruchirappalli District.**

**On a pillar in the Melaikoyil temple.**

This record of Maranjadaiyan is dated in the 23rd year of his reign. Owing to the damaged condition of the letters, it is not possible to make out the contents of the record. Tirunilakkunram, the name of the hill and Tirumulattanam, that of the shrine, are traceable, and the record probably refers to a gift for a lamp to this temple.

**No. 31.**

**(A. R. No. 43 of 1908.)**

**Kalgumalai,[](#_ftn1) Melur Taluk, Madurai District.**

**On a slab in the Kosakkudi street.**

This record dated in the 23rd year of the reign of Maranjadaiyan from Kalugumalai is of interest as it mentions an expedition of the Pandya army against Sadaiyan-Karunandan of Malai-nadu, in which the fort of Ariviyur was destroyed. This Sadaiyan-Karunandan is identical with the Ay chieftain whose records are found in the northern part of the Travancore State. He may have originally been a Pandya vassal as indicated by the surname Sadaiyan and may have subsequently rebelled against the Pandya, in conjunction perhaps with the Venadu ruler of the period, which action was probably the case of the expedition referred to in this inscription. Two soldiers of the battalion commanded by the Pandya subordinate Etti-Mannan alias Mangala-Enadi of Perunechchuram, named Vinaiyantolu-Suran of Pundanamali in Tondai-nadu and Sattanakkan of Pereyirkudi lost their lives in this skirmish, and in commemoration of their services, some land valued at 20 kalanu of gold was given apparently by this Enadi. This endowment may have been in the nature of an udirappatti, but it is not clearly specified as such.
