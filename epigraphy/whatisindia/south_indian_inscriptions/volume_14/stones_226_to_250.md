**MEDIAEVAL PANDYAS**

**(JATAVARMAN SRIVALLABHA.)**

**(A. R. No. 21 of 1927.)**

**Vijayanarayanam, Nanguneri Taluk, Tirunelveli District.**

**On the south wall of the Rajagopalasvamin temple.**

This inscription dated in the **10^(th) year** of **Srivallabha** is incomplete and refers to some transactions made in the **31^(st) year** of **Kulottunga-Choladeva**, â€˜who took Kollamâ€™, relating to the temples of Varaguna-Vinnagar-Alvar, Sathagopa-vinnagar Alvar and Sri Raghavachakravartigal.

Vijayanarayana-chaturvedimangalam is stated to be a *brahmadeya* in Nattarruppokku and a certain Sankaran Vasudevan of Turuttimangalam is said to have been a person of note in the place (vide No. 231).

**No. 227.**

**(A. R. No. 18 of 1929.)**

**Sivapuri, Tiruppattur Taluk, Ramanathapuram District.**

**On the north wall of the second prakara in the Svayamprakasa temple.**

Dated in the 10th year of the king, this record of Sirvallabha without any distinguishing attributes, registers the gift of land in a plot called Tokkalivayal by a certain lady Panjan Uyyavandal of Aruviyur for a lamp to be burnt in the temple of Tiruttandonrisvaram-Udaiyar.

**No. 228.**

**(A. R. No. 111 of 1908.)**

**Tiruppattur, Tiruppattur Taluk, Ramanathapuram District.**

**On the north wall of the mandapa in the Tiruttalisvara temple.**

This epigraph dated in the tenth year and 205th day of the king registers remission of taxes amounting to 43 2/20 madai on two hamlets for providing worship to the god Tiruttali-Mahadeva at Tiruppattur a brahmadeya in Keralasinga-valanadu. At the request of Kalingarayan the king is stated to have issued this order while he was seated in the pallikkattil called Pandiyan in the hall Alagiyapandiyan in the inner precincts of the palace at Madurai.

An officer named Parakramapandiya-Uttaramantri figures in the record and so a Parakram-Pandya must have been a predecessor or at least a contemporary of this Srivallabhadeva.

**No. 229.**

**(A. R. No. 318 of 1908.)**

**Kuruvitturai, Nilakkottai Taluk, Madurai District.**

**On the north wall of the Chitrarathavallabha-Perumal temple.**

This order was issued when the king was seated in the sat Pandiyarajan in the Alagiyapandiayan hall in the palace at Solantaka-chaturvedimangalam in Paganurkurram and the 11th year quoted in the sixth line of the record was the year in which it was issued. Siddhakutti-Madhavan alias Solamuttaraiyan, the kilan of Mangadu in Mangadu-nadu, a subdivision of Puliyur-kottam, a division of Tondaimandalam had endowed some lands to the temple of Tiruchchakrattalvar in the village in the 2nd year, apparently of this king himself, but as a portion of them was not in the enjoyment of the temple as tax-free devadana the king rectified this defect on a representation made by his officer Kalingarajan. It is stated that the lands had been reconstituted into a new village called Kulasekharamangalam from the 2nd year itself from which it can be inferred that a Pandya king named Kulasekhara flourished at this time. A channel called parakramapandiyapperaru is also mentioned.

**No. 230.**

**(A. R. No. 423 of 1929-30.)**

**Attur, Tiruchchendur Taluk, Tirunelveli District.**

The same lady also made a gift of money for feeding itinerant pilgrims who came to the village (apurvigalay vanda). The lamp-stand is stated to have been cast with a figure of a woman holding a lamp.
