The following Vatteluttu and Tamil labels are engraved near the natural cavern in the hill called the Aivarmalai, which was called â€˜Ayiraimalaiâ€™ in the inscriptions. This Ayirai was famous in the olden times as a Jaina colony. The God Parsvanatha sculptured in this place was the recipient of some endowments in the reign of the Pandya king Varagunavarman in A.D. 870. The Vatteluttu labels engraved below the images of several Jaina Tirthankaras sculptured in half relief near this cavern are also attributable to the same period approximately, and they record the fact that the respective images were the gifts of **Ajjanandi, Indrasena, Mallisena, etc., Avvanandi-Kurattiyar** the disciple of Pattini-Kurattiyar also had an image sculptured on the rock. An ascetic by the name of Ajjanandi is mentioned in the *Jivakachintamani,* the premier Jaina classic of this early period.

No.115, which is written in a more archaic script, is very much damaged.

The subjoined Vatteluttu inscriptions are engraved in characters attributable to about the end of the 9th century and the beginning of the 10th century A.D. below the images of the Jaina deities sculptured in low relief on the face of the rock. Some of them are very much worn out while three of them are legible. They record that certain images were cut by Ajjanandi (No. 126) and by Arittanemi-Periyar, the disciple of Ashtopavasi Kanakavirar (No. 122). In No. 128 this hill is called Tirukkunagiri and a certain ascetic named Anantavara-Adigal is stated to have made a gift of money for a lamp to the God Tirukkunagiri-Devar.
