**PANDYA INSCRIPTIONS**

**MEDIAEVAL PANDYAS**

**(JATAVARMAN SRIVALLABHA.)**

**No. 251.**

**(A. R. No. 138 of 1910.)**

**Tenkarai, Periyakulam Taluk, Madurai District.**

**On a stone set up in the courtyard of the Mulasthanesvara temple.**

This record of **Jatavarman Srivallabha** is dated in the **20 + 1^(st) year** of his reign. It mentions the merchant-guild of Ayyapolil and appears to record certain rules framed by them in regard to the social classes *Valangai* and Idangai*. As* it is much damaged its full purport cannot be made out.

**No. 252.**

**(A. R. No. 93 of 1908.)**

**Tiruppattur, Tiruppattur Taluk, Ramanathapuram District.**

**On the east wall of the mandapa in the Tiruttalisvara temple.**

This inscription belongs to the 21st year of Tribhuvanachakravartin Srivallabhadeva, and registers a gift of 50 sheep by Rajendrasolan Keralan alias \[Nishadarajan for burning a lamp in the temple of Sritali-Paramesvara at Tirupputtur. Nishadarajan as evidently identical with Nishadarajan, who has figured in another record (A. R. No. 42 of 1929) of this king and in another of Kulottunga-chola I (A. R. No. 94 of 1908), after whose name he had apparently copied his surname Rajenderasolan.

**No. 253.**

**(A. R. No. 41 of 1929.)**

**Sivapuri, Tiruppattur Taluk, Ramanathapuram District.**

**On the south wall of the second prakara of the Svayamprakasa temple.**

This record of the 21st year of Tribhuvanachakravartin Srivallabha registers a gift of land by Tiruchchirramablam-udiayan Tiruvenkadattalvan of Marudur, a merchant of Aruviyur alias Desi-uyyavanda-pattanam for the kitchen expenses of the temple of Tiruttandonri-udaiyar at Nripasekhara-chaturvedimangalam. The land had been purchased from a certain Maran Koran.

**No. 254.**

**(A. R. No. 322 of 1908.)**

**Kuruvitturai, Nilakkottai Taluk, Madurai District.**

**On the north wall of the Chitraratha-vallabha-Perumal temple.**

This record of Jatavarman Srivallabha dated on the 200th day of the 22nd year of his reign purports to have been issued while the king was seated on the pallikkattil called Pandiyerayan in the theatre (natakasalai) with the palace at Madurai. It registers the remission of taxes granted by him in 5 veli of land, for worship, etc., to god Tiruchchakkarattalvar at Solanataka-chaturvedimangalam in Paganur-kurram.

The royal order issued under the name of Konerimaikondan is engraved in continuation of this document and both the records are signed by Parakramapandya-Uttaramantri.

**No. 255.**

**(A. R. No. 319 and 320 of 1908.)**

**Kuruvitturai, Nilakkottai Taluk, Madurai District.**

**On the north wall of the Chitrarathavallabha-Perumal temple.**

These two complementary inscriptions are dated in the 22nd year of an unspecified king who laws evidently Jatavarman Srivallabha. One of them is an order (olai) issued by Kalingarajan to the Srivaishnavas of the temple intimating the fact that the lands mentioned in No. 254 above belonging to the Chakrattalvar temple were made tax-free, and the second gives publicity to this exemption granted on these lands.

**No. 256.**

**(A. R. No. 709 of 1916.)**

**Sermadevi, Ambasamudram Taluk, Tirunelveli District.**

**On the south wall of the Ramasvamin temple.**

This is an incomplete inscription of the 22 + 1st year of the king and it stops after the mentioning the name of the village.

**No. 257.**

**(A. R. No. 555 of 1922.)**

**Tiruttangal, Sattur taluk, Ramanathapuram District.**
