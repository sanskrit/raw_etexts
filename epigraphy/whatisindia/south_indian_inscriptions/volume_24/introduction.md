**INTRODUCTION**

The Koyil, Periya-koyil or the Great temple of Ranganatha is situated in the island of Srirangam between the river Kaveri and its main branch Kollidam in the Thiruchirapalli District of the Tamil Nadu State.
Among the Vaishnava centers of pilgrimage it vies equally with the famous Tirupati of Venkatachala or Venkatesa, better known in the North as Balaji, and has been eulogized by almost all the Vaishnava saints or Alvars among whom some lived at this place and made it the scene of their devotional activities. Prominent among them were Kulasekhara the Chera king who renounced his kingdom only to devote his life to the service of this god and settled down at Srirangam with his daughter Cherakulavalli, and Tirumangaimannan or Alinadan, the chief who betook to banditry for the sole purpose of embellishing with the looted money.
The lord of Srirangam. He is said to have looted the golden image of Buddha at the *vihara* at Nagapattinam and with that gold renovated certain parts of the temples. The name of minor Alvars such as Tondaradippodi, Tirupanalvar who was born at Uraiyur near Srirangam, are also connected with this temple. Ramanujacharya, the great apostle of the Visishtadvaita Srivaishnavism spent as many as 60 years of his long life as the administrative head of this temple and effected many reforms in its internal management.

Kuruttalvar, Parasara-Bhatta, Vedanta-Desika and a number of other scholars also lived here. Manavala-Mahamuni or Alagiya-manavala, the Acharya of the Tenkalai â€“Vaishnava sect is said to have lived for a long time here giving religious discourses. The saint is reputed to have stayed at the Pallavarayan-matham in the South Uttira Street, where an image of his is being worshipped even now. The place is also associated with the famous Tamil poet Kambar whose *Ramayana*, according to tradition received its imprimatur here at the hands of the literary coteries of his time.

Architecturally the Ranganatha temple may be classed as the Uttamottama type as it has its full complement of seven *prakaras* running round the *garbhagriha* and has in addition, separate subsidiary shrines for all the minor *parivaradevatas* as prescribed in the *agamas*. The disposition of these shrines in the plan however shows variations from the places prescribed for them in accordance with the Vaikhanasa authorities. This is perhaps due to later renovations and alterations made knowingly or unknowingly in successive generations. In fact the temple had undergone so many alterations at the hands of pious kings of several dynasties and donors of different generations that it is difficult to distinguish between its nucleus and its later accretions.
The introduction of images of the Vaishnava-Alvars in shrines which previously contained images of gods appears also to have been a later innovation made during the time of Ramanuja and Vedanta-Desika. A shrine of Dhanvantiri , the god of medicine, which is located in the north side of the fourth *prakara*, is a unique feature not met with in any other temple in South India. A stucco figure of God Narasimha called Eduttakai-alagiyar depicted as tearing asunder the entrails of the demon king Hiranyakasipu, figures on the north *gopura* of the fourth *prakara* and provided with a *mandapa* constructed in front of it, presents a rare instance of an ornamental image of a *gopura* acquiring sanctity in course of time.

Sculpturally the temple does not present any outstanding features. The image of the main deity in the *garbhagriha* is a huge reclining stucco figure with undefined features; and the gold-plated representation of god Para-Vasudeva portrayed on the front side of the Vimana over the circular *garbhagribha*, is considered very sacred. The numerous *mandapas, prakara* walls and *gopura* that rose up at different periods do not exhibit any remarkable workmanship, except, in the case of the small temple of Krishna to the west of the main *mandapa* at the entrance leading into the fifth *prakara* with its outer walls embellished with ornamental niches containing beautiful sculptures which are typically fashioned after the Hoysala style, and the Sheshagiriyanmandapa on the east side of the fifth *prakara* which
contains a few well-made composite pillars of the type commonly met with in constructions of the Vijayanagara period namely, the rearing *yali* and hoses ridden over by hunting cavaliers piercing tigers with spears. The unfinished *gopura* at the south entrance in the outermost *prakara* which forms the portals as it were to this temple city has evoked the admiration of Fergusson by its massive proportions and if it had only been completed it would have risen up to a height of nearly 300 feet and would have been a remarkable feat of engineering unparalled in temple architecture.[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_24/introduction.html#_ftn1)


Ichnographically the temple offers a wide scope for study as it possesses an almost complete gallery of all the images required for worship according to Vaishnavagamas, some of them attributable to the 12^(th) and 13^(th) centuries. Unique among these which deserve special mention are a group of ten images called the Dasamurtis which are taken in procession round the temple on all important occasions, and Annamurti, the presiding deity of the temple kitchen. The latter, now somewhat mutilated and kept near the ghee-troughs in the *Ujnal-mandapam* is represented by a two-armed image holding a bolu of
(curd-rice) in one hand a kalasa (containing *Payasa*) in the other. In the *Prabha-mandapa* behind the head are carved the emblems of the *sankha* and *chakra*. The Padma-samhita (ch. XXVIII) describes the Annamurti image thus:-

Purnendu-bimba-madhyasthe sitapadme vivasvare!

asmam dhaval-akaram nilakunjitamurdhajam

dukula-kshauma-vasanam balyayogi vibhushanam!
