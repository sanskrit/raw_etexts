**Vijaya-Bhupati**

**No. 319**

(Page No. 327)

**(A. R. No. 53 of 1938-39 )**

**II Prakara, South Wall**

**( Sanskrit =1423 A.D.)**

Registers a gift of the village Kumarakkudi, in Malai-nadu, a sub-division of Rajaraja-valanadu, on the north bank in Tiruchchirappalli-usavadi, by the king Vijaya-Bhupati as a *dandikai-jivita* to **Uttama-Nambi,** a *sthanika* of the temple. The village is stated to have once been include in the *obali* for *piyadakai-jivita.* The terms *dandikai* and *piyadakai* mean palanquin and peon respectively. The date **Subhakrit, Magha, su. Padyami** corresponds to **A.D. 1423, January 13,** but cannot be verified. The record bears the signature of **Siruparasa** in Kannada characters.

**Devaraya II**

**No. 320**

(Page No. 327)

**(A. R. No. 161 of 1951-52)**

**III Prakara, Aryabhattal-vasal Tiers, Inner wall, Proper left of the Entrance**

**Saka 1349 (1427 A.D.)**

Fragmentary. Built in at places. Seems to refer to an endowment of land for a grove (*toppu)* after excluding from it the *manya* and *bhatta-vritt* portions. The donor whose name is lost appears to be a *sattada-Srivaishnava* hailing from Pratapagiri in Uttara-desa. The details of date are mutilated but for the years **Parabhava (expired) and Plavanga (current) and the** *nakshatra* Anuradha and are thus insufficient for verification. **But the cyclic year Plavanga--- (Saka 1349)** falling in the reign of **Devaraya (II 1422-1446 A.D.)** corresponds to **1427 A.D.**
