**III Prakara, inner wall.**

**No date**

The record, written in Sanskrit in Grantha characters, gives the genealogy of **Vitthala** of the **Aravidu** family and registers the grant of some villages for providing offerings, worship etc, to god Sriranganatha. **Nalla-Timma,** his elder brother made a *chandraprabhu-vahana* in silver, while **Ahobala-Dikshita** of **Krishnapuram,** probably their *guru*, presented a golden *suryaprabha* to the god for the godâ€™s procession during festivals.
The inscription is not dated. See Nos. 453-54 above.
