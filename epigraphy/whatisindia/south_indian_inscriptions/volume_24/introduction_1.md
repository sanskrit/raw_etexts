**INTRODUCTION**



Inscriptions (Nos. 151-65) of Rajaraja III reflect clearly the presence of the Hoysala generals and members of the Hoysala royal family who made liberal gifts of money and land. It is well-known that the Hoysalas played a prominent role in maintaining the balance of power between the declining Cholas under Rajaraja III and Rajendra III and the rising Pandyas under Maravarman Sudarapandya I. One (No. 152) of these inscriptions dated in the 9^(th) year (1224 A.D.) in the reign of Rajaraja III records a gift of land by purchase by Araiyan Viradamudittan *alias* Kurukularyar from the Pandya country. The same person designated as Pallavaraiyan figures as a high official attesting transactions I and those of Maravarman Sundarapandya II.

This volume contains some interesting information about the administration of the temple. Though a connected account of the history of administration is not possible, an attempt is made here to analyze the information from the few inscriptions on the subject.

There is no inscription of the Chola family which treats subject directly. But most of the Chola inscriptions give the names of the *Srikaryam* officers and also the names of *Alvar-kanmaigal* i.e., the Srivaishnavas who had a share in the administration of the temple. A glance at the list below will show that persons who appear to be high dignitaries were successively functioning as srikaryam officers during the Chola times while not as much is known about this aspect so far as the period of the Pandya rule is concerned.

It will be evident from the list above that good care had been exercised in the matter of controlling the affairs of temple. It appears that most of the *Srikaryam* officers in the time of Kulottunga I were persons appointed with royal consent, since the transaction in which they figure involved the approval of the revenue authorities. The inscription Nos. 27,31,32,34 and 37) in question mostly record the arrangements made to reclaim lands silted on account of the flood in the river Kaveri. The reclamation of these lands required some concession to be given to the cultivating tenants by way of remission of taxes till the land shad been brought under full and regular cultivation. The practice of appointing *Srikaryam* officers continued right up to the end of the reign of Kulottunga III (No. 147). The *Srikaryam* officer was assisted by a body called *Alvarkanmigal* consisting of two groups of six elected members each called Srivaishnava-variyam and Sribhandara-variyam and an officer called Srivaishnavakkandakka (No. 54).

With the change of the political conditions, this steady state of affairs in the temple appears also to have been affected. In the beginning of the thirteenth century, the activities of the Hoysals on the political front in the role of keeping up the balance of power between the waning cholas and the rising Pandyas appear to have caused some disturbance in the administration of the temple. Inscription No. 192, dated 1225 A.D., in the reign of Maravarman Sundara Pandya I refers in detail to the misappropriation of the capital funds in the temple and the remedial measures devised to set right this state if affairs. It is stated that a body comprising Jiyar Nararyanadasar, Alagiyasola brahamadhirayar described as *koyil-kurulaiyar, Srivashnavar* of
Periya-tiruppati, servants of the temple, *Sri-bhagavata nambimar, Sabhaiyar* of Tiru varangam, *Vinnappam Seyvar, Nambimar,*
