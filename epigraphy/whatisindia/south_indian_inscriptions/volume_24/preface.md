**PREFACE**

Sri-Ranganathasvamin temple on the island of Sri-Rangam in the Tiruchirapalli District of Tamil Nadu is one of the very important Vaishnava temples of India. On the walls of its prakaras and shrines, inscriptions ranging in date from the 10^(th) century are of absorbing interest and they throw valuable light on the history, religion, culture, economics, etc., of South India during a period of over a thousand years. So, it was considered worth while to publish all these inscriptions in a single volume for easy reference. The work while to publish all some time in 1946 and it was entrusted to Shri H.K. Narasimhasvami, Superintend for Epigraphy (Retd.) who then held the post of Senior Epigraphical Assistant. He was assisted by Shri V.S. Subrahmaniam as Pandit, a post specially created for the purpose. Being of great magnitude the work took a long time and it was completed in 1967. Shri K.G. Krishnan, Chief Epigraphist, who then held the post of Senior Epigraphical Assistant helped in a significant way in the finalization of the manuscript of volume especially in the preparation of its Introduction. The completed manuscript was lying in the Office of the Chief Epigraphist and I took up the matter of its printing with the Tamil Nadu Government Press, Madras as soon as I took charge of the post of Chief Epigraphist in 1976. Due to some reasons the Press was quite unwilling to undertake the printing of this volume, and I had to make special efforts in this regard which resulted in the press kindly accepting this and four other volumes for printing. My desire to see the volume printed off before I retired from my office did not fructify. Nevertheless, I am very happy that is now available in print after a lapse of about 34 years. I am sure that the volume will be found extremely useful by scholars of South Indian history and culture.
