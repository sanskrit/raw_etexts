This is damaged, and the last few lines are built in.

This is stated to be in *lieu* of 30 *kalam* of paddy they were till now paying to the temple every year evidently as interest on ten *palankasu* which had been originally invested with them as endowment for the that purpose, by a *samanta* (feudatory) of the Chola king Raja raja (III ?) by name Irunjirai-udaiyan.****
