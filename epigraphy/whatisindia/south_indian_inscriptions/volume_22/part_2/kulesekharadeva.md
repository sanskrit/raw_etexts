## KULESEKHARADEVA

**Tiruchirapalli District, Pudukkottai State, Perundurai.**

**(Near Tirumayyam)**

Stones containing this inscription are misplaced and some are lost. This seems to register an endowment of land (at Vellur) placed in-charge of the Srivaishnavas of the temple of Kandideva-Vinnagar at Perundurai in Kana-nadu, by Kandan Alagukanda-Perumal and his elder brother Kandan Aludaiyan *alias* Kalvayil â€“ Nadaslvan to provide for the worship of god Tavamukaiya-Pandisar consecrated by them (it is not clear where).

**Tiruchirapalli District, Pudukkottai State, Perundurai.**

**(Near Tirumayyam)**

**Satyagirinatha â€“ Perumal Temple â€“ On The Same Wall.**

**Tribh. Kulasekharadeva â€“ 13+9^(th) Year.**

Uninscribed stone is built into the body of this inscription and its continuation is lost. It seems to record a gift of some pieces of land made tax-free to the temple of Tyagamikama-Vinnagar â€“ Ember man at Perundurai by Kandan Aludaiyan Kalvayil â€“ Nadalvan, the chief who figures in No. 405 above.
