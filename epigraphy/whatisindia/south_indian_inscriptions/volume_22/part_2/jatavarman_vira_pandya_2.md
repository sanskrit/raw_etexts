**INSCRIPTIONS COLLECTED DURING THE YEAR 1906**

## JATAVARMAN VIRA PANDYAII

## **No. 356**

***(A .R. No. 356 of 1906)***

**Tiruchirapalli District, Pudukkottai State, Kudumiyamalai.**

**Sikhanathasvami Temple --- On The Same Wall.**

**Jat. Vira-Pandyadeva --- 11^(th) Year (A.D. 1263-64).**

This begins with introduction *Tirumagal valar â€“mulai* etc. It is left incomplete. It registers a royal order issued at the request of (Minister) Kalingarayar while the king was encamped at Karaiyur in Konadu, making a gift of the village Melmananallur together with all its dues and taxes like *kadamai, karpura-vilai* etc, to the temple of Tirunalakkunram â€“ udaiya â€“ Nayanan to meet the expenses of worship and other requirements of goddess Tirukkamakkotta-Nachchiyar who had been consecrated, it is said, by Nachchiyar the daughter of Durggaiyandal, evidently the same person mentioned in Nos. 352 and 353 above.****

**No. 360**

***(A .R. No. 360 of 1906)***

**Tiruchirapalli District, Pudukkottai State, Kudumiyamalai.**

**Sikhanathasvami Temple --- On The South Wall Of The Second *Prakara.***

**Jat. Virapandyadeva --- 15^(th) Year (A. D 1267-68)**.

The king is given the attribute â€œwho took ilam, Kongu and Chola mandalam and after conquering the powerful king was pleased to perform the anointment of heroes and victors at Perumbarrapuliyurâ€?. The inscription registers a sale, as *tirunamattukkani* to the temple at Tirunalakkunrum, of three *veli* of puravu (tax-paying?) land at Visalur by the *Urar* of that place, at the instance of two officers of the king (*Rajagomurruvar*) Vanadharayar and Gangeyar and on the intercession of the *Irandukarai-nattar,* for 64,000 *kasu.* The circum stances of the sale are given, from which it would seem that the *Urar* had been at default for a long period in the payment of the *kadamai-kilirai* and had also to account for 50,000 *kasu* which had evidently been deposited with them out of the amount intended for the renovation of the temple. This is probably the sale-proceeds of the transaction recorded in No. 352. A supplementary sale deed is added to this record figuring the *Nattar* as an agency and party for the execution of the sale.

## **No. 361**

***(A. R. No. 361 of 1906)***

**Tiruchirapalli District, Pudukkottai State, Kudumiyamalai.**

**Sikhanathasvami Temple --- On The Same Wall.**

**Jat. Vira Pandyadeva --- 15^(th) Year.**

The king gets the same attributes as in No. 360 above. The inscription is damaged. It records an agreement given by the *nattar* and the *sthanattar* of the temple of Tirunalakkunramudaiya â€“ Nayanar, to a certain individual (name lost) of Visalur, who had donated three *ma* of land to the temple, to the effect that they would supply 2 *kalam* Of rice and other requirements of the *Tiruppavadai-amudu* to the god on each of the four special festival days in the year, when the deity was taken in procession to the temple garden. Incidental mention is made of the conversion of a *devadana* land at Visalur into a *tirunamattukkani* of the temple by the *Nattar* and *Urar,* on which occasion this gift is said to have been made by the donor.

## **No. 375**

***(A. R. No. 375 of 1906)***

**Tiruchirapalli District, Pudukkottai State, Kudumiyamalai.**

**Melaikkoyil Rock-Cut Temple --- On The Side Of The Second *Gopura*, Left Of Entrance.**

This seems to record the acknowledgement (*taravu-muri*) of some help rendered by a certain Kudumiyar Udaiyapperumal of Sikaranallur in Tenkonadu to the *Urar* of Pulvayal and four other villages (Pulvayal Anjunilai) in return for which he got the accountancy of the 5 villages.
