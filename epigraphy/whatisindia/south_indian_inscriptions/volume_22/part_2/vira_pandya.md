This is damaged. The details of the date are given as Mesha, su. Sunday, Hasta probably corresponding to A.D. 1266, April 18. The *tithi* should be su.13. The epigraph states that as the temple at Tirunalakkunram (Kudumiyamalai) in Ko-nadu had gone out of repairs and there was no money for its renovation, the Nattar of Kana â€“ nadu and those connected with the temple administration sold a land called the *Iluppaikkudi-vayal* at Ammangainallur, which was a *tirunamattukkani* of the temple, to a certain *devaradiyal* of the temple by name Nachchiyar daughter of Durggaiyandal for 73300 *kasu.* Kana-nadu is said to be situated in Kunrusal-nadu a division of Ko-nadu also called Kadaladaiyadilangalkondasola-valanadu.

This is an interesting document. It states that the temple treasury of Tirunalakkunram Udaiya-nayanar had been burgled by priests who stole away the jewels and cash therefrom. The theft was found out and a meeting was called of all the (representative) inhabitants of the *nadu, nagaram* and *gramam* of the region, who held an enquiry into the offair. One of the priests by name Kunran Serundivanapperuman confessed to have taken 60 *pon* and shared it with a stonemason. He also implicated the others in the theft but they denied all knowledge of the matter. They were thereupon taken to a court at Mattukurichchi (?)
preside over by a *samanta* and ordered to prove their innocence before the assembled people by holding a red-hot iron in their hands. The ordeal went against them as their hands were burnt and they had to confess their guilt. The culprits were all pronounced as Siva *drohis* and they were deprived of their holdings at I luppaikkudi, which were now transferred to the temple as *Tirunamattukkani* with the cultivating right thereon (*koyil ulavu murruttu*). Such lands as had been sold by them to others were got back on payment of their cost by the temple and those held on mortgage were recovered without any compensation. Other private lands in the village were to continue their payment of the *achchuvari* and other taxes into the temple as usual.
