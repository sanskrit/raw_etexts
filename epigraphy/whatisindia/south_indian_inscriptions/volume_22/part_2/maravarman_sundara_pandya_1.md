The king claims the attribute â€œwho was pleased to take the chola countryâ€?, even in this third regnal year. The inscription registers a public sale of a piece of dry land at sikaranallur in Kunrusul-nadu a division of Ten-Konadu evidently by the *Urar* of the place represented by a committee of seven persons, and its purchase by Nambi Ponnambalakkuttan *alias* Udaiyan Sangeyarayar of Arrur in Sola-Pandya-Valanadu for 2 Â½ *palankasu.*

## **No. 379**

**Melaikkoyil Rock-Cut Temple --- On The Rock Behind The Vinayaka Shrine.**

**Tribh. Sundara Pandyadeva --- 201^(st) Year.**

The king is evidently Maravarman Sundara I (acc. A.D. 1216) as in No. 380 below. This registers a sale of 5 *ma* of land in the *devadana* village Tirumeyyam belonging to the temple of Tiruvikrama â€“ Cholisvaram â€“ udaiya â€“ Nayanar at Menmanainallur in Kunrisul â€“nadu by the trustees of the temple and the *Urar* of the place, for 3200 *kasu*, to Periyanachchi Duggai, a *devaradiyal* of the temple at Tirunalakkunram. The proviso of the sale given at the end is not clear.

**No. 380**

***(A. R. No. 380 of 1906)***

**Tiruchirapalli District, Pudukkottai State, Kudumiyamalai**

**Melaikkoyil Rock-Cut Temple â€“ In The Same Place.**

**Mar. Tribh. Sundara Pandya I â€“ 21+1^(st) Year (A.D. 1236-37).**

This records a similar sale of another piece of land, 5 *ma* in extent, in the same village, by the *Urar* and temple trustees to Umaiyalvi Periyanachchi. In this case they also agreed to pay the *kilirai* on the land on behalf of the purchaser for an additional sum of money received by them. It is possible that Periyanachchi was the mother of Duggai mentioned in No. 379 above.
