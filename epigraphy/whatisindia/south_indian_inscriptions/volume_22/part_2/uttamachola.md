**INSCRIPTIONS COLLECTED DURING THE YEAR 1906**

**UTTAMACHOLA**

## **No. 369**

***(A. R. No. 369 of 1906)***

**Tiruchirapalli District, Pudukkottai State, Kudumiyamalai.**

**Melaikkoyil Rock Cut Temple --- On The Rock To The South Of The Same Shrine.**

This is built in at the beginning. It is dated in the 9^(th) year of a king whose name is lost. It might probably be Uttama-Chola. It seems to record the gift of a quarter *(veli)* of land free of taxes as *devadana* to the temple of Kurrakkudi-Paramesvara by the *Urar* of Perunkurrakudi on an order received from Virasola-ilango \[velar\] (Kodumbalur chief) to provide for the daily offerings to the deity. Mention is made in the body of the record, of Madhurantakadeva.
