## **No. 348**

***(A. R. No. 348 of 1906)***

**Chingleput District, Kanchipuram Taluk, Uttukadu.**

**On The Same Stone (Reverse).**

The first two lines are in early Telugu script, the rest in being in Tamil. The inscription is damaged. It seems to record the offering by a man by name Iravi Achchal Bavadali (?) of his own head in sacrifice as propitiation for the successful completion of the tank. To the right of the epigraph is the squatting figure of a man with his left hand resting on his waist and the right cutting off his own head with a sword. From the top of the severed head --- curiously --- instead of from the neck, is gushing forth a stream of blood falling on his right side in the fashion of Ganga flowing from Sivaâ€™s head.
