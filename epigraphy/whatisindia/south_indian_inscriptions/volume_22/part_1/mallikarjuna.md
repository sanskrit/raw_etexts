**INSCRIPTIONS COLLECTED DURING THE YEAR 1905-1906**

**MALLIKARJUNA**

**No. 4.**



**(Page No. 4)**

***(A. R. No. 4 of 1906)***

**Chingleput District, Kanchipuram Taluk, Kanchipuram,**

**Ekamranatha Temple-On The Wall Of The Big Gopura.**

**Vira Maalikarjunadeva-Maharaya-Saka 1378.**

The details of the date are given as Saka 1378, Dhatu, Tula, su. 5, Friday hasta, which would correspond to A.D. 1456, October 4. But the weekday and nakshatra do not tally with *tithi.*

The inscription is left unfinished. It mentions a tax (?) called *Idangai-vari* and some land endowed to the temple of Tiruvegambam-udaiya-Nayanar in Kanchipuram, a nagara in Eyir-kottam, a division of Jayangondsola-mandalam.
