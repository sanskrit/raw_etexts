**(Page No 170)**

***(A. R. No. 216 of 1906)***

**South Arcot District, Tirukkoyilur Taluk, Perangiyur.**

**Ruined Siva Temple â€“ On The Same Wall.**

**Raj. Rajendra-Chola.**

This has a short introduction beginning with the words *Bumiyum Tiruvum.* It is damaged and also incomplete. It seems to register a sale of land by the assembly of peringur to the temple (for the expenses of worship) to god Pichcha-devar (Bhikshatana).****
