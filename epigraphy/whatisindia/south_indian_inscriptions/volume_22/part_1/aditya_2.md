The last few lines of the inscription are badly damaged. The sense of the Record is rather obscure. It seems to register the consecration of a temple of Mahadeva by Valaiyur-Nakkar Yogavanar a resident of Ranabhima-mangalam on the southern bank of the Pennai, and an endowment made for worship their in by Vanakovaraiyar Viraparumar the chief of Vanagappadi-nadu by means of taxation on the lands at that village. The uravar seem to have been made responsible for the collection and payment of the amount into the temple.
