This is damaged. It seems to record an endowment in money of 125 \[kalanju\] by some merchants of Kulasekharan-pattinam, to provide for the various require-Ments in connection with the worship of the deity in the month of Margali, in the temple of Kalakaladevar at Tirukkadavur. This place is referred to as a brahmadeya in the eastern division (kil-kuru) of Jayangondasola-valanadu.
