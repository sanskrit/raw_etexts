**INSCRIPTIONS COLLECTED DURING THE YEAR 1905-1906**

**PREFACE**

The present volume comprises 588 inscriptions collected during the year 1905-06 by the Epigraphical Branch. Though the manuscript of the volume was received as early as 24-4-1964, its printing could be taken up only in 1973. It is to be regretted that the editor Shri G.V. Srinivasa Rao passed away while the volume was still in the press. In view of the long delay in the printing of the volume, it was decided to have the volume published in two parts. The present one being the first part contains 302 inscriptions. The general introduction, the topographical and the dynastic indices have been included in the first part. The second part will contain the remaining 286 inscriptions and the general index.

Shri K. G. Krishnan, Chief Epigraphist (Retd.), Dr. M. D. Sampath, Dy. Superintending Epigraphist, Shri V. S. Subrahmaniam, Senior Epigraphical Assistant (Retd.), Dr. C. R. Srinivasan, Senior Epigraphical Assistant (at present Reader in epigraphy in the Tamil University at Tanjore) and S/S P. Venkatesan, R. Masilamani and S. Swaminathan, Epigraphical
Assistants were variously associated in checking the readings, correcting the proofs, visiting the press on specific assignments, etc.

Our thanks are due to Shri K. R. Srinivasan, Director, (Retd.), Archaeological Survey of India, for the keen interest he took in the printing of the volume.
