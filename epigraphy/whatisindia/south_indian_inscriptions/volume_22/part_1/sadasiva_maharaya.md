**INSCRIPTIONS COLLECTED DURING THE YEAR 1905-1906**

**SADASIVA MAHARAYA**

**No.66 (Page No 62)**

***(A. R. No. 66 of 1906)***

**South Arcot District, Kallakkurichchi Taluk, Tiruvarangam**

**Ranganatha Temple-On The Right And Left Walls Of The Entrance**

**Sadasivadeva-Saka 1480 (A.D. 1557).**

The details of date are given as Pingala, Kanni, su. 2, Revati, Friday, which yielf the equivalent A.D. 1557, September 10. but the tithi was ba.2. The record sates that on this day Mahamandalesvara Obaladeva-Maharaja, son of Konetayya-mharaja and grandson of Ramaraja Kondudeva-Maharaja of the Atreya-gotra, Yajus-sakha and Apastamba-sutta who had the *Nayakattanam* of Magadaimandalam conferred on him by the king, granted the income from three villages Eduttavanallur, madampundi and periya-pavandain Mudiyannur-parru for the several requirements of daily worship and offerings, and for the special festival occasions to god Ranganatha at Uttara-Tiruvrangam in the same parru (division). On the representation of one Tirumalainambi Sri ramayyangar to the chief, that the grant did not cover the full expenses incurred in the temple, the latter is said to have made an additional gift of the income from Padiyendal. Mudiyanur-parru is stated to be situated in magadaimandalam. It is also stated that it was situated in Tiruvadi-aiyam in magadaimandalam. Hence it seems likely that Tiruvadi-raiyam was a major division, the same as Meygunra-valnadu.

**Jambunatha Temple-On The Same Wall**

**â€˜Mahamandalesvaraâ€™ Sadasiva-Maharaja**

**Ananda (Saka 1477=A.D. 1155).**

This seems to record the gift of a house in the Nadutteru to the temple of tantonri-Aludaiyanayinar and some land to provide for offerings when the deity was taken in procession to this place. This service was probably entrusted to one unnamullai-Nayinar Ellappar.
