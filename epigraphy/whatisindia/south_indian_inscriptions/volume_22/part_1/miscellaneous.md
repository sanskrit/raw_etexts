**Ranganatha Temple On The Hill-In The Monolithic Cave**

**Forming The Central Shrine.**

This consists of a few Sanskrit birudas in the Pallava-Grantha script of about the 8^(th) century A.D. like those found for the Pallava king Mahendravarman I in the Pallavaram and Tiruchirapalli cave temples, and of two verses in Sanskrit both damaged. One of them seems to record the excavation of this cave temple called the Atiyendra-Vishnugriha by a king of the Atiyanavavaya (family) whose name is lost.It also makes mention of the grandsons by the daughter (dauhitras) of this king (?).
In the second verse we can read the names Sasi, Surya, Tumburu, Narada, madhu and Kaitabha. The images of these (and other) heavenly beings are actually found cut in relief on the walls of the temple.For a detailed description of this and the other two temples on the hill at this place, see the Annual Report on Epigraphy for 1906, Part II, Paragraphas 35 and 36.The following are the birudas mentioned above. utpala-karnika, Naravahana, Madana-vilasa, Manapara, Nayapara, Udarachitta, Prakritipriya and Naradeva.
