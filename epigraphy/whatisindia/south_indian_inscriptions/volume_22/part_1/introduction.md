**INSCRIPTIONS COLLECTED DURING THE YEAR 1906**

**Introduction**

Of the 588 inscriptions copied during the year 1906 by this office and included in this volume, 484 records are in Tamil. These epigraphs represent the collections secured from the various districts of Tamil Nadu and from the districts of Chittoor and Cuddapah in Andhra Pradesh.
Among them nearly about 40 records have been published elsewhere, while the texts of the remaining numbers are included here. They belong to the dynasties of the Cholas, Pandyas, Hoyasalas, Vijayanagara Kings and a number of chiefs such as those of Ummattur etc.

The earliest inscriptions are the cave records found incised on the Jaina caverns of the places like Marugaltalai, Anaimalai, Mangulam etc. They â€“(Nos.407, 457 and 460 to 465) Are assignable to the period from third century B.C. to the early centuries of the Christian ear. The inscriptions from Mangulam (Nos.460 to 465) are the earliest, which have been assigned to the third century B.C. shri K.V. subrahmanyam Ayyar, discussed first in detail on the Mangulam epigraphs in his elaborate paper on â€œThe earliest monuments of the Pandya Country and their inscriptionsâ€?, published in the proceedings of the 3^(rd) *All-India Oriental Congress* held in 1924. They have all been deciphered completely by Shri I. Mahadevan, subsequently, and published in the Seminar on *Inscriptions,* 1966, Madras (pp. 57 ff.)

The language of the inscription as pointed out by shri subrahmanya ayyar, is Tamil with prakrit words absorbed appropriately and the script is brahmi. Scholars are of the opinion that the Brahmi script used in the caves of Tamil nadu is an adaptation of Asoken Brahmi for writing Tamil language. The *varga* letters â€˜dhâ€™ and â€˜sâ€™ which are of common occurrence in the Asokan brahmi inscription are present in the expressions *dhammam and asiriya* in two of the Mangulam inscription (Nos.460and 465). The letter â€˜mâ€™ is written in the form of a horse-shoe shape with a cross bar connecting the two upright arms the letters â€˜tâ€™ has two forms, one with a straight stem from which angle

On the right branches off and the other with the two arms downward from out of the vertical main stem. Forms of letters peculiar to Tamil such as â€˜1â€™, â€˜1â€™, â€˜râ€™ and â€˜iiâ€™are found in these inscriptions.

Next to the cave inscriptions, the inscription No.7 found at the Ranganatha cave temple at Namakkal in salem District written in Sanskrit language and Grantha characters of the 7^(th) century A.D. deserves our attention. This consists of three pieces and along with a fourth price subsequently discovered in 1960-61 has been revised and edited in the Epigraphia Indica (Vol. XXXVI, pp. 131 ff. and Plate) The cave temple is described as a Sayya-griham, the sleeping apartment, with the reclining deity (Vishnu) surrounded by (the figures of) Markandeya, Garuda, Varuna, Brahma, Isa, Daksha, Sasi, Tumburu, Narada, Guru, Bhrigu, the five weapons, Sri and the demons Madhiu and Kaitabha. The sculptures carve in the central shrine agree with this description. The cave temple is called Atiyanatha-and-Aliyendra-Vishnugriham and is attributed to the authorship of gunasila (also called Soma?) an Atiya chief, the senior among the grandsons by the daughter of a king whose name is not clear. An interesting parallel is found in the name Kongavarman, and Soma family in describing the Kambuja King Bhavavarman. This architectural activity of excavating this cave-temple could have been possible only sometime before 750 A.D. when both the Pallavas and Pandyas were otherwise engaged.

An inscription (No. 402) on a stone set up in the Satyagirinatha temple at Tirumaiyam engraved in characters of about the 9^(th) century A.D. belongs to a Muttraiyar chief. It registers a grant probably of some land and village Andakaudi with the *Karanmai-miyatchchi* for the renovation of *Paudukkuppuram a*nd for the maintenance of the central shrine and as *unnaligaippuram*, respectively, by perumbiduguperundevi the mother of Videlvidugu Vilupperadiaraisan alias Sattan Maran. He was member of the Mutturaiyear family, who got the title *Videlvidugu* after Pallava Nandivaraman, probably as a subordinate. Shri K.G. Krishnan has identified Perumbidugu Perundevi as the queen of Cattan, the earliest known member of this Muttaraiyar family and has said that these chiefs had added to their official or dynastic designations the titles like *Videlvidugu* and *Perdumbiduga (studies in South Indian History and Epigraphy,* Vol. I, pp-133ff).

There is an interesting record from among the inscription of Parantaka I. One of the sides of a stone containing this does not mention the name of the ruling kind and his date (No. 348). But from the nature of its contents, it appears to be connected with the other side of the same slab, which refers to the 32^(nd) year (938-39 A.D.) of the reign of Parantaka I (No. 347). The dated record refers to the digging of a tank by Orriyur-Peruman, son of Narumanjira Kaliyotti of Urrukadu. A person by name Iravi A \[ch\]chal Pa\[va\]dali A\[na\]n is stated to have offered his head as a sacrifice probably for the successful completion of the above mentioned tank thus affording an instance of sacrifice made for public welfare. There is a picturesque portrayal of this incident on stone to the right of the epigraph.

Gramam in South Arcot District called Mudiyur in ancient time is believed to have been the head-quarters of a large army under the command of Prince Rajaditya. During the years between the 29^(th) (935-36 A.D.) and 39^(th) (945-46 A.D.) years of the King parantaka I, this prince is connected with the gifts made to the temple of Sri Arruttali Perumanadigal at Mudiyur which was reconstructed in stone by one of his generals Vellan Kumaran (A.D. Ep.1905, No. 735). Similarly the place Jambal in the same district is known as Valaiyur in the record of tenth century A.D. A *mandapa* in the name of the nagarattar is stated to have been raised by princess Viranaraniyar, the wife of *Pillaiyar* Gandaradittar and daughter (in-law) of Solamadeviyar, in the 34^(th) year (940-41 A.D.) of the reign of Parantaka I (No. 108). This body gave an undertaking to maintain the structure in good condition by means of an endowment of 70 kalanju of gold collected through tax and to maintain a lamp therein during nights from out of the interest accrued thereon.
