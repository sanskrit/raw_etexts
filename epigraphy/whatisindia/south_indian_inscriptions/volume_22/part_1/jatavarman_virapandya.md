**No. 45** (Page No. 43)

***(A. R. No. 45 of 1906)***

**Tanjavur District, Mayuram Taluk, Tirukkadaiyur**

**Amritaghatesvara Temple-On The Same Base**

**Jat. Vira-Pandya Deva-14^(th) Year.**

The details of the date given viz. Dhanus, ba. 10, Wednesday, Svati in the 14^(th) year of the king correspond to A.D. 1266, December 22. This records a communication addressed to the governing authorities of the temple of Kalakal-devar by one Kasipan Tiruchchirrambalamudaiyan-Bhattan, confirming the gift of two pieces of land measuring seven ma in extent at Perumulai in Vilanagar-nadu a division of Jayangondasola-valanadu, which he had made some time previously, and authorizing them to get the deed now engraved on stone and copper. The latter part of the inscription seems to register the actual execution of the document defining the boundaries of the land, among which is mentioned a land belonging to a temple called the Vikrama-Cholisvaramudaiyar.
