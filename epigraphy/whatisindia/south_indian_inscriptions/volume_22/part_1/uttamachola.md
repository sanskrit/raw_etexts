This is evidently an inscription of Uttama-Chola. It states that while the king was staying in his palace at Kachchippedu (Kanchipuram), it was represented to him through (the officer) Sola-Muvendavelan that the village Sirriyarrur in Manayil-nadu a division of Manaiyil-kottam had been granted, in the 21st year of Tondaimanarrur-tunjina-Udaiyar (Aditya I), as devadana-brahmadeya to the Sabha of Puduppakkam in Purisai-nadu in the same kottam with the stipulation that they were to pay as devadana-iraiyili to the temple of Tirumalperudaiyar 3000 kadi (of paddy) as puravu and 561 kadi as iravu in addition to 200 Â½ kalanju and a manjadi. This order had been confirmed in the 4th year of Parakesarivarman â€œwho took Madurai and Ilamâ€? viz., Parantaka I, excluding from its purview the lands in the village which had belonged to one Sangappadi-kilan, for which the owner was to pay independently 3000 kadi to the temple. This practice was in force till the 36th year of the king (Parantaka I), when the Sabha of Puduppakkam expropriated the lands of Sangappadi-kilan and discontinued the payment he was making. The temple authorities therefore now appealed to the reigning king against this injustice. The latter thereupon sent for the complainants and the Sabha of Puduppakkam, and after due enquiry into the matter passed orders to the Sabha to restore the payment in future to the temple, of the 3000 kadi also due on Sangappadi-kilanâ€™s land in addition to their own original dues of the puravu and iravu (rents) in paddy, and the cash payment they had been making. It was also ordered that this was to be entered in the Tax-Registers, and the order was issued to the temple authorities by the kingâ€™s officers including Parakesari-Muvendavelan and Sembiyan Uttaramantri.
