(Page No. 200)

***(A.* *R. No. 254 of 1906)***

**North Arcot District, Cheyyar Taluk, Tiruppanangudi.**

**Siva Temple â€“ On The Inner Side Of The West Wall Of The First *Prakara*.**

**Devaraya-Udaiyar (Devaraya I) Son Of Harihara II â€“ Saka 1320 (current)**

This inscription is badly damaged. It is dated in Isvara, Kanya, su. 10, Wednesday, Uttiram, corresponding to A.D. 1397, September 2, but the weekday was Sunday. It seems to register the sale of land by five persons to the *Uravar* of Kannippakkam for twenty *pon* for digging a feeder channel from the river to the irrigation tank of their village, after getting the latter repaired. Mention is made of Mahamandalesvara Samayadeva-Maharaja son of Vengi Tribhuvanamalla Chalukki-Narayana Suryadeva-Maharaja who was probably the regional administrator at the time.
