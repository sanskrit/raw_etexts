This reached the ears of Svamidevar (evidently the kingâ€™s preceptor) who found out their unworthiness and false pretensions and hence dismissed them from service and reappointed the previous and rightful incumbents of the posts, viz. Bharadvaji Brahmamaharajan Kuttappiran Kalavindodapanditan and Devapperuman saiva-surya-Brahmamaharajan and others for the conduct of worship in the two temples. He also restored to them the right and perquisites attached to their posts as they were in practice up to the 16th year of the king they were given in addition the Right of worship of the other deities also set up in the temple like Kalakaladevar, Kuttadumdevar, Kulottunga â€“Cholisvaramudaiyar and Vikrama â€“Cholisvaramudaiyar, on the representation of Vikramasola-Brahmamaharajan that this appointment may receive royal assent and be engraved on stone, the king now issued his orders to the temple trough his officers Rajanarayana-Muvendavelan and six others confirming the above arrangements.

The inscription begins with introduction Puyal vappa etc.The king is given the attribute â€œwho took Maduraj and was pleased to take the crowned head of the pandya (evidently Vira-Pandya)â€?. The details of the date are given as Mesha, su. \[8\], Thursday, Pushya (A.D. 1194, March 31). This registers the remission of taxes on a veli of temple land (Kasukolla-iraiyili) by the mahasabha of Tirukkada-vur, for the expenses of worship and offerings to god Rajaraja-isvaramudaiyar consecrated in the shrine to the west side of the Kalakaladevar temple, by Araiyan rajarajadevar alias Vanadharayar for the welfare of the king.This image of the deity is evidently different from the one mentioned in No. 41 above.
