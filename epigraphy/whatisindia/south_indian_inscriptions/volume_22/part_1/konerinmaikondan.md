The identity of the king is not clear. This records a tax-free gift of half a *veli* and odd of land at Erukkilantittai village near Akkur *alias* Rajendrasinga-chaturvedimangalam, for rearing a lotus garden for the supply of garlands to god Tirumayanam-Udaiyar at Tirukkadavur in Akkur-nadu and for the maintenance of the persons looking after the garden.

This records the kingâ€™s order to the tax-officers (Varikkuru-seyyar) communicated through the Secretary Rajendrasinga-Muvendvelan and 4 other officers, renewing the grant of a tax-free land 13 veli and odd in extent, situated in Rajadhiraja-mangalam which was a tax-free devadana and tirunamattukkani village belonging to god Tirumayanam-Udaiyar at Tirukkadavur. The land is said to have been converted into tirappu in the kingâ€™s 4th year and hence perhaps this present order of renewal.

**Tanjavur District, Mayuram Taluk, Tirumayanam**

**Brahmapurisvara Temple-On The Same Wall**

**Konerinmaikondan (?)-9th Year And 100th Day.**

This is engraved in continuation of the inscription No. 54 above, though it is evidently a separate and different record. It is dated in the 11th year and 169th day of an unspecified king, and registers a grant of land at Akkur after its Purchase by one Villavarayar of Perunallur for 10127 kasu, for the merit of the reigning king, to provide for the maintenance of persons who were to recite the Vedas and the Sri-Rudram in the temple of Tirumayanam-Udaiyar at Tirukkadavur, the exact significance of the term veda vinai is not understood. Perhaps the chanting of the Vedas was accompanied with the music o the vina.
Mention is made of two villages Tiruttondattugai-mangalam and Sivapadasekhara-mangalam.

**No. 55 (Page No. 51)**

**(A. R. No. 55 of 1906)**

**Tanjavur District, Mayuram Taluk, Tirumayanam**

**Brahmapurisvara Temple-On The Same Wall**

**Konerinmaikondan (?)-9th Year And 100th Day.**

This seems to register the grant of 2 pieces of land, one at Virasolanallur and the other at Virudarajabhayankaranallur and measuring together 23 Â½ \[veli\] in extent, to the temple of Tirumaiyanamudaiyar at Tirukkadavur, by order of the king. Mention is made of a flower garden called the â€œRajadhirajan tirunandavanam â€?which was to be formed out of one of these lands after its reclamation from sandy mounds. The record is left incomplete towards the end. A land settlement made in the 16th year of Kulottunga-Chola is referred to in the inscription.
