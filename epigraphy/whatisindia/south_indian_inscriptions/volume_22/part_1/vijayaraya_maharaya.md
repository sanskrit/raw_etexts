Vijayaraya-Maharaya â€œwho witnessed the elephant huntâ€? (Devaraya II?) saka 1368.The details of the date are given as Akshaya, Tula, su. 10. Friday avittam corresponding to A.D. 1446, September 30.

This is a copy of No. 23 of 1905 from Kilur. It states that as a result of (the forcible) collection of Kanikkai (presents) from the ryots of the *Valangai* and *Idangai* classes by the officers of state on each change of regime or administration (*manvantara*) the former became impoverished and ran away from their homes to other kingdoms consequently worship and festivals in temples ceased and the land became infested with disease causing intense mental anguish to the people. This reached the ears of the king who forthwith issued orders through Annappa-Udaiyar prohibiting such extortion of the *inavari* and *idangai*-vari in future and to get his command recorded on stone (throughout the state). As it was left out in some places people petitioned to Nagarasa-Udaiyar to rectify this omission. On receipt of his permission this is stated to have been engraved in this temple also in the presence of the members of the *nadu* (assembly) of Valudilam-pattu-chavadi, the karanika, the *parivara* and Tondaimanar Kachchiyarayar.
