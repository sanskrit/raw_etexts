This consists of twenty disjointed fragmentary pieces uniting (probably of more than one inscription). The introduction is that of Rajadhiraja I beginning with the expressions Tingaler taru etc. The inscription seems to record a gift of money by a private individual for burning a lamp in the temple of Mulasthanam-udaiyar, and the purchase of some land tax-free with that amount (by the temple) from the assembly of the place.

**No.233 (Page No 181)**

**North Arcot District, Cheyyar Taluk, Tirupanangadu.**

**Siva Temple â€“ On The North Wall Of The Talapurisvara Shrine.**

**Rajadhiraja I â€“ 3\[2\] nd Year (A.D. 1049-50)**

The inscription begins with introduction Tingaler taru etc. It registers a sale of land free of all taxes as devadana-iraiyili to the temple of Tiruppananga-dudaiyar at Vanpakkam in Kaliyurkottam by the assembly of Vallur in Kayiram-pedu nadu in the same kottam said to be a division of Jayangondasola-mandalam. The details of the transaction are lost in the damaged portion of the record. The cost of the land was probably collectively paid by some persons named in the inscription, as endowment for meeting the expenses of worship in the temple, and for feeding daily four Sivayogins and tapasvins.
