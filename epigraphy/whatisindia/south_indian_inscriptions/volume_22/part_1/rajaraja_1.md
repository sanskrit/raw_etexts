The short introduction lists only the victories of the king over the enemyâ€™s ships at Salai and his conquests of Gangapadi, Nulambapadi, Tadigaivali and Vengai-nadu. The inscription records an endowment of lands wet and dry in Kilur Village to the temple of Kalakaladeva by one Diran Kuttan alias Adichchapanma-Vilupparaiyan for the daily supply of 4 *nali* of milk, evidently for the sacred bath of the deity, for burning a perpetual lamp and for the akkaradalai offering to the God on the days of Sankranti.Among the boundaries of the land mention is made of a field (?) called Varaguna-vilagam.

This begins with the introduction Tirumagal pola etc., the details of the date given viz.Avani su.12, Saturday, Aslesha, give the equivalent A.D. 999, August 26, but the nakshatra was Sravana not Aslesha. The inscription records a grant of land by the Sabha of Kadavur to two persons by namePadasivan Ayirattannurruvan Kalakalan alias Kadavur-Velan and Raman Chandrasekharan alias Nurrenma-Velan probably to provide for the playing of musical instruments during the several services and for offerings, to the deity in the temple of Tiruvira-ttanattu Perumandigal.

**Tanjavur District, Mayuram Taluk, Tirukkadaiyur**

**Amritaghatesvara Temple â€“On The Same Wall**

**Rajaraja I â€“ 16th Year, (A.D. 1000-1)**

The details of date given viz.Mithuna, su. 5, Thursday, Asvati would give the probable equivalent A.D. 1001, May 29, f.d.t. 17. The nakshatra was however Aslesha, 80, and not Asvati. The record is incomplete. It seems to register a sale of land by the Sabha of â€œPadai-eviyaâ€? Kadavur in Ambar-nadu to a certain \[se\] mbiyan-Adigal-haturvedibhattan of the same village. Mention is also made of another person by name Baradayan-Adigal-Chaturvedibhattan who is stated to have been sent to Malai-nadu by Rajarajamarayar (evidently the king) on some mission.

**No. 27 (Page No 21)**

**Tanjavur District, Mayuram Taluk, Tirukkadaiyur**

**Amritaghatesvara Temple-On The Same Base**

**Rajaraja I â€“ 16th Year, (A.D. 1000-1)**

The details of date are given as Purattadi ba. 2, Monday, Purnarvasu (A.D.1000, Sept.23). The tithi should be ba. 8. This registers the sale of Â¾ veli and odd of land as tirunamattukkani to the temple of Tiruvirattanam-Udaiya-Paramasvami by the Sabha of Kadavur. It seems that some money was due to the palace by way of a lady of Manjanattaru-velam. The amount had doubled itself into 30 pon in course of time, and some members of the Samaraskesari-terinja Kaikkolar who were ordered to collect the debt, put severe pressure upon the sabha of the village to do so.brahmasrirayan had died in the meanwhile and the sabha sought out a jnati of his by name Samanta-Tanikar who, however, disowned any responsibility towards his deceasedâ€™s son Viranaryanan Sivan and the lattersâ€™ nephew Pullan Viranarayan Since these two could not be found, the property was taken over (?) exparte in lieu of the amount due and was sold to the temple. The inscription is damaged and left income towards the end.
