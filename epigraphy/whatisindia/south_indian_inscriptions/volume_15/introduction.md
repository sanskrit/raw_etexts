**BOMBAY-KARNATAKA INSCRIPTIONS**

**INTRODUCTION**

**O**f the inscriptions on stone collected between 1926 and 1931 in the Karnatak area of the former Bombay Presidency, as many as 211 epigraphs were published in the *South Indian Inscriptions,* Volume XI (*Bombay Karnatak Inscriptions,* Volume I), Parts I and II. Almost all the remaining inscriptions of this five years collection have been incorporated in the present volume. The total number of inscriptions now published runs to 771. These inscriptions can be divided broadly under the following sections with reference to their subject-matter;

(1)The Chalukyas of Kalyana, (2) The Kalachuris, (3) The Yadavas, (4) The Hoysalas, (5) The Sindas, (6) The Kadambas, (7) The Vijayanagara Kings, (8) The Muslim rulers, (9) The Marathas, (10) The East India Company and (11) Miscellaneous.

A detailed study of these records will surely yield many fruitful results for the scholars working in various fields, such as epigraphy, dynastic history, chronology, ancient, geography, social life, religion, education, literature and language. However, within the limited scope at our disposal, it is proposed to review here briefly some of the main facts of political history brought to light by these epigraphs for the benefit of the students of history.

**The Chalukyas of Badami**

Although this dynasty is not directly represented in the present collection and no inscription can be assigned definitely to any particular ruler of this family, a number of short inscriptions comprising descriptive labels, found at Badami proper and in the adjoining places like Mahakuta, Aihole and Pattadakal fall within the regime of these rulers and some of them seem to contain interesting contemporary references to the members of the royal house, feudatory chiefs, artists, teachers, and persons distinguished in other walks of life. For instance, Nos. 441-42 speak of one and the same individual Bhimasakti, a chief of the Sendraka family. He figures once again in No.443, whrrein he is described as one devoted to the pair of feet of the illustrious Satyasraya. As the title *Satyasraya* was commonly attributed to the princes of the early Chalukya family, it is difficult to identify this king with any particular ruler, although it is tempting to surmise that he might be Pulakesin II on account of his more familiar association with it. His subordinate Sendraka Bhimasakti is not known from any other source and his relation with the known members of this family cannot be ascertained in the absence of more details (of*. Arch.Surv.An. Rep.,* 1928-29, p. 117;*Ep.Ind.,* Volume XXVIII, p.199).
Among the records of this category may be noted a few more, such as *Sri-Juddha-vikraman* (No.424), *Sri-Vikkarasan* (No.426), *Sri-Ranaparakraman* (No.430) and *Prati-Vikrama* (No.401), Sarvasiddhi-acharya (No.488) and Nirmanadeva Pullappan (No.487) appear to have been renowned as great artists.

The inscription (No.489) on a pillar at Pattadakal in the Badami taluk seems to shed some welcome light on the dark period of the history of this family after the subjugation of Kirtivarman II by Dantidurga, the founder of Rastrakuta sovereignty. It is engraved in archaic Kannada characters of about the 8^(th) century and purports to state that the pillar was the gift of *Maharaja* Taila who was an administrative officer of the region (*Pergade).* The association of the high-sounding title *Maharaja* once more with this dignitary in this brief epigraph points to his exalted position and it would not be unreasonable to identity him with Taila I, nephew of Kirtivarman II (*of. Arch.Sur.An.Rep.,*loc.cit.).

There is an inscription at Sondekola in the Chitaldrug District (*Ep.Carn.,*Vol.XI, Cd.25), which mentions a Vikramadityadeva and cites the date Saka 893, Pausha su. 13, Sunday, Uttarayana-sankranti. This date is irregular; but it can broadly be equated to 971 A.D. Rice has sought to identify this Vikramadityadeva with Vikramaditya IV, father of Taila II (*ibid.,* Introduction, p.10). The grounds for such an identification are not quire convincing.[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_15/preface.html#_ftn1)

Very little is known about the other members of this family until we come to Tailia II who re-established Chalukya supremacy in Karnataka.
An epigraph from Narsalgi in the Bagewadi Taluk shows that Taila II was a. subordinate of Rashtrakuta Krishna III and that in 965 A.D., he was governing the tract of Tardavadi Thousand represented by the modern Bijapur District (*S. I.I.,* Vol. XI, Part I, No.40). It might be this same Taila II who figures nine years earlier in an inscription from Karjol in the Bijapur taluk, dated 956 A.D. , which mentions Tailapayya as governing the Nadu (i.e., territory) under the same Rashtrakuta monarch (B.K. No.178 of 1933-34). From these notices, though scanty, it appears that the sphere of activity of the members of the Chalukya house, after they had lost their independent status, was confined mainly to the Bijapur territory which was their ancestral home.

**The Rashtrakutas of Malkhed**

As in the case of the Chalukyas of Badami, the present collection contains no record having a clear bearing with the rulers of the dynasty. But incidentally some interesting side lights on the history of this family are furnished by the records of a later period. No.

No.46 from Salavadigi belongs to the reign of Jagadekamalla II. But in its preliminary description it narrates events that took place in the times of the Rashtrakutas. In this context we are introduced to a dignitary named Horeyama serving under Subhatunga-Vallabha Akalavarsha Krishnaraja who has to be identified with Krishna II. This Horeyama is praised as *Samantagrani* (supreme among the feudatories) and the fierce sword in the hand of his master Krishnaraja. He is also said to have been holding the office of *Talara* of Manykheda.
