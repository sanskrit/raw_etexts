**(B.K. No.19 of 1927-28)**

**KARMADI, RON TALUK, DHARWAR DISTRICT**

On a stone learning against the front wall of Somesvara temple

**Somesvara I, 1059 A.D.**

The inscription commences with the praise of Ahavamalla or Somesvara I who appears to have been the reigning king. It is dated Saka 981, Vikari, Vaisakha su. 1, Friday, corresponding to 1059 A.D., April 15.
The weekday, however, was Thursday.

It registers a gift of money for maintaining a feeding house and for worship and offerings, etc., in the temple of the god Babbalesvara by Gangeya-jiya of Kadirmidi who were to utilise only the interest accruing from the amount for the said purpose, The earlier damaged part of the epigraph mentions a previous date, viz., Vilambi, Magha and solar eclipse. This corresponds to 1059 A.D., February 15. The gift seems to have been announced formally on this occasion and it might have taken effect actually two months later.
