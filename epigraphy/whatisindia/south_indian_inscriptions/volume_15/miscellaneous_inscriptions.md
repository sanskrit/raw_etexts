## **KIRSUR, BAGALKOT TALUK, BIJAPUR DISTRICT**

On a fragment of a slab built into the wall of the Ramalinga temple

**Circa 11^(th) Century**

The inscription commences with the Chalukya *prasasti* which is partly preserved, the kingâ€™s name being lost. It introduces a member of the Sinda family of Bagadage whose name, however, is missing. It mentions Kundi Three Thousand. The record is fragmentary and all other details are lost.

**No.81**

**(B.K. No. 79 of 1928-29)**

**GALGALI, HUNGUND TALUK, BIJAPUR DISTRICT**

On a broken stone built into the wall of a house near the Parvatesvara temple

**1101 A.D.**

This is dated the Vira-Vikrama year 26, Vrisha su. 1, Sunday, them month possibly being Pushya. Vira-Vikrama year evidently stands for the Chalukya-Vikrama year. In the said cyclic year, su. 1, Sunday occurred only in the month of Adhika Bhadrapada, though in Pausha, su. 1, commencing on Sunday, ended on Monday. The details may be equated to 1101 A.D. July 28, taking the month to be Adhika Bhadrapada.

The epigraph seems to commemorate Kannasetti who died in a defensive fight against the aggressors. It mentions Tarddavadi-nadu and Niduvane. The inscription is damaged and fragmentary.

On a hero-stone in front of the Ramalinga temple

**1106 A.D.**

This is dated the Chalukya vikrama year 31, Vyaya, Sravana su.
Thursday. If the lost *tithi* is *dasami*, the details correspond to 1106 A.D., July 12.

It seems to record the death of Chavagavunda and Holligavunda in a fight against the forces of Chagaladevi, wife of a chief of Toragale.
