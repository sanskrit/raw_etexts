**No.171**

**(*B.K. No.* 65 o*f* 1929-30)**

**TALIKOTI, MUDDEBIHAL TALUK, BIJAPUR DISTRICT**

On a pillar in the Ramasvami temple

**Singhana, 1225 A.D.**

This is dated the 26^(th) regnal year of the king, Parthiva, Ashadha, su. 5, Monday corresponding to 1225 A.D., June 12. The weekday, however, was Thursday.

It records a gift of land to the god Svyambhu Somanatha of Taliyakote by *Mahamandalika Magaramurari* Jayitapalanayaka and Manikadevi. The gift seems to have been made in the course of an expedition in the Hagarattage-nadu.

**No.172**

**(B.K. No. 79 of 1927-28)**

**DONI, MUNDARGI TALUK, DHARWAR DISTRICT**

On a pillar in front of the Donikkavva temple

**Singhana, 1226-27 A.D.**

This inscription states that the Sibara, i.e., pillar, whichwas not in existence for the past 770 years, was erected by Madavari Basavayya in the cyclic year Vyaya, the 16^(th) year after Simhana entered the country. The cyclic year Vyaya in Simhanaâ€™s reign correspondd to 1226-27 A.D.

**No.173**

**(B.K. No. 89 of 1929-30)**

**HEBBAL, BAGEVADI TALUK, BIJAPUR DISTRICT**

On a slab standing before the Virabhadra temple

**Singhana, 1229 A.D.**

This is dated in the 42^(nd) regnal year of the king, Virodhi, Karttika-amavase, Monday. The said *tithi* of the cyclic year Virodhi faling in the reign of Singhana corresponds to 1229 A.D., November 17.
But the weekday was Saturday. The renal year 42 as engraved on the stone appears to be a mistake for 32. The date portion also mentions eclipse and Sankramana, which are superfluous.

It records a gift of land to the god Mulasthana by Devarasa, the *Mahaprabhu* of Hebbala.

**No.174**

**(B.K. No. 30 of 1927-28)**

**KODAGANUR, RON TALUK, DHARWAR DISTRICT**

On a stone built into the wall of the Virabhadra temple

**Singhana, 1232-33 A.D.**

This mentions the cyclic year Nandana which corresponds to 1232-33 A.D. in the reign period of the king.

It refers to Doddesvara of Muduvalal and the teacher Balla-guru. It also mentions Kodaganur. The inscription is damaged and the details are lost.

**No.175**

**(B.K. No. 11 of 1929-30)**

**DHAVALGI, MUDDEBIHAL TALUK, BIJAPUR DISTRICT**

On a stone lying near the village chavadi

**Singhana, 1235-36 A.D.**

This is dated the 26^(th) year, Manmatha, other details being lost. As the 26^(th) regnal year of the Yadava king Singhana corresponded with Manmatha the inscription may be assigned to his reign. Its equivalent would be 1235-36 A.D.
