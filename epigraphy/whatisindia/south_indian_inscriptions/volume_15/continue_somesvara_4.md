**KONNUR, BILGI PETHA, BIJAPUR DISTRICT**

On a broken slab set up near the village chavadi.

**Somesvara IV, 1188 A.D.**

The record mentions *Chalukya-pratapa-Chakravarthi* and is dated the cyclic year Kilaka, Asvayuja ba. 1, Friday. In the later period of the Chalukya regime the details correspond only to 1188 A.D., October 7, Friday, f.d.t., 38, when Somesvara IV was reigning. The record may therefore be assigned to this king.

It records a gift of toll incomes on certain articles. The inscription is damaged and the details are lost.

**No.72**

**(B.K. No. 196 of 1928-29)**

**ANNIGERI, NAVALGUND TALUK, DHARWAR DISTRICT**

**Somesvara IV, 1186-88 A.D.**

The inscription bears two dates : (1) 5^(th) regnal year of the king, Parabhava, which corresponds to 1186-87 A.D. (2)6^(th) regnal year of the king, Plavanga, correspondting to 1187-88 A.D. It is not possible to give the precise equivalents of the dates, as the details are lost.

It records, on the first date, the remission of tax on the lands of the *Brahmanas* in the five *Brahmapuris* of Annigere made by *Dandanayaka* Kesirajayaa, the *Perggade* of Belvala-nadu, who was an officer of Ballaya-Sahani, in the presence of the *Karanas, Trivargasamaya* and the body of One Thousand.

It describes the genealogy of the Chalukya kings and mentions Bammideva, Lingadeva, Vishnu-dandanatha, Raya-dandanatha and other officers. Annigere is praised as the crest jewel of the province of Eradarunuru. Most of the composition is in Kannada, but a few Sanskrit verses are also inserted. The record is damaged and many passages are worn out.

**No.73**

**(B.K. No. 145 of 1926-27)**

**HOMBAL, GADAG TALUK, DHARWAR DISTRICT**

On a slab set up in the temple of Sankaralinga

**Somesvara IV, 1189 A.D.**

The record is dated the 3^(rd) regnal year of the king, Saumya, Sravana su. 10, Monday, Sankramana. The date corresponds to 1189 A.D., July 24. But there was no Sankramana on that day. The regnal year cited would yield 1187 A.D., as the initial year of the king which is rather too late.

It registers a gift of land made by the teacher Rudrasakti of the Kalamukha order after purchasing it from the One Hundred and Twenty *Mahajanas* of Pombulcha for worship and offerings in the temple of Kumara-Bontesvara constructed by him in the *agrahara* of Pombolal in memory of his preceptor Vamasakti. The record describes a line of teachers of the Kalamukha sect in the Belleya-santana and Parvata-vali as follows : Bonteyamuni to whom are attributed several miracles one of which is said to have been performed in the court of Jayasimha-Chakravarti. His chief disciple was Avadhuta who had the following junior colleagues, Kedarasakti, Mallikarjuna, Murujavi, Nirvanayogi, Vamadeva or Vamasakti, Siddhesvara, Rudrasakti and Kriyasakti. Vamasakti had three disciples, viz., Bonteyaguru, Mallikarjuna, and Rudrasakti, the donor. Various other gifts made to the same deity on the same occasion by the local *artists.
Aruvattokkalu,* merchants, etc., are also recorded. Pombulcha and Pombolal occurring in the inscription are the earlier forms of the name of Hombal. The epigraph is also interesting on account of its literary merit.

**No.74**

**(B.K. No. 5 of 27-28)**

**KODIKOPPANAGUDDA, RON TALUK, DHARWAR DISTRICT**

On a slab leaning against the wall to the left of entrance Into the central shrine of Kalakalesvara

**Somesvara IV, 1194 A.D.**

This is dated the 10^(th) regnal year of the king, Prajapati, Karttika-punnami, Monday. The date is irregular including the wrong citation of the cyclic year. The 10^(th) year of the king coincides with Ananda, when the details regularly correspond to 1194 A.D., October 1, Monday. On this day there was a lunar eclipse which is not mentioned in the record.

It registers a gift of land by the kingâ€™s subordinate *Mahamandalesvara* Achideva for offerings, etc., in the temple of Kalakalesvara. The genealogical succession of the donot is given as follows : Acharsa I, his son Bammarasa, the formerâ€™s brother Singaâ€™s son, Acharsa II, (his son) Chavunda and (his son) Achideva.
It becomes thus evident that this Achideva belonged to the Sinda family of he Erambarage branch. Cf. *Epiraphia Indica,* Vol. XX, p. 114.

**No.75**
