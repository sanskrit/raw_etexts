**BOMBAY-KARNATAKA INSCRIPTIONS**

**INTRODUCTION**

**The Hoysalas**

**. . . . . O**f the 18 inscriptions of this family sixteen belong to the reign of Vira-Ballala II. The remaining two which are wanting in details on account of their damages state, have also to be assigned to this ruler, as no other king of the family is known to have been in possession of this northern area and left his records here. A scrutiny of the epigraphs bearing dates in his regnal and cyclic years shows that this king commenced his reckoning from Virodhikrit or 1191-92 A.D. His inscriptions have been found in the Mundargi, Gadag, Navalgund and Ron Taluks of the Dharwar District and the Yalbargi Taluk of the Raichur district, indicating the extent of his northern boundaries.
Vira-Ballala succeeded to his ancestral throne in 1173 A.D. and his earlier records do nto allude to his reckoning. In an inscription at Kaulur in the Koppal Taluk of the Raichur District, dated 1179 A.D., he is introduced as a subordinate of Kalachuri Sankama and styled *Mahamandalesvara.[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_15/introduction1.html#_ftn1)* So it becomes clear that the above commencement of his regnal reckoning marks his conquest of the northern regions and assumption of sovereignty. From its allusions in the Gadag record (No.207) and other inscriptions, Lokkigundi or modern Lakkundi attained prominence as a suitable camping place of this king in the course of his military operations. Fleet observed that the Nagavi inscription citing his 21^(st) year and dated October 23, 1211 A.D., was the last record of this king who, it was thought, died soon after this date (*Bomb.Gaz.,* Vol. I, Part II, p.506). But we have a subsequent record from Lakkundi in our collection (No.221) mentioning his 22^(nd) year and dated April 15, 1212 A.D. Vira-Ballala, in fact, lived as late as 1220 A.D. and the absence of his records of dates later than 1212 A.D. in this region has to be attributed not to his demise, as Fleet surmised, but to the aggressive campaigns of his powerful adversary, Yadava Singhana, who must have repulsed the Hoysala forces and pursued them as far south as the river Kaveri in the neighbourhood of which his general Bichana is said to have set up a pillar of victory (*J.B.B.RA.S.,* Vol.XV, p.385).
No.218 from Hosur, dated 1207 A.D., introduces Chikka-Narasingayya, described as the kingâ€™s second son and *Sarvadhikari.* Not much is known about the other son of Vira-Ballala and it might be this Chikka-Narasingayya who succeeded to the Hoysala throne after his father as Vira-Narasimha or Narsimha II.

**The Sindas**

The Sendrakas and the Sindas whose traditions differ in certain respects appear to have belonged originally to a common stock, although it has not been possible to trace a closer relationship between the two. The Sindas figure prominently more often in the epigraphic records of a comparatively later date. But it is possible to show that the chiefs bearing these cogomen flourished side by side in the early mediaeval period. This is illustrated by a recently discovered inscription at Kuknur, of the time of Vikramaditya I (655-80 A.D.) which mentions a local chief by name Sindarasa as administering the tract (*A. R. Ep.,* 1955-56, Appendix B, No.212). It may be noted here that Kuknur is about 10 miles from Yalbargi or old Ebagadage where an important family of the Sinda chiefs ruled during the 11^(th) and the 12^(th) centuries.
Another Sindarasa administrating Panthipura or Hangal is met with in an inscription of Kirtivarman II (*circa* 750 A.D.) **From Adur in the Dharwar District (*Karnatak Inscriptions,* Vol I, No.3).

Various branches of the sinda family were ruling in different parts of the country. An early branch was stationed at Bagadage which is modern Bagalkot. An inscription at Bhairanmatti (No.3), after narrating the legendary origin of this family, furnishes a historical account of its later members. See *Ep.Ind.,* Vol. III, pp 230 ff ; *Bomb. Gaz.,* Vol. I, Part II, pp.576-77.

The Sindas of Erambarage of or Yalbargi[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_15/introduction1.html#_ftn2) figure in a good number of inscriptions now published in this volume.
With the help of some of these records, briefly noticed before, as well as others, Fleet, Barnett and Panchamukhi have tried to reconstruct the *Ep.Ind.,* Vol.XIV, pp.268 ff. and Vol. XX, pp.109, ff. A few additional points relating to the family are discussed here in brief.

Permadi, son of Achugi II, had the title *Jagadekamalla.* Only three inscriptions seem to indicate that they were issued while he was ruling. But two of these quote dates which do not suit him (*S.I.I.,* Vol. XI, Part II, Nos.119 and 155). So No.28 of 1144 A.D. from Kodikop in this volume appears to be the only reliablecontemporary record of this chief. Of the two epigraphs from Nidagundi wherein, according to Panchamukhi, the Sinda queen Siriyadevi is said to figure as the regent of her young sons, Bijjala and Vikrama (*Ep. Ind.,* Vol. XX, p.113), only one inscription actually mentions the fact and this (No.117, B.K. No.208 of 1926-27) is dated December 28, 1174 A.D., the two princes were fully invested with royal authority and we find them ruling the chiefdom jointly. Two inscriptions, one from Kanvi (No.121, and another from Harti (No.120), bearing the identical date, October 22, 1173 A.D., introduce Vira-Bijjala as the ruling chief and refer to his 7^(th) regnal year. This would show that his reign was counted from 1167 A.D. which falls in the reign period of his father Chavunda. It may be surmised from the foregoing evidence that Vira-Bijjala, being the elder of the two brothers, was authorised to associate himself with the administration during the life time of his father and that the joint rule of the two brothers commenced some time after December 28. 1171 A.D., The last date of the joint rule of Vira-Bijjala and Vira-Vikrama as known from our records is *circa* 1187 A.D. (No.242).
