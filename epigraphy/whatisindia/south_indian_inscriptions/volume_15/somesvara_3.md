**\[Bhulokamalla\] (Somesvara III), 1135 A.D.**

The record contains two dates. The first is Saka 1056, Ananda, Pushya-amavasya, Solar eclipse, Sunday, corresponding to 1135 A.D., January 16. The week-day, however, was Wednesday. The second date is chalukya-Vikrama year 10, Dundubhi, Ashadha su. 8, Monday, corresponding to 1082 A.D., June 6.

The first section of the inscription containing the first date, recounts the Kadamba *prasasti* and states that Jayakesi II of the Goa Kadamba family along with his queen Mailala-mahadevi, was governing the kingdom from the *nelevidu* of Bhoguru. While citing the date it makes a passing reference to Bhuloka, i.e. Bhulokamalla.

It registers a gift *vrithis* OWNED BY HIM TO THE GOD Mulasthana of Posavolal by Hallagavunda after washing the feet of Nagarasi-pandita, son of Devarasi-pandita.

The second section coming at the end and citing the second date, registers a similar gift to the same deity. This seems to be a renewal of an earlier transaction.[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_15/somesvara_3.html#_ftn1)
