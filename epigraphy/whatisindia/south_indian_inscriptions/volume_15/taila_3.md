**No.47**

**(*B.K. No.* 33 *and* 21 *of* 1928-29)**

**ARASIBIDI, HUNGUND TALUK, BIJAPUR DISTRICT**

On a slab set up in front of the Jaina Basadi**

**Trailokyamalla (Taila III), 1151 A.D.**

This is dated the Vikrama year \[76\], Prajapati, Pushya ba. 2, Wednesday, Uttarayana-samkranti, corresponding to 1151 A.D.,December 26, f.d.t. 07. The Uttarayana-samkranti, however, occurred on the previous day. The Vikrama year evidently means he Chalukya-Vikrama year.

It records that *Mahamandalesvara* Chaundarsa of the Sinda family governing Kisukadu Seventy and other regions (details lost) made a gift at the town of Erambarate at the request of his queen Demaladevi. The recipients of the gift were Devanandi-pandita and Nemichandra-pandita, who belonged to Mula-samgha, Kundakund-anvaya. Desiya-gana and Pustaka-gachcha.

The record is very much damaged.

**No.48**

**(B.K. No. 54 and 21 of 1926-27)**

**LAKKUNDI, GADAG TALUK, DHARWAR DISTRICT**

On a beam of the Kasivisvanatha temple

**Tribhuvanamalla (Tail III), 1152(?) A.D.**

This is dated the 3^(rd) regnal year of Chalukya-Vikrama Charkravarti Tribhuvanamalla, Prajapati, Pushya-amavasya, Sunday, Uttarayana-samkramana.

The inscription may refer to the reign of Vikramaditya VI, but his 3^(rd) regnal year did not fall in Prajapati. The 3^(rd) regnal year Prajapati, however fits in for the reign of Tail III. In that case, we have to assume that Tribhuvanamalla was Somesvara IV and that he was associated with his father Tail III in the the administration of the kingdom from the beginning. Pushya-amavasya in Prajapati would thus correspond to 1152 A.D., January 8, which was Tuesday. The Uttaryana-samkramana did not occur on this *tithi*, but on the *Paurnima* day if that month.

The epigraph registers a gift of gold made by Perggadeyara Tribhuvanakesava described as the â€˜dear sonâ€™ of the Thousand *Mahajanas* of Lokkigundi for the offerings to the god Kavatalesvara.
The gift was entrusted to Somesvara-pandita, the *acharya* of the temple. A gift of land for the offerings to the same god made by Sovisetti is also recorded.

It records the gift of income derived from cess of various commodities to the god Gavaresvara made by *Mummuridanda* and *Aivattokkalu* of Hiriya Kurihatti which was a *sarvanamasyada agrahara* created by Tribhuvanamalla (Vikramaditya VI). The epigraph is much damaged.
