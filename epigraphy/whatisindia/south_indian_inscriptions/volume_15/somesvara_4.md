**TALIKOTI, MUDDEHIHAL TALUK, BIJAPUR DISTRICT**

On a pillar set up near the gateway of the fort

**Somesvara IV, 1184 A.D.**

The epigraph is dated the 3^(rd) regnal year of the king, Krodhi, Vaisakha su. 13, Monday, corresponding to 1184 A.D., April 25. The weekday, however, was Wednesday.

It records the gifts of land, house-site, shop, gardens, oil mill, incomes from toll on certain articles of sale, and one *gadyana* each from all the villages in the district of Hagaritage-300, made by *Mahamandalesvara* Viruparasa. The gifts were entrusted into the hands of Vira-Dasa for conducting worship and offering on behalf of the *Ganas* in the temple of Vira-Baysesvara and for maintaining a *Gana-matha.* These *Ganas* of Saiva traditions, who seem to have belonged to the new school of Saivism, are described as having established the glory of the god Siva by destroying the Buddhist and Jaina creeds, vanquishing the advocates of the rival faiths at Pariyalige, Anilevada, Unukallu, Sampagavi, Abbaluru, Marudige, Anampuru, Karahada, Kembavi, Bammukuru and other places in distant lands, demolishing the Jaina temples and enthroning *Sivalingas* with supreme valour. Mention is made of Taliyakore (modern Talikoti) while descrbing the boundaries of the gift land.
