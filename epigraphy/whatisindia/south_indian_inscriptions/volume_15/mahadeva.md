**No.195**

**(*B.K. No.* 7 o*f* 1930-31)**

**INGALESVAR, BAGEVADI TALUK, BIJAPUR DISTRICT**

On a slab built into the east wall of the Narayanadeva temple

**Mahadeva, 1265 A.D.**

This is dated Saka 1â€¦, Krodhana, Margasira ba. 10, Friday, Sankrama. The year Krodhana falling during the reign of Mahadeva, occurred in Saka 1187. But in this year the given details of the date do not agree. The said *tithi* corresponds to 1265 A.D., December 3, the week-day being Thursday. There was no Sankramana on this day.

It registers the gift of land, a shop and an oil-mill by the Two Five-hundred (*Mahajanas)* of Inglesvara to the god Gopinatha of Urodegeri. Other gifts to the same deity by *Telliga-ayvattokkalu,* Vimchuva-Basavarasa, the *Sunkadhikari* of Taddavadi Thousand, etc., are also registered. Ingalesvara is described as the foremost *Bananjupattana* of Taddavadi Thousand, and is said to be an *agrahara* donated by Janamejaya and called Dakshina-Varanasi.

**No.196**

**(B.K. No. 16 of 1927-28)**

**YAONGAL, RON TALUK, DHARWAR DISTRICT**

On a stone built into the wall of Malevadadavara-matha

**Mahadeva, \[1271 A.D.\]**

The damaged date portion of the record contains the letters *pati* of the cyclic year, Sravana su. 6, Tuesday. This remnant may be taken to be a part of the full name Prajapati. this cyclic year, corresponding to Saka 1193, was the last year of Mahadevaâ€™s reign. On this assumption the date may be equated to 1271 A.D., July 14, Tuesday, f.d.t. 08.

It seems to register a gift of land to a deity made into the hands of *Rajaguru,* Chandrabhushana-yati. The deity Bhogesvaraditya is mentioned while definig the boundaries of the gift land. The inscription is badly damaged.
