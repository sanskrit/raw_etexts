**No.209**

**LAKKUNDI, GADAG TALUK, DHARWAR DISTRICT**

On the doorway leading to the well called Siddhara-bhavi

**Vira-Ballaja II, 1195 A.D.**

The record is dated ther 3^(rd) regnal year of the king, Ananda, Chaitra-amavasya, solar eclipse, Sunday. In the cyclic year Ananda falling in the reign of Vira-Ballala, no solar eclipse occurred. A solar eclipse occurred on Chaitra-amavasya of the next year, i.e. Rakshasa. Thus assuming Ananda to be a mistake for Rakshasa, the given date corresponds to 1195 A.D. April 12. The weekday, however, was Wednesday.

It records a gift of twelve *gayanas* to be collected annually from the contact amount (*keni)* for maintaining a charitable pigotta at Nagarabavi by Kesava, son of Vishnubhatta and Adakeyara Kesavadeva with the permission of the One-Thousand.

**MEVUNDI, MUNDARGI TALUK, DHARWAR DISTRICT**

This is dated the 5^(th) regnal year of the king, Nala, Vaisakha su. 3, Uttarayana sankranti, corresponding to 1196 A.D., April 3, when the weekday was Wednesday. The reference to Sankranti, is evidently an error.

It registers a gift of land to the god Billesvara of Dehutageri by the king and the *Nakharas, Mummuridandas, Mahajanas* and others of the nine towns. Furthers gifts to the deity are mentioned.
