But the inscription without mentioning his name states that the feudatory chief *mahamandalesvara* Guvaladeva of the Goa Kadamba family was governing the provinces of Kokana Nine-hundred, Palasige Twelve-thousand, Kundur Five-hundred, Kadaravalli Thirty, Kavadi-dvipa One lakh and a quarter and other areas. The Kadamba *prasasti* is recounted.

It registers a gift of land made after purchase by Narasinga-setti in favour of the Biliya-basadi which was constructed at the *rajadhani* Analpura by *Pradhana,* Machanna. It mentions the Jaina preceptors Ramachandra and Balachandra. The epigraph is worn out in certain places.

The details of date preserved in this damaged and worn-out record are Saka 105\[8\] and Uttarayana-samkranti corresponding to 1136 A.D. December 25.

In the earlier portion of the epigraph, which appears to have contained a reference to the rule of a Chalukya suzerain, mention is made of a gift by Padmaladevi. Subsequently it seems to record a gift made either by the Kadamba chief Jayakesin II and his queen Mailala-devi or by some one at their instance. There is rference to *rajadhani* Bhogu\[ru\].

This is dated the 17^(th) regnal year of the king, Suka, Pushya-punname, Sunday, lunar eclipse. The date is irregular. In the year Sukla falling in the reign period of the king, the said *tithi* would correspond to 1149 A.D., December 16 which was Friday. Lunar eclipse did not occur on this day. This date would show that his first regnal year was counted from 1133 A.D., falling within the reign period of his father.

It registers a gift of land and two houses made in favour of the god Mallikarjuna and two *maths* by Mada Boppana.
