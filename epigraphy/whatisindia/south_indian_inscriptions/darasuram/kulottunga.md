This is a Sanskrit inscription in Grantha of the reign of Kulottunga-Choladeva (III) who is stated to have won victories over the kings of Simhala and Kerala and over Vira-Pandya after destroying his capital city Madura, and to have performed the anointment of heroes. He is also eulogized for his strength of arms and for his proficiency in arts. The record states that he built (renovated ?) the mandapa for God Sabhapati, the gopura over the shrines of Sripati (Vishnu) and of Girija (Parvati), the Prakara and the golden hall (at Chidambaram ?); the temple for Ekamresvara (at Kanchipuram); for Halasya (at Madurai); for Madhyarjuna (at Tiruvidaimarudur); for Rajarajesvara (at Darasuram ?) ; for Valmikesvara (at Tiruvarur) for whom he also constructed a golden hall and a gopura ; and finally for Tribhuvanaviresvara (at Tribhuvanam) for whom he built this temple of great beauty with several shrines and tall vimanas. He got the god and goddess consecrated in the temple by his guru Somesvara (also called Isvara-Siva) son of Srikantha-Sambhu. This teacher Somesvara was a great scholar well-versed in the eighteen Vidyas (Saiva-darsanas) and capable of expounding the glory of Siva a s taught in the Upanishads. He is said to have written a work called the Siddhantaratnakara. He is surnamed by Mr. Venkayya to be identical with Isanasiva the author of Siddhantasara (An. Rept. 1908, Part II, para 64).
