This is a similar gift made again in the 3^(rd) year of Parthivendra Adityavarman who took the head of Vira-Pandya, to the temples of Tiruvayppadi and Tiruvunniyur in uttarameru-chaturvedimangalam. The usual *purvacharam* was given by Sandiran Elunurruvan *alias* Nulamba Mayilatti. The name of the king Parthivendra-Adityavarman, while it undoubtedly refes to Parthivendravarman, may establish the kingâ€™s possible connexion with the Chola Adityavarman (*i.e.,* Aditya II.)

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! In the3rd year (*of the reign*) of Parthivendra Adityavarman, who took the head of Vira-Pandya, (*this is*) the writing of us (*the members*) of the great assembly of Uttarameru-chaturvedimangalam, (*a village*) in its own subdivision in Kaliyur-kottam.

From those who violate this and show (*these lands*) as taxable, the temple servants (*devaradiyar*) shall themselves collect a fine of twenty-five *kalanju* of gold to be credited to the court of justice whenever demanded.

(L. 8.) Those who oppose this charity shall incur the sins of those who have committed (*sins*) between Ganga (*the Ganges*) and Kumari (Cape Comorin). We (*the members*) of the great assembly have (*thus*) settled this grant. I *madhyasthan* Sivadasan Ayirattennurruva[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_158_161_parthivendravarman.html#_ftn4) Brahmapriyan, wrote (*this*) under the orders of the assembly.

**No. 159.â€” ON THE NORTH WALL OF THE VAIKUNTHA-PERUMAL TEMPLE AT UTTARAMALLUR**[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_158_161_parthivendravarman.html#_ftn5)

In the 3^(rd) year of Parthivendradivarman, who took the head of Vira Pandya, the assembly of Uttarameru-chaturvedimangalam declared certain lands of the goddess Durga-Bhattaraki of that village to be tax-free, on receiving as *purvacharam* the interest which accrued to that temple both from the documents held in the name of the goddess and from those held in the name of the assembly of Damodarachcheri as, perhaps, its trustee.

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! (*In*) the 3^(rd) year (*of the reign*) of Parthivendradivarman who took the head of Vira-Pandya, (*this is*) the writing of us (*the members*) of the great assembly of Uttarameru-chaturvedimangalam, (a village of its own subdivision (*kuru*), in Kaliyur-kottam.

(L. 2.) The *(following*) lands were given to Durga-Bhattaraki of our village for thesacred current expenses, perpetual lamp, *archchanabhoga* and *sribali*.

(L. 3.) 480 *Kuli* of first rate (*land*) on the north side of the third square (*sadukkam*), east of (*the path called*) Pallavanarana-vadi in theseventh *kannaru*, south of Sridevi-vaykkal; 480 *kuli* of first rate (*land*) on the west side of the third square (*sadukkam*) east of (*the path called*) Marapidugu-vadi of the ninth *kannaru* in the same place ; 400 *kuli* on the east side of the first square (sadukkam) west of (*the path called*) Videlvdugu-vadi of the sixteenth *kannaru,* north of (*the lane called*) Subrahmanya-narasam ; 225 *kuli* on thewest side of the norther half (*dugam ?*) of the fourth square (*sadukkam*) west of (*the path called*) Paramesvara-vadi of the seventh *kannaru*, south of the village. We (*the members*) of this Bhattaraki from documents (*kai-eluttu* ?) with Her and the documents with (*the members of*) the assembly of damodarachcheri, made the (*above*) 1,585 *kuli* in the aggregate, tax-free ordering (*their*) exemption from all kinds of taxes.

(L. 7.) I, *madhyasthan* Viranarayana Brahmapriyan wrote this grant by order (*of the assembly*).

**No. 160. â€“ ON THE SAME WALL**[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_158_161_parthivendravarman.html#_ftn6)

This again is a transaction made by the big assembly of Uttaramerur-chaturvedimangalam made in the 3^(rd) year of Parthivedradivarman who took the head of Vira-Pandya. It consisted in making tax-free certain lands of the temple of Kurukshetradeva, on receiving *purvacharam* from Sandiran Elunurruvan *alias* Nulamba-Mayilatti, residing in Kandapurattupettai. This individual is known from No. 24 of 1898 printed below to have been a merchant of Ranavirappadi in Conjeeveram. It is doubtful therefore, if Kandapurattupettai was not another name of Ranavirappadi.
Kurukshetradeva is not a familiar name in Hindu theology but might refer to Krishna who played the chief part in the great war of Kurukshetra and was the author of the famous *Bhagavadgita*.

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 3^(rd) year (*of the reign*) of Parthivendradivarman, who took the head of the Pandya (*king*), (*this is*) the writing of us (*The members*) of the great assembly of Uttaramerur-chaturvedimangalam : â€” (*The following are*) the lands given tax-free as long as the moon and the sun (*last*), to the glorious Kurukshetradeva of our village (*in order that they may*) suitably be applied[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_158_161_parthivendravarman.html#_ftn7) for causing one *tirukkanamadai[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_158_161_parthivendravarman.html#_ftn8)*  
to be cooked (and offered to the god) every day.
