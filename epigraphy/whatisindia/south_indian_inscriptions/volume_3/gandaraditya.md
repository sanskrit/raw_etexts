No. 111 to 112 Adimulesvara temple at Tiruppalatturai

[*No. 113 to 115 Ghritasthanesvara, Dandisvara & Adhipurisvara temples*](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_113_115_gandaraditya.html)

[*No. 116 to 118 Dandisvara at Velachcheri, Vishnu temple at Tirumalpuram*](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_116_118_gandaraditya.html)

**No. 111.â€” ON THE NORTH WALL OF THECENTRAL SHRINE IN THE ADIMULESVARA TEMPLE AT TIRUPPALATTURAI**[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/gandaraditya.html#_ftn1)

This inscription is dated in the 8^(th) year of Rajakesarivarman and registers a grant of land to the Siva temple at Tiruppanambudur which was a hamlet of Uttamasili-chaturvedimangalam, by Tappiladaram Pallavaraiyan *alias* Kilmandur Paruvur, a *perundaram* of prince (*pillaiyar*) Arikulakesarideva. The land granted was made tax-free by the village assembly.

The inscription is engraved on the walls of the stone temple at Tiruppatturai, *i.e.,* the modern Tiruppalatturai which is quite close to Uttamasili, â€” the Uttamasili-chaturvedimangalam of the inscription, evidently so called after prince Uttamasili, a probable son of Parantaka I., not mentioned in the Tiruvalangadu plates. Of the two names Virasrikamugavadi and Arinjigaivaykkal mentioned among the boundaries of the land granted, the latter was probably named after prince Arikulakesarideva.

Arikulakesarideva is identical with the Arikulakesarin of the Tirukkoyilur record of Parakesarivarman Parantaka I.[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/gandaraditya.html#_ftn2)
Professor Kielhorn thinks that this Arikulakesarin is the same as Arinjaya, one of the sons of Parantaka I., mentioned in the large Leyden grant.[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/gandaraditya.html#_ftn3) If this is correct, the king Rajakesarivarman of our inscription who was ruling at that time must evidently be Rajakesarivarman Gandaraditya.[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/gandaraditya.html#_ftn4)

*Perundaram* or *Perundanam* is already known as a title of high rank from the Tanjore inscriptions.

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 8^(th) year of (*the reign of*) king Rajakesarivarman, Tappildaram Pallavaraiyan *alias* Kilmandur Paruvur (*one*) of the *Perundarm* of prince (*pillaiyar)* Arikulakesarideva, gave (*the following*) land as a gift for the maintenance of thesacred central shrine (*tiruvunnaligaipuram*) for sacred offerings to the (*god*) Paramesvara (*Siva*) of Tiruppanambudur
(*hamlet*) of the prosperous Uttamasili-chaturvedimangalam, a *brahmadeya* on the southern bank[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/gandaraditya.html#_ftn5) ; (*viz*.,) â€“

(L. 3.) The land (*consisting*) of 2 *ma* excluding *manilai[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/gandaraditya.html#_ftn6)* and Â½ *ma* of *mannilai*, (*both*) purchased by me from Vengai Ilaiya-Rudrakumara-Kramavittan and (*situated*) to the west of the (*path called*) Virasrikamugavadi and to the south of (*the channel called*) Arinjigaivaykkal and (*which is the*) *utkurai[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/gandaraditya.html#_ftn7)* of this village; one *ma* (*of land given*) by Kumara â€“ Kramavittan of this village to be enjoyed along with above as (*a gift*) for sacred offerings and for (*the maintenance of*) worshippers (*archanabhoga*) of the (*god*) Paramesvara (*Siva*) of Tiruppanambudur; and Â½ *ma* which I purchased from the wife of Narayanan Dasapuriyan of Kuttur and gave out of the 2 *ma* (of land situated) to the east of this *vadi* (*and formed*) the *fifth padagam* of the *sadukkam* owned by Sannamandai-Kramavittan and others of Dvedaigomapuram[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/gandaraditya.html#_ftn8).
Thus (*were given*) these 4 ma of cultivable land (*sey*).

(L. 7.) (*the gift of*) these 4 *ma* of cultivable land was given by both of us as long as the moon and the sun (*endure*) to the (*god*) Paramesvara (*Siva*) of Tiruppanambudur, after having (*the gift*) engraved on stone in the sacred stone temple of Tiruppatturai.

(L. 8.) We, (*the members*) of the big assembly, made this land tax-free as long as the moon and the sun (*endure*). We, (*the members*) of the big assembly, declared that (*the assembly of*) Mahesvaras could themselves decide upon and collect any (*fine*) they choose for (*i.e., on behalf of)* the king from *(such of us)* as might order the levying of taxes on this land or those as were present in the assembly on the occasion or those as might enter the taxes (*in the books*). (*The assembly of*) all *Mahesvaras* shall protect this (*charity*).

**No. 112.â€” ON THE NORTH WALL OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE IN THE ADIMULESVARA TEMPLE AT TIRUPPALATTURAI**[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/gandaraditya.html#_ftn9)

This is again a record of Rajakesarivarman dated in his 8^(th) year and is in some respects similar to the preceding number. It records that the assembly of Uttamasili-chaturvedimangalam, having received ten *kasu* as tax-money from Tappildaram Pallavaraiyan *alias* Kilmandur Paruvur, the donor of No. 111 and a *perundaram* of *alvar* Arikulakesarideva, made the land one *ma* and odd, granted by him to the Siva temple at Tiruppanambudur, tax-free for all time to come. Like the previous inscription, this record also authorizes the imposition of a fine on the members and the accountants of the assembly who might suggest the levying of a tax on the land. The epithet *alvar* which is applied to Arikulakesarideva in this inscription is perhaps a term of respect, as *pillaiyar* in the previous inscription was one of endearment.

Of the names mentioned in the description of the boundaries, the pathway called Kodandaramavadi may have been so named after Kodandarama Rajaditya, the eldest son of king Parantaka I or the latterâ€™s father Aditya I.

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 8^(th) year of (*the reign of*) king Rajakesarivarman, we, (*the members of*) the big assembly of the prosperous Uttamasili-chaturvedimangalam, a *brahmadeya* on the southern bank (*of the Kaveri*)[\[10\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/gandaraditya.html#_ftn10), having received in this year as *iraikaval* ten *kasu* from Tappildaram Pallavaraiyan *alias* Kilmandur Paruvur of the *perundaram* of *alvar*
Arikulakesarideva, on account of the land of the (*god*) Paramesvara (*Siva*) of Tiruppanambudur, which was the *utkurai* of this village, â€” the land (*measuring*) one *ma* and odd including excess or deficiency (*line measurement*) and situated within (*the*) following (*boundaries*) ; â€” to the south of (*the channel called*) Sridevivaykkal (*which was*) to the west of (*the path called*) Virasrikamugavadi; to the north of (*the channel called*) Paantakavaykkal (*which irrigates*) the first *sadiram* from the north, of the fifth *kannaru[\[11\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/gandaraditya.html#_ftn11)* (*counting*) from the east; to the east of (*the path* *called*) Kodandaramavadi and to the west of the *kannaru* to the south of the tenth *padagam* in the *sadukkam* belonged to Nottur Attona-chaturvedibhattan and others.

(L. 11.) (*We*) exempted this one *ma* and odd of land from payment of taxes and ordered that this land be (*registered*) tax-free as long as the moon and the sun (*endure*) ; and we, (*the members*) of the big assembly had this (*deed*) engraved on stone : â€” (*also ordered that the assembly of*) all *Mahesvaras* could themselves collect for (*i.e., on behalf of*) the king mentioned above[\[12\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/gandaraditya.html#_ftn12) any (*fine in*) gold they choose from (*such of us*) as may order the levying of taxes on this land or those who may enter (*any*) tax (*in the accounts*). (*The assembly of*) all *Mahesvaras* shall protect this (*charity*).

The meaning of this word is not apparent. It must indicate a particular class of land.

The revenue term *utkurai* is composed of *ul* and *kurai* which signifies the deduction of the lands in question from within the village  
. Perhaps the *utkurai-lands* were not subject to any assessment.
