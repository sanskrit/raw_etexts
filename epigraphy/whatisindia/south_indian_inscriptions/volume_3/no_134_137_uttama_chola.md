This inscription which is dated in the 9^(th) year of king Parakesarivarman Uttama-Choladeva registers provision for food-offering made by the officer Villavan Muvendavelan of Puduvur in Tirunaraiyr-nadu, to the temple of Mahadeva (*Siva*) of the sacred Virattana at Tirukkandiyur.

**No. 135.- ON THE SOUTH WALL OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE IN THE UJJIVANATHASVAMIN TEMPLE AT UYYAKKONDAN-TIRUMALAI**[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_134_137_uttama_chola.html#_ftn2)

This fragmentary inscription is dated in the 10^(th) year of Uttama-Chola. Thirunallur is identical with Nallur, a village 5 miles south of Mumbhakonam. Manakkurai Viranaraynanar was evidently an officer of the king deputed to check the accounts of the temple of Tirunallur.

Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 10^(th) year of (the reign of) the glorious Uttama-Chola and during the inspection of the temple management (srikaryam) by Manakkurai Viranarayananar under the orde of the king (the following lands) were given to Mahadeva (Siva) (of the temple) at Tirunallur, after due scrutiny of the temple business.

**No. 137.- ON THE WEST WALL OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE IN THE NAGESVARASVAMIN TEMPLE AT KUMBAKONAM**[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_134_137_uttama_chola.html#_ftn4)

The importance of the subjoined inscription consists in the astronomical details of date it supplies and the name Viranarayaniyar which it gives as that of the queen of king Uttama-Chola. The record apparently registers a grant of land to the temple of Tirukkil-kottam (the present Nagesvara) at Tirukkudamukkil (*i.e.,* Kumbhakonam).

The astronomical details of the date have been verified by Diwan Bahadur L. D. Swamikkannu Pillai and found correct for the 13^(th) year of the reign of Parakesarivarman Uttama-Chola. The given date corresponds to Friday 9^(th) June A.D. 982.[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_134_137_uttama_chola.html#_ftn5)
