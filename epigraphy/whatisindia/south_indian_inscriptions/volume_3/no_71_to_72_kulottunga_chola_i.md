**No. 71.- Inscription at Kilappaluvur.**

This inscription (No. 105 of 1895) is engraved on the west wall of the second *prakara* of the Vatamulesvara temple at Kilappaluvur in the Udaiyarpalaiyam taluka of the Trichinopoly district.[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_71_to_72_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn1)
This village is mentioned under the name of Paluvur in Tirunanasambandarâ€™s *Devaram*. The subjoined inscription calls it both Sirupaluvur (II. 18, 23, 25) and simply Paluvur (II. 26, 27). It belonged to Kunra-kurram, a subdivision of the district of Uttongatonga-valanadu (1. 18). According to their inscriptions at Kilappaluvur, the name of the Siva temple was Tiruvalandurai-Mahadeva, in which *al*, â€˜the banyan,â€™ is the Tamil equivalent of *vata*, the first member of Vatamulesvara, the Sanskrit designation of the temple.
A Vishnu temple at the same village, which was named Vira-Sola-Vinnagar, is mentioned in line 28 of the subjoined inscription.

The date is the 20^(th) year of the reign of Kulottunga I., when the assembly of Sirupaluvur sold one twentieth *veli* of land for one *kasu* to the mother of a certain Virudarajabhayamkara-Vanakovaraiyar. This may have been the chief of Vanakoppadi, a district which is mentioned in an inscription at Tirukkovalur (No. 126 of 1900). That he received his title from Kulottunga I., follows from the first portion of this name, Virudarajabhayamkara, which, according to the *Kalingattu-Parani* (x. verse 25), was a surname of Kulottunga I. Another derivative of the same surname is the district of Virudaraja-bhayamkara-valanadu ; Gangaikondacholapuram and Tirumudukunram (*i.e.,* Vriddhachalam in the South Arcot district) belonged to Merka-nadu, a subdivision of this district.[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_71_to_72_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn2)
A Telugu inscription of Kulottunga I. mentions Manni-nandu as another sub-division of the same district.[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_71_to_72_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn3)

(Line 17.) In the twentieth year (*of the reign*) of king Rajakesarivarman, *alias* the emperor of the three worlds, Sri-Kulottunga-Soladeva, who *etc.,[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_71_to_72_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn4)* - we, the assembly of Sirupaluvur, a *brahmadeya* in Kunra-kurram, (*a subdivision*) of Uttongatonga-valanadu, sold the following land at a price (*settled by*) the assembly to Solakulasundaran-Vichchadiri Alvar, the mother of Vi\[ru\]darajabhayamkara-Vanako\[va\]raiyar.

(L. 19.) One fortieth (*veli*) of land on the eastern side of the one twentieth (*veli*) of land on the northern side of the four twentieths (*veli*) of land of the second square of the first *kannaru[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_71_to_72_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn5)* to the north of the *Rajendra-Sola* channel (*and*) to the east of the *Pavilli\[ram\]anikka* road.

((L. 20.) And one fortieth (*veli*) of land on the western side of the one twentieth (*veli*) of land on the northern side of the four twentieths (*veli*) of land (*of*) the second square of the second *kannaru* to the east of this road (*and*) to the north of this channel.

(L. 21.) Altogether, one twentieth (*veli*) of land. The price which we have to receive from her for this one twentieth (*veli*) of land, (*and*) on which we have agreed, (*is*) one good *kasu* current at the time.[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_71_to_72_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn6)

(L. 22.) Having received this one *kasu* in full into the hand . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . .. . . . . . . .[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_71_to_72_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn7) we, the assembly of the *brahmadeya* of Sirupaluvur, sold (*the land*) and made and gave a deed of sale. For this one twentieth (*veli*) of land this alone shall be the record of sale, and this alone shall be the record of the final payment of the money,[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_71_to_72_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn8) and they (*viz.,* the purchasers) shall not be bound to produce another record of the final payment of the money besides this.

(L. 24.) Having thus agreed, having received this one *kasu*, and having sold this one twentieth (*veli*) of land at the full price, we, the assembly of Sirupaluvur, have received the money in full.

(L. 25.) By their order, I, the *Madhyastha[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_71_to_72_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn9)* Pa\[luvur-U\]daiyan Ayirattirunurruvan Mudikondan, wrote this document (*pramana*) ; this is my writing. I, Palasiriyan \[Ila\]kkuvanan (*Lakshmana*) \[Ku\]ttappan of \[S\]an\[da\]mangalam, (*know*) this ; this is my writing. I, Sa\[v\]andi-Naranan (*i.e.,* Narayana) of Paluvur\[r\], (*know*) this ; this is my writing. This (is the writing) of Sandi Palasiriyan Viranarayanan. This (*is the writing of*) Sa\[va\]udi Narayanan Maran. Thus do I know, Narayanan Tiruva\[yi\]kkulam-Udaiyan,[\[10\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_71_to_72_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn10) who performs the worship of the temple of Vira-Sola-Vinnagar-Alvar in this village. This do I know, the blacksmith of this village. This (*is*) placed under the protection of all *Mahesvaras*.

**No. 72.- Inscription at Tiruvidaimarudur.**

This inscription (No. 132 of 1895) is engraved on the east wall of the second *prakara* of the Mahalingasvamin temple at Tiruvidaimarudur[\[11\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_71_to_72_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn11) in the Kumbhakonam taluka of the Tanjore district. This village is mentioned in Tirunanasambandarâ€™s *Devaram* as Idaimarudu. The Sanskrit equivalent of this name is Madhyarjuna,[\[12\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_71_to_72_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn12) in which *Madhya* corresponds to *idai*, â€˜the middle,â€™ and *arujuna* to *marudu*, â€˜Terminalia alata.â€™ In the subjoined inscription the village is called Tiruvidaimarudil[\[13\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_71_to_72_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn13) and its temple Tiruvidaimarud-Udaiyar (*i.e.,* the lord of Tiruvidaimarudu). It belonged to Tiraimur-nadu, a subdivision of Ulaguyyakkonda-Sola-valanadu.[\[14\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_71_to_72_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn14)
The inscription records a grant of 120 sheep for two lamps. The *Pujaris* of the temple and the inhabitants of Tiruvidaimarudil and Tiraimur were appointed trustees of the grant. Tiraimur I do not find on the map; but, as its inhabitants seem to have had a share in the management of the temple at Tiruvidaimarudur, it was probably not far distant from the latter.

The date is the 172^(nd) day of the 26^(th) year of the reign of Kulottunga I. The historical introduction agrees with that of the 20^(th) year (No. 71 above), but adds that the king conquered the Kalinga-mandalam (1. 4.). Other inscriptions refer to a single queen, who is styled â€˜the mistress of the whole world,â€™[\[15\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_71_to_72_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn15) and who is perhaps identical with Madurantaki, the daughter of Rajendradeva.[\[16\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_71_to_72_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn16) In addition to this queen, the subjoined inscription mentions three other queens, *viz.,* Dinachintamani, Elisai-Vallabhi,[\[17\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_71_to_72_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn17) and Tyagavalli. Of the last of these the *Kalingattu-Parani* (x. verse 55) states that â€œshe had the right to issue orders together with the orders of the senni (*i.e.* the Chola king).â€?

(Line 4.)[\[18\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_71_to_72_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn18) (*He*) was pleased to seize the Kalinga-mandalam, whose rivers were checked (*by dams*)s, and was pleased to take his seat (*on the throne*) with the mistress of the whole world who remained (*his*) chief consort, while (*his*) valour and liberality shone like (*his*) necklace acquired in warfare and (*like*) the flower-garland on (*his*) royal shoulders ; while (*all men on*) earth worshipped (*him*) ; while the mistress of the whole world, Dinachintamani, was present, as Uma near Siva ; while the mistress of the seven worlds, Elisai-Valabhi, - may she prosper ! â€“ the ornament of women, was calmly land joyfully seated, as Ganga takes her seat with her (viz. Uma) ; (*and*) while his (i.e., the kingâ€™s favourite) mistress of the world, Tyagavalli, possessing the splendour of Lakshmi who is inseparably clinging to the bosom of Tirumal (*Vishnu*) to the end of the world, was present.
