This inscription registers a gift of 93 sheep for burning a perpetual lamp in the temple of Varahadeva at Tiruvidavandai by a native of Talaisayanapuram *alias* Taiyyur, in the 8^(th) year of king Parthivendradivarman.

Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 8^(th) year of (*the reign of*) king Parthivendradivarman, I, Anikilan of Talaisayanappuram *alias* Taiyur (*situated*) in this (i.e., Amur-)kottam and in its (*own*) subdivision, gave ninety-three sheep which neither die nor grow old for one sacred perpetual lamp set up by Namban Manjan *alias* Ugavaripperaiyan to (*last*) as long as the moon and the sun, in (*the temple of)* the glorious Varahadeva at Tiruvidavandai (*which was*) a *devadana* (*village*) in Paduvur-nadu (*a subdivision*) of Amur-kottam. I, Vilakkan Kandanadan, a shepherd (*manradi)* living in Tiruvidavandai, having received these ninety-three sheep, bind myself to measure out daily (*one*) *ulakku* of ghee. We (*the members*) of the assembly of Tiruvidavandai shall have this sacred perpetual lamp supervised by Kadunganaiyan and shall see that it is maintained. Whoso (*of us*) acts against this charity shall incur the sins committed by sinners (*living*) in the seven hundred *kadam* (*of land*) between Ganga (the ganges) and Kumari (Cape Comorin). The sacred feet of those who protect this charity (*shall*) be on my head.

**No. 186.â€” ON THE SAME BASE**[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_185_189_parthivendravarman.html#_ftn2)

Two residents of Talaisayanapuram *alias* Taiyur made a present of fifteen *kalanju* of gold to the image of Manavalapperumal which they had caused to be cast, for the temple of Varahasvamin at Tiruvidavandai (the modern Tiruvadandai). The assembly of the village received the money in the 8^(th) year of king Rajamarayar and agreed to pay an annual interest of 56 *kadi* of paddy on that amount.

Rajamarayar who took the head of Vira-Pandya could be no other than Parthivendravarman. No. 152 above, from Uttaramallur, calls the same king Partma-Maharaja who took the head of Vira-Pandya.

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! IN the 8^(th) year (*of the reign*) of king Rajamarayar who took the head of Vira-Pandya, (*this is*) the writing of us (*the members*) of the assembly and the residents of Tiruvidavandai, a devadana in Paduvurnadu, (*a subdivision*) of Amur-kottam.

(L. 2.) The two (*individuals*) Vaiyyodu-kilan Vaikundadigal and his younger brother Tali Eruman of Talaisayanapura *alias* Taiyyur gave . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .of gold, to the image of Manavalapperumal which both of them had caused to be cast[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_185_189_parthivendravarman.html#_ftn3) for (*the temple of*) the glorious Varahasvamin at Tiruvidavandai. We (*the assembly and the residents*) have received this fifteen *kalanju* of gold; and in payment of interest on this gold, we agree to measure out by the eight-*nali* measure (*kal*) in the months of Panguni and Sittirai, fifty-six *kadi* of well-winnowed *kuttai*-paddy free from moisture and chaff, in accordance (*with the stipulation*) that this (*quantity*) of paddy is to be measured every year as long as the moon and the sun (*last*), at (*the rate of*) five *nali* every day. For each year of default we admit (*the default* ?) and agree to measure out the fifty-six *kadi* of *kuttai*-paddy (*of that year*) (*one some future occasion*).

(L. 7.) If this be violated (*we*) agree to pay as fine one-eighth *pon* daily, to the king demanding it, for being credited to the court of justice. (*Even*) after paying the fine this paddy shall be measured out without failure. Those who raise (*any*) objection to this shall incur[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_185_189_parthivendravarman.html#_ftn4) the sins committed by the sinner between Ganga and Kumari. May the sacred feet of those who protect this charity rest on my head. We, the two divisions (*viz.,)* the assembly (*sabhaiyom*) and the residents (*urom*) of Tiruvidavandai mentioned above gave this grant with our united consent.

**No. 187.â€” ON A STONE AT ANAIKKATTATTUR**[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_185_189_parthivendravarman.html#_ftn5)

In the 9^(th) year of king Parthivendravarman, the residents (*urom*) ofAnai-Akkaraippudur made tax-free certain lands which had been already dedicated to the *srikoyil* of Adityadeva in that village, which was owned by Vaikhanasan Kalinikki-bhatta.

We have here the residents (*urom*) taking the place of *sabhaiyom* of other inscriptions. A technical distinction was perhaps made between these two bodies.[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_185_189_parthivendravarman.html#_ftn6)

Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 9^(th) year (*of the reign*) of king Parthivendravarman, we the residents (*urom*) of Anai-Akkaraippudur made tax-free the four *tadi* of land and the well without excluding (*any*) in-lying land (*and*) gave (*as*) *archchanabhoga* to this Adityadeva, as long as the moon and the sun (*exist*), in the village-site (*nattam*) of Pulidikkalnettur which had been (*already*) given as *archchanabhoga* to (*the temple of*) Adityadeva of (i.e., worshipped by) Vaikhanasan Kalinikkibhatta of our village, by Serupposan Eluvan, (*his*) brothers and (*his*) junior uncle. We gave (*further*) as *archchanabhoga* to this god (*the fields*) *Devakuttai* and *Unangarppidi* in the cultivable land of our village and a house south of this sacred temple (*srikoyil*). (*To*) Kalinikki-bhatta who worships this god. . . . . . . . .
