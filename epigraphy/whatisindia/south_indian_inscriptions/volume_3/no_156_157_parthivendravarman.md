This record refers to a number of committees which comprised the great assembly of Kaviripakkam *alias* Amaninarayana-chaturvedimangalam.
These were *samvatsara-variyam, totta-variyam, eri-variyam, kalani-variyam, panchavara-variyam, kanakku-variyam, kalingu-variyam* and *tadivali-variyam.* Besides these, the assembly included a general body of bhattas *(learned Brahmanas)* of the village, the *â€˜rulerâ€™* (i.e., *the headman*) of the village and the overseer. Perhaps the two last-mentioned personages were the representatives of Government in the village assembly. An elaborate description of the formation of the village assemblies during the time of Parantaka I. is given in the two Uttaramallur inscriptions published by Rai Bhadur V. Venkayya in the *Archaeological Survey Report* for 1904-05.

In the 3^(rd) year of king Parthivendradivarman, the village assembly received a petition from one of the trustees of the temple stating that a garden and a field which were the *archanabhoga* of the god of Tirukkarapuram had been lying waste, being silted up by sand by the breaches in the river. The assembly directed the *kalni-variyam* committee to grant 1,400 *kuli* of land from the village *manjikkam* which was lying untaxed. The term *manjikkam* perhaps corresponds to the present *poramboke* and the right vested in the village assemblies to dispose of such land deserves to be specially noted.

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity! In the 3^(rd) year and the 39^(th) day (*of the reign*) of king Parthivendradivarman, the great assembly of Kaviripakkam *alias* Amaninarayana-chaturvedimangalam, (*a village*) in Paduvur-kottam, consisting of the great men of the annual-supervision committee (*samvatsarvariyam*) for this year, the great men of the garden-supervision committee (*totta-variyam*), the great men to the tank-supervision committee (*eri-variyam*), the great men of the wet fields-supervision committee (*kalani-variyam*), the great men of (*the suburb* ?) Vada â€“Viranarayana ; the great men of the *pancha-vara* committee (*panchavara-variyam*), the great men of the accounts-supervision committee (*kanakku-variyam*), the great men of the sluice-supervision committee (*kalingu-variyam*), the great men of the fields-supervision committee (*tadivali-variyam*), the bhattas, visishtas and others of the big assembly together with Pallavan Brahmadarayan, the ruler of the villager and the overseer Arumbakilan, having met together in the *abhisheka-mandapa* of the big temple of this village.

(L. 4.) Mangandanan, a Siva-Brahmana of this temple (*sthana*), petitioned that the garden and the field which were the *archchanabhoga* of the god, the lord of Tirukkarapura, were lying waste, being silted up with sand by breaches in the river. The members of the assembly directed that thegreat men of the wet field-supervision committee (*holding office*) this year shall themselves (*grant*) this one thousand four hundred *kuli* (*of land*) (*measured*) by the wet field-measure (*kalani-kol*) out of the *manjikkam* land of the village, (*in lieu of*) the land which is the *archchanabhoga* of the lord of this Tirukarapura and is lying waste being silted up, shall set up stones (*for boundaries*) and have (*the order*) engraved on stone. In pursuance of the order (*tirumugam*) which the assembly was (*thus*) pleased to make, we the great men of the wet field-supervision committee gave the (*following*) land as *archchanabhoga* to the lord of Tirukkarapura : -

(L. 7.) Four hundred *kuli* of land, (*measured*) by the wet field-measuring rod, comprised within the (*following*) four boundaries : â€” the eastern boundary of (*this*) land, which not being taxed, lies as the *manjikkam* of the village to the south of the (*channel*) Mahadavaykal in the northern fields of Ochcheri, a hamlet of this village, (*is*) to the west of the land of Somasi of Mangadu ; the southern boundary (*is*) to the north of the high ground which has been lying as village *manjikkam* ; the western boundary (*is*) to the east of (the land called) Udamadampatti of the lord of Trumulattanam in (*the temple of*) Tirupanrisvaram and the northern boundary (*is*) to the south of the (*channel called*) Mahada-vaykal.

(L. 9.) Four hundred *kuli* south of this, (*measured*) by the wet field-measuring rod, â€” a village *manjikkam* land not taxed and (*situated*) on the north side of (*the channel called*) Tirunarana-vaykal in the wet-field of the high ground (*called*) Sirukarugesuva which was also a village *manjikkam* â€“ and comprised within the (*following*) four boundaries: â€” (*viz*.) the eastern boundary (*which is*) to the west of (*the channel*) Nadaikal which runs closely to the west of the land belonging to Angarai Madeva-bhatta; the southern boundary (*which is*) to the north of the Tirunarana-vaykal; the western boundary (*which is*) to the east of the land of Aiyan Peruman and the northern boundary (*which is*) to the south (?)[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_156_157_parthivendravarman.html#_ftn2) of the land of Mudumbai-Porkuli.

(L. 11.) Again, six hundred *kuli* on the south side of this (*Tirunaranavaykal*) channel (*measured*) by the wet field-measuring rod, of (*one*) *ma* of land which was also lying as village *manjikkam* not paying any tax, (*included within*) the (*following*) four boundaries (*viz.,)* : â€” the eastern boundary (*which is*) to the west of the land which paid no taxes; the southern boundary (*which is*) to the north of (*the field called*) Somasibbumi which belonged to Avattaikilavan and to the *kundil* to the east of it ; the western boundary (*which is*) to the east of . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . (*the field called*) Kalayasomasi-bhumi and to the south of the channel (*i.e.,* Tirunarana-vaykal).

(L. 12.) Altogether these one thousand four hundred *kuli* (*of land*) we, the great men of the wet-field-supervision committee (*doing duty*) for this year . . . . . . . . . . . . . members of the assembly, gave as tax-free *archchanabhoga* as long as the moon and the sun (*last*) engraving it on stone and fixing (*boundary*) stones, to the god (*perumanadigal*) of this Tirukarapura for (*providing*) daily one sacred meal of two *nali* of rice, for performing worship at the three periods (*of the day*) and (*for*) lighting a lamp.

(L. 13.) This is the signature of me Manimangalam-udaiyan Gangadhara Mayilatti, the accountant of the wet field-supervision committee for this year, who wrote this stone inscription under orders, being (*myself*) one of the assembly (*kuri*). I, the accountant . . . . . . . .and *madhyasthan* Vamana . . . . . . . . . . Elayiravan wrote this under orders being (*myself*) one of the assembly (*kuri*).[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_156_157_parthivendravarman.html#_ftn3)
