This inscription recores that in the 13^(th) year of king Parthivendradhipativarman, his queen Tribhuvana-Mahadeviyar gave 192 sheep for two perpetual lamps to be burnt in the shrine of Vellaimurtti-Perumanadigal in the temple of Kongaraiyar at Uttarameru-chaturvedimangalam. We know from the previous inscription that this Kongaraiyar built at Uttarameru-chaturvedimangalam the Vishnu temple named Sriveli-Vishnugriha.

Hail! Prosperity! In the 13^(th) year of (*the reign of*) king Parthivendradhipativarman, the queen consort Tribhuvana-Mahadeviyar gave for two perpetual lamps to (*the god*) Vellaimurti-Perumanadigal in the *Srikoil* of Kongaraiyar at Uttarameru-chaturvedimangalam, (*a village*) in its (*own*) subdivision in Kaliyur-kottam, 96 sheep which neither die nor grow old placing them in charge of the cultivators (*vellalar*) of the different quarters (*ponmaichcher*i) (*of this village*) on condition that they would themselves protect and maintain (*the lamps*) as long as the moon and the sun (*endure*). (*She again gave*) 96 sheep which neither die nor grow old in charge of the merchants of the middle bazaar (*naduvilangadi*) who also agreed to protect and maintain (the lamps) as long as the moon and the sun (*endure*). These same would (*thus*) protect the sheep (*given on account*) of these two lamps and cause to be measured out daily without fail one *uri* of ghee for (*maintaining*) the perpetual lamps. This gift was placed under the supervision (*kadaikatchi*) (*of these two communities*). If the sheep thus presented are not supervised, the temple servants (devaradiyar) themselves . . . .. . . . . . . . . . of one *manjadi* of gold daily to (*i.e., on behalf of*) the then-reigning king.

**No. 196.â€” ON A SLAB BUILT INTO THE FLOOR OF THE MANDAPA IN FRONT OF THE LATAMADHYAMBA SHRINE IN THE MASILAMANISVARA TEMPLE AT TIRUMULLAIVAYIL**[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_195_198_parthivendravarman.html#_ftn2)

The inscription states that in the 13^(th) year of king Parthivendradivarman, Singala Viranaranan, a native of the Chola country, made a gift of 90 sheep for burning a perpetual lamp in the temple of Mahadeva (*Siva*) at Tirumullaivayil, a *devadana* village in Pular-kottam.

Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 13^(th) year of (*the reign of*) king Parthivendradivarman, Singala Viranaranan of Vilattur, the headman of Vilattur in Avur-kurram, (*a subdivision*) of Sola-nadu, deposited (*to last*) as long as the moon (*exists*) 90 sheep which neither die nor grow old (*to provide*) for one perpetual lamp to be burnt (*in the temple of*) the god Mahadeva (*Siva*) at Tirumullaivayil, a *devadana* in Vellaiyur-nadu, (*a subdivision of*) Pular-kottam. The sacred feet of him that protects this gift shall rest on my head.

**No. 197.â€” ON THE NORTH WALL OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE IN THE MANIKANTHESVARA TEMPLE AT TIRUMALPURAM**[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_195_198_parthivendravarman.html#_ftn3)

This record, which is dated in the 13^(th) year of Parthivendradivarman who took the head of Vira-Pandya, registers a gift of twenty-five *kalanju* of gold marked and weighted by the standard weight (*dharmakattalai-tulai-nirai*) for burning two lamps in the temple of Siva at Tirumalperu. The assembly of Pattalam *alias* Elunurruva-chaturvedimangalam in Damar-nadu accepted the gold andagreed to maintain the two lamps from the interest thereon. It is interesting to note that the lamps were the gift of Vijjavai-Mahadeviyar or Vijjavaiyar who was related to Nandivarman Kadupattigal, perhaps, as his queen. Nandivarman Kadupattigal is clearly a Pallava name ; but we cannot definitely identify the king nor fix his relationship to the ruling sovereign Parthivendradivarman.

Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 13^(th) year of (*the reign of*) king Parthivendradivarman who took the head of Vira-Pandya, (*this is*) the writing of us, (*the members of the*) assembly of Pattalam *alias* Elunurruva-chaturvedimangalam in Damar-nadu, (*a subdivision*) of Damar-kottam. We have received from Vajjavaiyar, daughter of Vallamanar, twenty-five *kalanju* of gold of the standard weight and mark (*dharmakattalai-tulai-nirai)* and for interest on this gold we \[stand surety for\] . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . one of the two sacred lamps (*in the temple*) of Mahadeva (*Siva*) of Tirumalperu of this (*same*) *kottam* . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . one for (*the merit of*) Vijjavai-Mahadeviyar . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Nandipanma Kadupatti\[gal\] We (*the members*) of the assembly of Pattalam *alias* Elunurruva-chaturvedimangalam agree to supply without failure . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . moon . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . oil . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . equal (*in capacity*) to . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . for (*burning*) these two lamps. If (*the supply of*) this oil is stopped (*we*) agree to pay as fine (*manru*) one-eighth *pon* daily at the court of justice . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . agree to pay as fine five *pon* daily and to give two meals daily to the persons in charge of the sacred inner enclosure, for burning the oil. We (*the members*) of the assembly of Pattalam *alias* Elununurruva-chaturvedimangalam had this gift engraved on stone with (our) full consent.

Mannan Kannan alias Kamamoga-Varanapperaraiyan, an elephant mahout of king Parthivendradivarman, purchased in the 13th year of the king some land at Sirriyarru from the temple of Govindapadi and assigned it for feeding a Brahmana in the matha which was evidently attached to that temple.

This charity is placed under the protection of the sri-Vaishnavas.
