**No. 55.- On the west wall of the Bilvanathesvara shrine**

This inscription is dated in the 3^(rd) year of the reign of the Chola king Rajendra (1. 4) and refers to the conquest of Ratta-padi (1. 1), the setting-up of a pillar of victory at Kollapuram (1. 2), and the defeat of Ahavamalla at Koppam (1. 3).[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_55_to_57_tiruvallam.html#_ftn1)
It records that the temple authorities received 25 *kalanju* of gold from an inhabitant of Aimbuni,[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_55_to_57_tiruvallam.html#_ftn2) under the condition that the interest should be applied for the feeding of a learned Brahmana and other purposes. The end of the inscription is lost.

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! While the army of (*his)* elder brother[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_55_to_57_tiruvallam.html#_ftn3) - the king (*who held*) the sceptre (*and*) was embraced by the goddess of fortune â€“ was at (*his*) back, (*he*) conquered the seven and a half *lakshas* of Iratta-padi. When the first elephant (*of the enemy*) went at his elephant, (*his*) elder brother stopped (*it*). (*He*) set up a pillar of victory at Kollapuram and did not meet with opposition in battle, (but his) drums were sounding through the eight directions.
Having heard this (*report*), Ahavamalla proceeded to Koppam on the bank of the great river and fought against (*him*), (*but*) became afraid, incurred disgrace and ran away. (*The king*) seized his elephants and horses, (*his*) women and treasures, together with the camels, and performed the anointment of victory. In the 3^(rd) year (*of the reign*) of (*this*) king Parakesarivarman, *alias* the lord Sri-Rajendradeva, who was graciously seated on the throne of heroes.

**No. 56.- On the south wall of the Mahamandapa in the Bilvanathesvara temple**

This inscription is incomplete. Of the five lines which are preserved I am publishing only the two first ones. It is dated in the 2^(nd) year of the reign of Rajakesarivarman, *alias* Rajamahendradeva, and records that a military officer purchased 800 *kuli* (1.4) of land from the inhabitants of Tiruvallam and granted them to the temple.

On page 32 above it has been stated that the *Kalingattu-Parani* and *Vikkirama-Solan-Ula* mention two Chola kings who have not yet been identified. The first of them reigned between Rajendra and Virarajendra I., and the second between Virarajendra I. and Kulottunga-Chola I. In the introductory remarks to No. 57 it will be shown that the second king is identical with Parakesarivarman, *alias* Adhirajendradeva. Hence the only king who remains to be identified is the successor of Rajendra and predecessor of Virarajendra I. he may be identified provisionally with Rajakesarivarman, *alias* Rajamahendradeva, to whose 2^(nd) year the subjoined inscription belongs. In favour of this identification it may be mentioned that the subjoined inscription praises him for guiding the goddess of the earth on the path of Manu, while the *Kalingattu-Parani* (vii. 28) speaks of â€œthe Chola who dispensed justice three or four times better than the ancient Manu,â€?[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_55_to_57_tiruvallam.html#_ftn8) and that an inscription of the 9^(th) year of Rajendra mentions among the boundaries of a village â€œthe road of Rajamahendra.â€?[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_55_to_57_tiruvallam.html#_ftn9)
Perhaps Rajamahendra was the co-regent of Rajendra.

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 2^(nd) year (*of the reign*) of king Rajakesarivarman, *alias* the lord Sri-Rajamahendradeva, who, while the goddess of fortune was resplendent, wedded the great goddess of the earth, in order that (*she*) might abide joyfully under the shade of a single parasol, and who caused (*her*) to walk (*in*) the path of Manu, in order that (*she*) might abide (*in*) the way of righteousness. The hand-writing, (*referring to*) a deed of sale of land, of us, the assembly of Tiruvallam in Karaivali, (*a subdivision*) of Perumbanappadi, (*a district*) of Jayankonda-Sola-mandalam. We have received sixty-four *kasu*, (*which were*) good (*i.e.,* of full weight) (*and*) current at the time, from Samkaran Kandaradittanar, *alias* the *Senapati* Rajaraja-Soliyavaraiyar, the lord of Inga\[nur\] in Inganadu, (a district) of Arumolideva-valanadu. At the rate of seven *manadi* of pure gold, weighted by the true standard of the city,[\[10\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_55_to_57_tiruvallam.html#_ftn10) for each *kasu*, (*this amount*) is equal to twenty-two *kalanju* and eight *manadi* of gold. Having received these twenty-two *kalanju* and eight *manjadi* of gold from Chandesvaradeva, the first servant of (*the god*) Mahadeva (*of the* *temple*) of Tiruvallam in our city, we sold (*the following*) land.

(L. 2.) (*The field called*) *Kodachcheruvu* below the large tank of Rajendra-Chola. The eastern boundary of (*this field is*) & c.

**No. 57.- On the north wall of the Mahamandapa in the Bilvanathesvara temple**

This inscription is dated on the 200^(th) day of the 3^(rd) year of the reign of Parakesarivarman, *alias* A\[dhi\]rajendradeva (1. 4 f.). Two royal officers met at Kanchipuram (1. 7) and called for the accounts of the villages which belonged to the Tiruvallam temple. One of the two decided that the revenue from the villages of Kukkanur[\[11\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_55_to_57_tiruvallam.html#_ftn11) in Tuy-nadu (1. 12) and Mandiram[\[12\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_55_to_57_tiruvallam.html#_ftn12) in the same *nadu* (1. 13) should be assigned to the temple for expenses not previously provided for. A larger committee then assembled and made allotments from this revenue for various heads of the temple expenditure.
