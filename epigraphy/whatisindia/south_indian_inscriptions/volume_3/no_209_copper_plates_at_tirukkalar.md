**No. 209.â€” Tirukkalar plate of KulotTunga-Chola**

This inscription in 19 lines is engraved on the third plate of the Tirukkalar set. It is dated in the twenty-eighth year of the reign of Tribhuvanachakravartin Kulottunga-Choladeva without any distinguishing epithet or historical introduction. In the absence of these, through it is not generally possible to say to which of the three kings who bore that name this record must be attributed, yet it appears to be a record of Kulottunga-Chola I, since it is stated in the fourth inscription in this set in referring to this record that the king abolished tolls â€”
which is generally a feat attributed to Kulottunga I. It registers a gift of paddy made by a certain Sivan Tillainayakan *alias* Siruttondanambi of Tannirkunram in Nenmali-nadu to the temple of Mahadeva at Tirukkalar in Purangarambai-nadu which was a sub-division of Rajendrasola-valanadu for the purpose of taking in procession Aravabharanadeva, for offerings to Pillaiyar and the god in the Mulattanam and for feeding devotees on the days of the new-moon.

Tannirkunram, to which the donor belonged, is a village 7 miles to the east of Mannargudi in the Tanjore District. The modern village of Nemmeli in the same Taluk, must have been the principal place in the division Nenmali-nadu in which Tannirkunram is said to have been situated.

**Translation**

**No. 210.-Tirukkalar plate of Tirubhuvanachakravartin Rajarajadeva**

This is the fourth inscription in the Tirukkalar set. It is engraved on the second side of the third plate and belongs to the 18^(th) year of the reign of Tribhuvanachakravartin rajarajadeva. It records that some of the families of the donees, who received the gift made by Sivan Tillainayagan of Tannirkunram in the twenty-eighth year of the reign of Kulottunga-Chola, the abolisher of tolls, ceased to have male members and that in consequence a question arising as to how the feeding pertaining to these families should be conducted in future, the Mahesvaras settled that the feeding stipulated in the grant to be done by the donees devolved on the female descendants as well and that arrangements were made in accordance with that order. The inscription may probably belong to the reign of Rajaraja II, though the distinguishing epithet of the king is missing and the characters appear to belong to a later period.

**Translation**

Hail ! Prosperity ! In the eighteenth year and one hundred and eightieth day of (*the reign of*) the emperor of the three worlds the glorious Rajarajadeva, when male descendants ceased to exist in some of the families of the *andar* who had been living in the *tirumadai-vilagam* of the god and who had obtained a paddy-gift for conducting the feeding specified in a copper-plate grant engraved formerly (*i.e.,*) in the twenty-eighth year of (*the reign of*) Kulottunga-Choladeva, the abolisher of tolls, from Sivan Tillainayagan of Tannirkunram, who made provision for the new-moon festival and for feeding the devotees (*devaradiyar*) of the god Mahadeva who had sprung at Tirukkalar in Purangarambai-nadu, (*a subdivision)* of Rajendrasola-valanadu and who (i.e., the *andar*) had been conducting the feeding with the gifts and when Kanakarayar and the Mahesvaras wished to decide how the feeding pertaining to the families having only female descendants should be conducted, the Mahesvaras came to the settlement that the feeding from the interest (*of a gift*) devolved also on the female descendants. It was so agreed and that in accordance with the agreement made by the female descendants, (*it was decided that*) three persons had to be fed by Kanperran Manruniraindan *alias* Anbarkadiyan who had taken (*to wife*) the daughter of Adavallan Purvasivan *alias* Pattarganayaga-Pichchan, that three persons had to be fed by Devan Divakaran, the son of her *kolundi* (husbandâ€™s younger sister) and others and that twelve persons pertaining to two shares out of the (*whole*) five, â€” which (*number)* was fed by Tiruchchirrambalakkalan, â€” shall now be fed by the male descendants (*of his*).
