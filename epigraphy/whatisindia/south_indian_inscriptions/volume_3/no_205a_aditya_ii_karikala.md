......The Tamil portion of the grant consists of 524 lines engraved on twenty-one copper-plates. The first 145 lines are actually taken up by the order issued under the authority of the king by his ministers and other officers. The next 281 lines contain a detailed description of the boundary line. The last 98 lines state the conditions and privileges with which the village was granted as a *devadana* to the temple and supply the names of the artisans who engraved the grant. The order was addressed to the headmen of the districts, the headmen of the *brahmadeya* villages and the residents (urar) of the *devadana, pallichchanda, kanimurruttu, vettipperu* and ara-chchalabhogam villages in Menmalai-Palaiyanaur-nadu, a subdivision of Jayangondasolamandalam.
This classification seems apparently to distinguish therevenue villages of the State from those granted to brahmanas, temples, Jaina shrines, Jaina teachers, and service â€” *imams* and charitable feeding houses.
The king being seated in his private room on the upper storey of his palace at Mudigondasolapuram ordered that Palaiyanur in menmalai Palaiyanur-nadu which originally was a *brahmadeya* of the assembly of Singalantaka-chaturvedimangalam in Naduvinmalai Perumur-nadu should from the 6^(th) year and the 88^(th) day of his reign, cease to be a *brahmadeya* and be included under *vellan-vagai* villages. Healso ordered that in consequence the tax 598 *kalanju* and one *kunri* of gold which it was paying with Singalantaka-chaturvedimangalam must now bereduced but that unlike other *vellan-vagai* villages, it must be made to pay as of old[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_205a_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn1) the permanent tax (*in kind*) of 3238 *kalam* 7 *kuruni* and 5 *nali* of paddy together with 193 *kalanju*, 1 *manjadi* and 1 *ma* of gold, including *palli* and be given over as a *devadana* to the temple of Mahadeva at Tiruvalangadu.

Two executive (*karumemarayum*) officers of the king and two arbitrating (*naduvillirukkum*) officers passed the order that the royal writ may be entered in the account books just as it had been signed and issued by the four secretaries (*Olai-nayakam*) on the strength of a letter received from the officer who wrote the orders of the king, evidently under his direct dictation. This order was further supported by the approval and signature of three chief executive officers. Accordingly on the 90^(th) day of the same year, two officers of the department of taxes (*puravuvarithinaikalam*), and the officers called varipothagam, mugavetti, varri pothaga-kanku, variellidu, pattolai and Kizhmugavetti being present, the necessary entries were made in the registers.

Two other officers and a third, perhaps a non-official, were also appointed to superintend the ceremony of going round the granted village and its hamlets accompanied by a female elephant (pidisuzhndhu padagai nadakirathu or in Sanskrit *karinibhramana*). In lines 128-145, we are told that the residents of the district who had also received a royal order to co-operate with the above said officers in walking round the hamlets accompanied by the female elephant, in planting boundary stones and milk-bush and in drawing up the gift deed, met together, went in advance to receive the royal order (Thirumugham) placed it on their heads and making due obeisance to it, walked round the hamlets of Palaiyanur. A short eulogy of the king in Tamil is here inserted in lines 131 to 142. The king is stated to have conquered with his great war-like army Idaitturai-nadu, Vanavasi of extensive forests, Koillippakkadi and Mannaikkadakkam, to have captured the crowns of the king and queen of Ilam (Ceylon), the beautiful crown and other jewels which the Pandya king had deposited with the king of Ilam (Ceylon), the whole island of Ilamandalam, the crown and the garland of the Kerala king and many â€˜ancient islandsâ€™ in the sea. Idaitturai-nadu which was for a long time identified with the country comprising the small taluk of Yedatore in Mysore, has now been satisfactorily proved by Dr. Fleet to be the Raichur doab.[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_205a_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn2)
Kollippakkai has been identified by Mr. Lewis Rice with Kulpak in the Nizamâ€™s Dominions.[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_205a_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn3) It is not unlikely also that Mannaikkadakkam grouped with the two above names, may have to be identified with Manyakheta (Malkhed) in the Nizamâ€™s Dominiions though hitherto it has been taken to be Manne in the Mysore State. Rajendra-Cholaâ€™s seizure of the crowns of the Pandya, Ceylon and Kerala kings must have earned for hi the title Mudigonda Chola which title he appears to have commemorated by founding the town called Mudigondacholapuram.[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_205a_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn4)

The circumambulation of the village by the officers and the district people, accompanied by the female elephant is detailed in the point-to-point description of the boundary line, which commences with 1. 145. The eastern boundary touched the villages, Perumbur,[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_205a_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn5) Kulapadi, Naaipadi, Mangalam and Manaiyil, all of which are stated to have been hamlets of Singalantaka-chaturvedimangalam.[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_205a_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn6)
The southern boundary similarly touched the village Mannalaiyamangalam and Tolugur which were also hamlets Singalantaka-chaturvedimangalam and Kuttukkumundur which was a hamlet of Nittavinoda-chaturvedimangalam.[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_205a_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn7)
Incidentally in the description of this boundary line, reference is made to the high road leading from Tirupasur to Merppadi *alias* Rajasrayapuram which is of much interest, if by men and wheeled traffic. The western boundary touched the villages of Kirainallur, Sakkaranallur,[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_205a_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn8) Karaiappakkam, Midugur[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_205a_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn9) â€” all hamlets of Singalantaka-chaturvedimangalam. The northern boundary touched the villages of Uppur, Ganganerippattu, Polipakkam[\[10\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_205a_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn10) and Kayarpakkam which were also hamlets of Singalantaka-chaturvedimangalam.

The inscription closes with a list of privileges (parihara) which, being a royal prerogative, were transferred from the king to the temple of Tiruvalangadu, on the village Palaiyanur being converted into a *devadana*. The list consisted of several fees, taxes and tolls such as *nadatchi, uratchi, vattinali, pidanali, vannara-parai, kannalakkanam, kusakkanam, idaipattam, tari-irai, taragu* (or *taragu-pattam*), *tattar-pattam, manru-padu, mavirai, tiyeri, virpidi, valamanjadi, nallavu, nallerudu, nadukaval, udupokku, ilaikkulam, nirkuli, ulgu* and *odakkuli.* As I have stated elsewhere it is doubtful if all these terms have to be taken as referring to regular sources of revenue to the State or are to be considered mostly as obligatory services which the king alone could enforce on the people for his personal enjoyment. The list is not exhaustive. The Kasakudi plates mention under *pariharas* a larger number of items. There also it is stated that the palace resigned them in favour of the donee.[\[11\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_205a_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn11) The Leyden plates repeat almost all these terms under *parharas* but mention *tarippudavai* instead of *tari-irai* and add the new term *attukkirai*. The Velurpalaiyam and the Tandandottam plates published above add the terms *puravu-pon, tirumukkanam, tattukkayam, ilamputchi, idaipputchi* (perhaps same as *idaippattam*), *kulam* (perhaps same as *ilaikkulam)*, *paraikkanam[\[12\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_205a_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn12) pattinaseri, ulaviyakkuli, urettu, angadikkuli[\[13\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_205a_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn13) kadaiyadaikkay* and *uppu-korchchaigai*. A set of *vyavasthas* (*i.e., conditions of grant)* were also imposed on the donee. Here again the exact import of these conditions has not been properly understood. Some have taken it to be only permissive rights just like the privileges mentioned above, granted to the donee ; but it would look apparently to be different when we see that permission to build houses of bricks, to dig wells, to plant coconut trees in rows, or to plant sweet-scented verbina, may not generally have required a license. Still such are the conditions (*vyavastha*) mentioned *viz.,* that mansions and large edifices shall be built of burnt bricks ; wells and reservoirs shall be dug ; coconut trees shall be planted in groves ; *maruvu*, *damanagam, iruveli, senbagam*, red-lilies, mango, jack, coconut, areca and such other trees shall be put in and planted ; large oil-presses shall be set up and that toddy-drawers shall not climb the coconut and palmyra trees within the boundaries of the granted village. One or two other *vyavastha* regarding the irrigation of lands also deserve to be noted.
Usually the distribution of water for irrigation in each village appears to have been fixed by some common understanding. This allotted quantity of water, the grant states, shall be utilized by digging canals.
Cultivators to whom the canal is not intended shall not cut open branch channels from it, nor bund up the water, nor raise it by small piccotas, nor bale it out by baskets; and those who have the right shall make the most economical use of the water without wasting it.[\[14\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_205a_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn14) Canals flowing across other villages to irrigate the lands of this village and *vice versa* shall be permitted to flow over the boundary line and to cast up silt.[\[15\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_205a_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn15)
Besides, the embankments of tanks shall be allowed to be raised within their limits, so that they may hold the maximum quantity of water.
