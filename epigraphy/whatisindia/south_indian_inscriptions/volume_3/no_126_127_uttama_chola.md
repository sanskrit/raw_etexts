**No. 126.â€” ON THE SOUTH WALL OF THE MANDAPA IN FRONT OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE IN THE CHANDRASEKARA TEMPLE AT TIRUCHCHENDURAI**[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_126_127_uttama_chola.html#_ftn1)

This inscription, dated in the 2^(nd) year of Parakesarivarman, registers a grant of land by Pudi Adittapidari to the stone temple built by her at Tiruchchendurai, to meet the cost of the expenses of a festival in connection with the solar eclipse. Pudi Adittapidari may have been a daughter of Pudi or Maravan Pudiyar referred to in another inscription of king Parakesarivarman at Tiruchchendurai[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_126_127_uttama_chola.html#_ftn2).
The king Parakesarivarman himself has to be identified with either Madhu rantaka Uttama-Chola or Aditya Karikala II. both of whom held the title Parakesarivarman[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_126_127_uttama_chola.html#_ftn3).
The provision made for festivals on the day of the solar eclipse might suggest that in this second year of king Parakesarivarman there should have been at least one such eclipse. If Parakesarivarman is identified with Madhurantaka uttama-Chola who succeeded to the throne in A.D. 971, we find that according to Dr. Schramâ€™s â€œ*Eclipses of the Sun in India*,â€? there were two solar eclipses in the year 972 which was the second year of Uttama-Chola. Consequently it is not unlikely that the king referred to in this inscription Uttama â€“ Chola.

Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 2^(nd) year of (*the reign of*) Parakesarivarman I, Pudi Adittapidari, gave with libation of water these two garden (*lands*) as per the same terms under which I purchased (*them*) (*viz.,)* the garden (*land*) which I purchased for 35 *kalanju* of gold in the second year (*of the kingâ€™s reign*) from Kachchuvan (Kasyapa) Tattanarayanan and thegarden (*land)* purchased from Paradayan (*Bharadvaja ?*) Isana Maran, to the lord of the stone temple at Tiruchchendurai for maintaining festivals (*tiruvilappuram*) of the lord of Tiruchchendurai for maintaining festivals (*tiruvilappuram*) of the lord of Tiruchchendurai on (*the day of*) the solar eclipse, (*stipulating that*) the maintenance of the (*said*) festivals of the lord of (*this*) stone temple constructed by me Pudi Adittapidari (*should be met only*) from the produce of the (*said*) gardens. (*The assembly of*) all *Mahesvaras* shall protect this
(*charity)*

**No. 127.- ON THE WEST WALL OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE IN THE GHRITASTHANESVARA TEMPLE AT TILLASTHANAM**[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_126_127_uttama_chola.html#_ftn4)

This inscription is dated in the 3^(rd) year of Parakesarivarman and registers a gift of gold for a lamp by a certain Korran Arunmoli *alias* Vanavan Peraraiyan of Arrur in Mangadu-nadu. The money presented was apparently utilized in purchasing a land which adjoined another granted by Nangai Varaguna-Perumanar. This lady had been already referred to as the wife of Parantaka Ilangovelar and to have made a grant of land to the same temple in the 13^(th) year of Rajakesarivarman (Gandaraditya).
It is now difficult to determine who this king Parakesarivarman is in whose reign the gift of Varaguna-Perumanar could be referred to.
Subsequent to Gandaraditya who ruled for about 18 years there must have ruled at least four kings before rajaraja I. succeeded to the throne in A.D. 985. viz., - Arimjaya, Sundara Chola Parantaka II., Aditya Karikala and Uttama-Chola of whom the first probably and the two last bore the surnames Parakesarivarman. Consequently Parakesarivarman of our inscription must be identified with either Arimajaya whose records have not been found hitherto or with Uttama-Chola. In all probability the reference appears to be the latter.

Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 3^(rd) year of (*the reign of*) king Parakesarivarman, Korran Arunmoli *alias* Vanavan Peraraiyan a native of Arrur (*a village*) in \[Ma\]ngadu-nadu, gave \[25 *kalanju*\] of gold for burning one perpetual lamp day and night . . . . . . . . . . . at Tiruneyttanam. Having received this twenty-five *kalanju* of gold . . . . . .. . . . . . .. quarter *sey* (*of land*) given for a lamp by Nangai Varaguna-Perumanar; the northern boundary (*is*) to the south of (*the channel called*) Andanurvaykkal and the western boundary (*is*)
to the east of the mound which has never been leveled (*for cultivation*). We, the assembly, the villagers (*urom*) and the temple servants (*devakanmi*) of Tiruneyttanam sold to Koran Arunmoli *alias* Vanavan Peraraiyan (*the land*) situated within the four great boundaries thus described without excluding any (*portion)* of the land within (*unnilam*) and executed a sale-deed (*vilai-avanam*). (*The assembly of*) all *Mahesvaras* shall protect this (*charity*)
