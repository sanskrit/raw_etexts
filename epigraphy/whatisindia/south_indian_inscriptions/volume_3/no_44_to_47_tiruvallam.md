**No. 44.- On the north wall of the Mahamandapa in the Bilvanathesvara temple**

As stated in the introductory remarks to No. 43, the subjoined inscription was copied from an earlier stone inscription when the *mandapa* of the temple was pulled down and re-erected. It is dated in the Saka year 810 (in words, 1. 4 f.) and in the time of a Bana chief who is not mentioned by name, but only by his title Mahavalivanaraja (1. 3 f.).

The inscription records that a Brahmana of Ettukkur near Kavirippakkam (II. 10 to 12) paid 25 *kalanju* of gold to the villagers of Vannipedu (!!. 5 and 19), who, in return, pledged themselves to supply oil to a lamp in the temple. Kavirippakkam is the modern Kaveripakkam,[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_44_to_47_tiruvallam.html#_ftn1) and Vannipedu is the modern Vannivedu,[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_44_to_47_tiruvallam.html#_ftn2) about a mile south of Walajapet. At the time of the inscription Vannipedu belonged to Karai-nadu, a subdivision of the district of Paduvur-kottam (1. 5). Karai-nadu owes its name to Karai,[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_44_to_47_tiruvallam.html#_ftn3) a village on the north of Ranipet.

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! (*During the reign*) of) Mahavalivanaraja, - \[born from the family of Mahabali\], who had been made door-keeper by the lord of gods and demons, Paramesvara (*Siva*), who is worshipped in all the three worlds, - in the Saka year eight hundred and ten, - we, the assembly of Vannipedu, *alias* Ranavikrama-chaturvedimangalam, in Karai-nadu, (*a* *subdivision*) of Paduvur-kottam, received twenty-five *kalanju* of gold, weighed by the balance (*used in the case*) of charitable edicts,[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_44_to_47_tiruvallam.html#_ftn4) from Madhava-Kramavittan of Ettukkur, a hamlet on the north-east of Kavirippakkam, *alias* A\[va\]ninarayana-chaturvedimangalam, in the same *kottam* in order to supply (*one*) *ulakku* (*and one*) *alakku* of oil per day for burning one sacred perpetual lamp, as long as the moon and the sun exist, before (*the god*) Tiruttikkali-Perumanadigal of Tikkali-Vallam in Miyaru-nadu, (*a subdivision*) of the same *kottam*.

(L. 13.) We, the assembly, shall have to continue this charity without fail, so as to burn (*the lamp*) as long as the moon and the sun exist.

(L. 15.) If (*they*) fail in this charity, all the *Mahesvaras* shall be liable to pay into court[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_44_to_47_tiruvallam.html#_ftn5) a
fine[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_44_to_47_tiruvallam.html#_ftn6) of five *kalanju* of gold per day.

(L. 17.) Though paying this fine, we, the assembly of Vannipedu, *alias* Ranavikrama-chaturvedimangalam, shall have to continue this sacred perpetual lamp without fail.

(L. 20.) Those who obstruct this (*charity*), shall incur (*all*) the sins committed between the Ganga and Kumari.[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_44_to_47_tiruvallam.html#_ftn7)

(L. 22.) This (*charity is placed under*) the protection of all *Mahesvaras*.

**No. 45.- On the south wall of the Bilvanathesvara shrine**

Like the preceding inscription, this one is dated in the time of some Mahavalivanaraya. As the alphabet looks decidedly more modern than that of Nos. 42 and 46 and resembles that of Nos. 47 and 48, it must be assumed that like the two last-mentioned inscriptions, this one is a copy, which was prepared when the central shrine was pulled down and rebuilt.

The inscription records that an inhabitant of Ponpadukuttam near Kachchippedu, *i.e.,* Kanchipuram,[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_44_to_47_tiruvallam.html#_ftn8) purchased some land from the inhabitants of Tiruvallam. The produce of the land had to be used for providing offerings and for feeding a lamp in the temple.

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! While the glorious Mahavalivanaraya,- born from the family of Mahabali, who had been made door-keeper by the lord of gods and demons, Paramesvara (Siva), who is worshipped in all the three worlds, - was ruling the earth, we, the assembly of Tikkali-Vallam in Miyaru-nadu, received from Soliyavaraiyan, *alias* Manabharanan, of Ponpadukuttam, a tax-paying village (*near*) Kachchippedu, twenty *kalanju* of gold, in order to supply without fail, as long as the moon and the sun exist, two *nali* of pounded rice and (*one*) *alakku* of fresh ghee for fixed daily offerings which he had granted to (*the god*) Tikkali-Perumanadigal, and twenty *kalanju* of gold in order to supply (*one*) *ulakku* (*and one*) *alakku* of oil per day for burning a perpetual lamp before the same god. Having received altogether forty *kalanju* of gold, we, the assembly, shall have to continue the offerings and the perpetual lamp as long as the moon and the sun exist.

(L. 3.) Those who say that this charity is not (*existing*), shall incur (*all*) sins committed between the Ganga and Kumari. This charity (*is placed under*) the protection of all *Mahesvaras*. The feet of those who protect this charity (*shall be*) on my head.

(L. 4.) We, the assembly, gave 500 *kuli* of land (*called*) Vagaikkundil *and 800 kuli* (called) *Puravadukollai* in the environs[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_44_to_47_tiruvallam.html#_ftn9) of the village, which (he) had granted, free of taxes, for (*supplying*) these daily offerings and for (*maintaining*) the perpetual lamp.

(L. 5.) We, the assembly, gave 2 *nilam[\[10\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_44_to_47_tiruvallam.html#_ftn10)*
and 400 *kuli* of land (*called*) *Ku*\[*ra*\]*ngadi* which (*he*) had granted for the worshipping *Siva-Brahmana*.

**No. 46.- On a stone built into the floor of the Bilvanathesvara temple**

The alphabet of this inscription is Tamil and Grantha of an archaic type and resembles that of the rock inscription No. 42. It records a gift of gold for maintaining a lamp by the queen of Vanavidyadhara-Vanaraya. As will be shown below (p. 99), this king may be identified with Vikramaditya I., the sixth of the Bana chiefs whose names are given in the Udayendiram plates.[\[11\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_44_to_47_tiruvallam.html#_ftn11)
Nos. 47 and 48, which record grants by a queen of the same king, as well as Nos. 43 and 44, are copies of lost originals[\[12\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_44_to_47_tiruvallam.html#_ftn12) and hence exhibit comparatively modern characters. The archaic alphabet of the subjoined inscription and the fact that it is engraved on a single stone, which does not form part of the temple itself, prove that it is an original record of the time of Vanavidyadhara. Evidently it owes its preservation to the accident that, when the central shrine and the *mandapa* were rebuilt, the stone, which bears it, was utilized for the new pavement of the temple.

**No. 47.- On the west wall of the Bilvanthesvara shrine**

This inscription and No. 48 are written continuously, the first few words of No. 48 occupying the end of line 4 of No. 47. At the beginning of
