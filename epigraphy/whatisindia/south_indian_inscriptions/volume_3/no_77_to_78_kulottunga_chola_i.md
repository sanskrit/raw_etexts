**No. 77.- Inscription at Kavantandalam**

In chronological order this inscription follows immediately after No. 67 above, and No. 78 after No. 68 above. It was found impossible to insert them in their proper places, because Nos. 64 and 76 had been already set up in pages when Nos. 77 and 78 were copied. Besides these two records, the following inscriptions commencing with pugazhmadhu villanga were copied in 1901, in addition to those noted under clause VIII. On page 126 above : -

30\. 36^(th) year : Tenneri, No. 195 of 1901.

31\. 41^(st) year : Tenneri No. 197 of 1901.

32\. 42^(nd) year : Achcharapakkam, No. 254 of 1901.

33\. 43^(rd) year : Achcharapakkam No. 259 of 1901.

34\. 49^(th) year : Achcharapakkam, No. 256 of 1901.

The subjoined inscription (No. 206 of 1901) is engraved on the south wall of the Lakshminarayana temple at Kavantandalam. The same temple contains three earlier inscriptions (Nos. 207 to 209 to 1901), according to which it was built in the time of the Ganga-Pallava king Kampavarman[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_77_to_78_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn1) by a certain Manasarpa from Kulanur[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_77_to_78_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn2) in Vengai-nadu.

The inscription, which is incomplete, is dated in the 4^(th) year of the reign of Rajendra-Chola II., but omits the reference to his queen which occurs in the Somangalam inscription of the 3^(rd) year (No. 67 above).
It records the proceedings of a meeting of the assembly of Kayvantandalam (1. 3) in Tamanur-nadu, a subdivision of the district of Urrukkattu-kottam Kavantandalam, Tamanur[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_77_to_78_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn3) and Urrukkadu[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_77_to_78_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn4) are all included in the modern Conjeeveram taluka.[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_77_to_78_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn5)

(Line 2.) Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 4^(th) year (*of the reign*) of king Rajakesarivarman, *alias* the lord Sri-Rajendra-Soladeva, who *etc.,* - we, the great assembly of Kayvantandalam, *alias* Chaturvedimangalam, a *brahmadeya* in Tamanur-nadu, (*a subdivision*) of Urrukkattu-kottam, (*a district*) of Jayangonda-Sola-mandalam, being assembled, without a vacancy in the assembly,[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_77_to_78_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn6) in the court (*murram*) of the sacred temple of Virrirund-Alvar in the middle of our village on a Thursday which corresponded to (*the day of*) Tiruvonam (*Sravana*) and to the sixth *tithi* of the first fortnight of the month of Vrischika in this year,[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_77_to_78_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn7) ordered (*the following*) writing, while the magistrate (*adhikarain*) Sola-Muvendavelar[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_77_to_78_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn8) also was walking about.

**No. 78 Inscription at Perumber**

This inscription (No. 264 of 1901) is engraved on the west wall of the *mandapa* in front of the Tandonrisvara temple at Perumber in the Madurantakam taluka of the Chingleput district. The ancient name of the temple was Srikaranisvara (1. 22), and that of the village was Perumberur (II. 22 and 23). From this and other inscriptions we learn that Sri-Madurantaka-chaturvedimangalam, which is the modern Madurantakam, formed a separate division of the district of Kalattur-kottam[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_77_to_78_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn9) (I. 21) ; that Achcharapakkam (9 miles south-south-west of Madurantakam) was a quarter of it ; and that Perumberur (3 miles south-west of achcharapakkam) was a hamlet on the south of it (I. 22).

The date is the 11^(th) year of the reign of Kulottunga I. (1. 20 f.).
As stated in the introductory remarks to this chapter (p. 129 f.), the inscription carries the account of the kingâ€™s achievements as far as the defeat of Vikkalan and the conquest of Gangamandalam and Singanam.
It records that the assembly of Madurantakam remitted the taxes on certain land at Perumberur in favour of the temple, and breaks off with the signatures of a number of citizens in charge of different portions (*seri*) of the city, which were named after Chola kings.

To the list of inscriptions opening with pukazh suzhntha punari on p. 125 f. the following one, which I had overlooked, must be added : -

16\. 15^(th) year : Kadapperi near Madurantakam, No. 138 of 1896.

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! While the wheel of his (*authority*) went as far as the golden circle (*i.e.,* Mount Meru) on the earth, which was surrounded by the moat of the sea, that was (*again*) surrounded by (*his*) fame, (*the king*) newly wedded, in the time (*when he was still*) heir-apparent, the brilliant goddess of Victory at Sakkarakottam by deeds of valour and seized a herd of mountains of rut (*i.e.,* rutting elephants) at Vayiragaram.

(L. 4.) (*He*) unsheathed (*his*) sword, showed the strength of (*his*) arm, established (*his*) fame, and spurred (*his*) war-steed, so that the army of the king of Kuntala, (*whose spear had*) a harp point, retreated.

(L. 5.) Having put on the garland of (*the victory over)* the Northern region, (*he*) came to put a stop to the prostitution of the goddess with the sweet and excellent lotus-flower (*i.e.,* Lakshmi) of the Southern region and to the loneliness of the goddess of the good country whose garment is the Ponni, and put on by right (*of inheritance*) the pure royal crown of jewels, while the kings of the old earth bore his two feet (*on their heads*) as a large crown.

(L. 8. The river (*of the rules*) of the ancient king Manu swelled, (*and*) and river (*of the sins*) of the Kali (*age*) dried up. (*His*) sceptre swayed over every region ; the heavenly white light of (*his*) white parasol shone everywhere (*on*) the circle of the great earth ; (*and his*) tiger (-*banner*) fluttered unrivalled on the Meru *(mountain*).
