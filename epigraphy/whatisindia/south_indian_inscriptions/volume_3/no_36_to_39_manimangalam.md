It records that a military officer purchased 600 *kuli* of land near the village and assigned them to the temple, with the condition that the produce of the land should be applied for providing offerings of boiled rice to the god.

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity !

No. 37.- On the east wall of the mandapa in the Rajagopala-Perumal temple.

This inscription is dated in the 28^(th) year of the reign of Kulottunga-Choladeva III. and records that the same military officer who is mentioned in the preceding inscription (*or a relation of his*) deposited with the temple authorities a sum of money, from the interest of which four lamps had to be supplied with fuel.

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 28^(th) year (*of the reign*) of the emperor of the three worlds, Sri-Kulottunga-Soladeva, who was pleased to take Madurai and the crowned head of the Pandya, - we two, Arattamikkidasan,[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_36_to_39_manimangalam.html#_ftn8) the overseer of the *Sri-Vaishnavas* in (*the temple of*) Vanduvarapati at Manimangalam in Kunrattur-nadu, (*a subdivision*) of Jayankonda-Sola-mandalam, and Sridhara-Bhatttan, who holds the feet of the god[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_36_to_39_manimangalam.html#_ftn9) of the central shrine, received from Kannappan Panchanedi Nilagangaraiyar of Tiruchchuram seven and seven twentieths old *kasu*, to bear interest from the month of *Karttigai* of this year.

(L. 10.)In return for *(this sum*), we, the authorities of the temple, agreed to burn, as long as the moon and the sun exist, four lamps, (*viz.)* two twilight lamps in the Vanduvarapati (*temple*), one twilight lamp in the central shrine, and one twilight lamp which (*the two temples of*) Tiruvaiyotti[\[10\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_36_to_39_manimangalam.html#_ftn10) and Tiruvayappadi have to burn in the Vanduvarapati (*temple*).

No. 38.- On the outside of the east wall of the inner prakara of the Rajagopala-Perumal temple.

This inscription is dated in the 13^(th) year of the reign of Rajarajadeva (III.?). It registers several payments of money into the temple treasury for feeding lamps in the temple.

Hail ! Prosperity ! In the thirteenth year (*of the reign*) of Rajarajadeva, - under the supervision of both Arulala-Bhattan of Irayur, the manager of the temple of Vanduvarapati-Emberuman at Manimangalam, *alias* Pandiyanai-irumadiven-konda-Sola-chaturvedimangalam, in Kunrattur-nadu, (*a subdivision*) of Kulottunga-Sola-valanadu, (*a district*) of Jayankonda-Sola-mandalam, and of Vanduvarapati . . . . . . . . . . . . the overseer of the *Sri-Vaishnavas* in this temple, - (the following sums) were paid on interest into the treasury of the temple of Vanduvarapati-Emberuman, as a fund for burning lamps at evening dawn before this *Emberuman* : - one *kasu* by Arlala-Bhattan of Irayur ; one *kasu* b Mattu\[va\]li Sirilango-Bhattan ; one *kasu* by Emberuman-Adiyal \[Vi\]langavand\[a\]r of Minjur ; and one and a half *kasu*, for burning a lamp at evening dawn, by Kannandai Kuppan of Porungunram.

No. 39. â€“ On the east wall of the mandapa in the Rajagopala-Perumal temple.

The subjoined inscription belongs to the 18^(th) year of the reign of *Tribhuvanachakravartin* Rajarajadeva. This king is probably identical with Rajaraja III., who is known to have ascended the throne about A.D. 1216 and seems to have been the immediate successor of Kulottunga-Chola III.[\[11\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_36_to_39_manimangalam.html#_ftn11)
In this case the week-day on which the inscription is dated will admit of astronomical calculation. The inscription records that a flight of stone steps leading to *mandapa* was built at the expense of two brothers.

Hail ! Prosperity ! With the approval of the god,[\[12\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_36_to_39_manimangalam.html#_ftn12) - in the 18^(th) year (*of the reign*) of the emperor of the three worlds, Sri-Rajarajadeva, on the day of *Dhanishtha*, which corresponded to a Wednesday and to the fifth *tithi* of the first fortnight of the month of *Dhanus,* - Brahmapriyan, the
