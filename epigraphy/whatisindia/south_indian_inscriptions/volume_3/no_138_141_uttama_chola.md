**No. 138.- ON THE SOUTH WALL OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE IN THE MAHALINGASVAMIN TEMPLE AT TIRUVIDAIMARUDUR**[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_138_141_uttama_chola.html#_ftn1)

The importance of this inscription consists in the fact that it furnishes both the Kaliyuga yer and the regnal year of king Uttama-Chola and thus enables us to fix the yearof accession of this soverign. Since the 13^(th) year of the king corresponded to Kali 4083 ( = a.D. 981-82), it follows that he must have ascended the throne in A.D. 969-70. His latest year known so far is the 16^(th) which brings the close of his reign down to the date of accession of his successor Rajaraja I. which has been calculated and found to be 985-86 A.D.

The name Simhavishnu-chaturvedimangalam given to Kanjanur shows that the conquest of the Chola dominion by the Pallava king Simhavishnu so specifically claimed for him in the Velurpalaiyam plates,[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_138_141_uttama_chola.html#_ftn2) must evidently have been based on actual facts.

Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 13^(th) year of (the reign of) Uttama-Chola *alias* king Parakesarivarman, (corresponding to) the Kaliyuga year four thousand and eighty-three, . . . . . .. . . . the big assembly of Kanjanur *alias* Simhavishnu-chaturvedimangalam, a *brahmadeya* in Vadagarai Nallarrur-nadu. . . . . . . . . . . . .. .

**No. 139.- ON THE SOUTH WALL OF THE MANDAPA IN FRONT OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE IN THE VATATIRTHANATHA TEMPLE AT ANDANALLUR**[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_138_141_uttama_chola.html#_ftn3)

This is an unfinished inscription, dated in the 14^(th) year of Parakesarivarman. It registers a grant of land, by Sembiyan Irukkuvel *alias* Pudi Parantakan, to the temple at Anduvanallur Tiruvalandurai, which he had himself built. The donor has been identified by the late RaiBahadur Venkayya, with Paantakavarman the son of the Kodumbalur chief Vikramakesarin. Consequently king Parakesarivarman may be identified with uttama-Chola.[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_138_141_uttama_chola.html#_ftn4)

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! Obeisance to Siva ! In the 14^(th) year of (*the reign of*) king Parakesarivarman, on the day when Sembiyan Irukkuvel *alias* Pudi Parantakan, having constructed a stone temple to the god (*paramesvara*) at Anduvanallur-Tiruvalandurai in Kiliyur-nadu, sprinkled (*it*) with water (i.e., consecrated it), (*he*) gave as *devadanam* at Mullikkurumbu of Uraiyur-kurram in the (*plot of land measuring*) 8 Â½ (*veli*) the village (i.e., land)[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_138_141_uttama_chola.html#_ftn5) 7 Â½ (*veli*) which was the remainder (l*eft*) after deducting the (*one*) *veli* of old *devadana* (*land*) of the god. From these 7 Â½ (*veli* *of land*) the (*following*) arrangement (*nivanda*) was made for temple expenses : -

(L. 7.) One (*veli*) and a quarter and half *ma* for (*worship in*) the temple (*sennadai*) ; two *veli* of land for eight sacred perpetual lamps; (*one*) *veli* for four *manis[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_138_141_uttama_chola.html#_ftn6)* ; ten (*ma*) for two conch (*blowers*); ten (*ma*) for two trumpet (*blowers*) ; three *ma* and a half for one (who beats the) going ; a quarter (*veli)* for two sacred flower-garlands; seven *ma* and a half, for three coatings (*of the* *god*) with sandal-paste) ; three quarter (*veli*) of land for 3 *ulakku* of ghee daily at the rate of (*one*) *ulakku* each time; a quarter (*veli*) for (*sounding*) one *karadigai* ; . . . . . . . . . . for \[signing\] the *tiruppadiyam*.

**No. 140.- ON THE SOUTH WALL OF THE GANESA SHRINE IN THE NEDUNGALANATHA TEMPLE AT TIRUNEDUGALAM**[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_138_141_uttama_chola.html#_ftn7)

The inscription is dated in the 14^(th) year of Parakesarivarman. It registers the gift of the produce of the certain field in Kalarikurichchi, for expenses in connexion with the fire oblations (agnikarya) in the temple at Tirunedungalam in Kavira-nadu. The king is probably identical with Uttama-Chola after whom Uttamasola-Brahmadhiraja mentioned in the inscription, was so called.

Hail ! Prospertiy ! In the 14^(th) year of (the reign of) king Parakesarivarman, Velvetti-Govindabhatan, who manages the temple business (*srikaryam*) for Sembiyan Vadapuraiyurnattu-Muvendavelar, a servant (*kanmi*) of Uttamasola-Brahmadhiraja, thus made the following arrangement for fire oblations (*agnikarya*) (*to be conducted*) daily at the three junctures (*of the* *day*) (*in the temple*) of this god Mahadeva (*Siva*) of Tirunedungalam in Kaviranadu. Receiving the twelve *kalam* of paddy that shall be measured out annually to us from (*the field* ?) Miyvakkankarai in Kalarikurichchi (*a village situated*) in this *nadu*, we, the trustees of this sacred temple agree to secure for (*each*) time, half *pidi* of ghee, *meleri[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_138_141_uttama_chola.html#_ftn8)* (*and*) other things required for the *agnikarya* and have it performed. This (*shall be under*) the protection of all *Mahesvaras.*

**No. 141.- ON THE WEST WALL OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE IN THE MASILAMANISVARA TEMPLE AT TIRUMULLAIVAYIL**[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_138_141_uttama_chola.html#_ftn9)

This inscription which is dated in the 14^(th) year of king Parakesarivarman Uttama-Choladeva registers a gift of land to the temple at Tirumullaivayil by Sembiyanmadeviyar the daughter of Malavaraiyar and queen of Gandaraditya-Perumal. The land was purchased by her from the assembly of Ambattur in Ambattur-nadu which was a subdivision of Pular-kottam. Tirumullaivayil and Ambattur mentioned in the record are villages in the Saidapet taluk of the Chingleput district.

The characters of the inscription are of a period much later than that to which the record belongs. It is probably a copy.

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 14^(th) year of (*the reign of*) king Parakesarivarman *alias* Uttama-Choladeva, we (*the members*) of the assembly of Ambattur in Ambattur-nadu (*which is a* *subdivision)* of Pular-kottam, having received eighty *kalanju* of gold from Sembiyanmadeviyar, the daughter of Malavaraiyar and queen of the glorious Gandaraditya-Perumal gave the (*following*) land (*called*) Kileripattu after exempting (*it*)  
from (*all*) taxes. (*Its boundaries are*):
