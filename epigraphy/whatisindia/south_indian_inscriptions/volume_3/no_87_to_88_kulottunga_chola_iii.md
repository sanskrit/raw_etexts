**No. 87.- Inscription at Chidambaram**

This inscription (No. 458 of 1902) is engraved on the same wall as the preceding one (No. 86). It is dated on the 118^(th) day of the 11^(th) year of Kulottunga-Chola III. and records that the king sanctioned a grant of land to the temple by a certain Valuvarayan (II. 5 and 12).
The land granted was situated in the same two hamlets of Chidambaram which were mentioned in No. 86, *viz.,* Mahipalakulakalanallur (1. 6) and Kaavayachcheri *alias* Tillainayaganallur (1. 8). Chidambaram itself is referred to as Perumbarrappuliyur in Rajadhiraja-valanadu (1. 5), and its Siva temple as Tiruchchirrambalam-udaiyar (1. 9.).
