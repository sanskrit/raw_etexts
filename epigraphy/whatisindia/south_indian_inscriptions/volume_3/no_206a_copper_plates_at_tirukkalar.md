...Of king Jatila, the second in the genealogical list (D) given above, nothing is stated in the plates in the Sanskrit portion, the Tamil portion omitting his name altogether. On the hypothesis, however, of Arikesari Parankusa being identical with Termaran of the Velvikudi grant, Jatila will have to be identified with (No. 7) Parantaka Nedujadaiyan, thedonor of the Velvikudi grant â€” it being inexplicable, however, why this king of whom we hear so much in the Velvikudi and in the Madras Museum plates, should have been mentioned without any remarks in the Sanskrit portion and omitted altogether in the Tamil portion. The other kings who follow are later names in the Pandya genealogy and their achievements are detailed in the genealogical table (D) given above.

The successor of Jatila was Rajasimha (II)[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_206a_copper_plates_at_tirukkalar.html#_ftn1) of whom nothing is stated. After him came Varaguna or Varaguna-Maharaja of great prowess who was separated by two generations or roughly 50 years from Termaran (No. 6 of A) the contemporary of Pallavamalla Nandivarman already mentioned. Consequently, he should have flourished about he beginning of the 9^(th) century A.D. Though very scanty information is supplied about this king by the bigger Sinnamanur plates, still he is familiar to students of epigraphy and we know of very many references in inscriptions to Varaguna or Varaguna-Maharaja[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_206b_copper_plates_at_tirukkalar.html#_ftn2), sometimes also called Maranjadaiyan. We learn, e.g., that Varaguna, for the first time, carried his conquests northward into the Chola country against Idavai[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_206b_copper_plates_at_tirukkalar.html#_ftn3) on which occasion also he should perhaps have destroyed the fortified walls of Vembil (Vembarrur). Varaguna thence pushed further north into the Tondai-nadu making there a grant from his camp at Araisur, a village on the banks of the Pennar to the temple of Erichcha-Udaiyar at Ambasamudram in the Tinnevelly district. Again, a inscription at Kalugumalai[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_206b_copper_plates_at_tirukkalar.html#_ftn4), also in the Tinnevelly district, supports the above statement by referring to an expedition of the king (herein called only Maranjadaiyan) against Arividurkkottai and casually mentions the village Pundanamali (i.e., Poonamalli) in Tondai-nadu. The Tiruvisalur inscription dated in the 4^(th) year of the reign of Varaguna-Maharaja might also belong to this same king[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_206b_copper_plates_at_tirukkalar.html#_ftn5).
The Aivarmalai inscription which supplies the initial date Saka 784 or A.D. 862 to Varaguna must refer to the later Varagunavarman who was the grandson of Varaguna I. An inscription from Tiruvellarai which is dated in his 13^(th) year, and where the king is called Maranjadaiyan supplies astronomical details for the verification of the date. The actual calculation, worked out by Mr. Sewell at page 253 of *Ep. Ind*., Vol. XI, fits in with the 13^(th) year of this Varagunavarman II, viz., Monday the 22^(nd) November, A.D. 874. This is the second sure date in the Pandya

chronology, the first being A.D. 769-70 (or thereabouts) of the Anamalai inscription, for king Maranjadaiyan Parantaka, Nedunjadaiyan, the donor of the Velvikudi grant and of the Madras Museum plates. Thus the initial date of Varaguna II got from the Aivarmalai inscription, is A.D. 862 and the nearest possible date of Parantake Nedunjadaiyan is A.D. 770. The difference between these two dates *i.e.,* 92 years, suggests at least four generations and Rai Bahadur Venkayya has, accordingly in his genealogical table of the Pandyas given at page 54 of his *Annual Report on Epigraphy* for 1908, Part II, taken the Varaguna of the Aivarmalai inscription to be the second of that name who, according to the Udayendiram plates, killed the Ganga king Prithvipati I in the battle at Sripurambiyam or Tiruppurambiyam near Kumbhakonam, being himself subsequently defeated by the last Pallava king Aparajita or Aparajitavikramavarman son of Nripatunga[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_206b_copper_plates_at_tirukkalar.html#_ftn6).
Leaving alone the second Varagunavarman for the present, it may be stated that in the time of Varaguna-Maharaja I the Pandya dominion was largely extended as to include in it the Chola and the Pallava country right up to the bank of the Pennar in Tondai-nadu. This invasion could not have been allowed to pass without severe resistance by the kings concerned, viz., the Cholas and the Pallavas, and consequently, we see that in the next reign king Srivallabha (10) had to fight fierce battles, three of them being at Kudamukkil, i.e., Kumbhakonam in the heart of the Chola country, against perhaps the allied Cholas, Gangas and Pallavas.[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_206b_copper_plates_at_tirukkalar.html#_ftn7)
This was perhaps the commencement of the struggle. It perhaps ended only with the defeat of Varaguna II, by the Pallava king Aparajita at Sripurambiyam, near Kumbhakonam, where his Ganga ally Prithivipati I also died. The Chola enemies of the Pandyas, now turned against their allies, the Pallavas Rajakesarivarman Aditya I overran the Tondai-nadu in the north and occupied it. But the Pandya king Rajasimha III (No. 13), the son of Parantaka (Sadaiyan, defeated the king of Tanjai (Tanjore) at Naippur, fought a battle at Kodumbai (Kodumbalur) the seat of one of the powerful Chola subordinates, burnt Vanji anddestroyed the king of southern Tanjai (perhaps another subordinate of the Cholas) at Naval. Adityaâ€™s son Parantaka I defeated this rajasimha-Pandya, the nephew of Varaguna II and captured the Pandya capital Madura, thereby acquiring for himself the well-known title Madiraikonda. The mention of Maya-Pandya as in rebellious union against Srivallabha (10) and that of Ugra (perhaps also a Pandya king) against Parantaka Viranarayana Sadaiyan (12) show internal dissensions in the Pandya family which must have been the cause of their eventual downfall. The Pandya king Parantaka appears to have courted the friendship of the rising powerful Chola and to have married Vanavanmahadevi, evidently a Chola princess as the title[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_206b_copper_plates_at_tirukkalar.html#_ftn8) the flag of both the lunar and the solar racesâ€™ borne by his son Rajasimha clearly shows.

Of the topographical and other proper names mentioned in both the sets of Sinnamanur plats, viz., Chitramuyari, Talaiyalanganam, Nelveli, Sankaramangai, Kunnur, Singalam, Vilinam, Kudamukkil, Sennilam, Kharagiri, Pennagadam, Kongu, Ulappinimangalam, Tanjai, Naippur, Kodumbai, Vanji \[on the northern bank of the Ponni (Kaveri) river\], Naval Chulal, Rajasingapperungulakkil, Narcheygaiputtur, Ala-nadu, Puttur, Miygundaru, Koluvur-kurram, Maniyachi or Tisaichchudarmangalam, Vada-Kalavalinadu, Pullamangalam, Sola-nadu, Vembarrur in Kalavali-nadu, Kura in Kil-Vemba-nadu, Suruli-aru (river), Marudur, Kuvalaimalai, Korranputtur, Kundur and Anda-nadu, almost all are familiar and known to us from inscriptions. The first two are not identified, the second being known only to literature. Kudamukkil is Kumbhakonam ; Vilinam is a port in the Travancore State ; Singalam in Ceylon ; Pennagadam is a village in the Tanjore District ; Kongu comprises the modern districts of Salem and Coimbatore ; Tanjai is the well-known Tanjore ; Kodumbai is Kodumbalur in the Pudukkottai State. Rajasingakulakkil may be identified with Rajasingamangalam in the Sivaganga Zaminari. It is called Varagunamangalam in its inscriptions. Narcheygaiputtur must be identical with Sinnamnur in the Periyakulam taluk where these plates were obtained. The stone inscriptions of the place, however, show that it bore the name Arikesarinallur and was a *brahmadeya* in Ala-nadu, a subdivision of Pandi-mandalam.[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_206b_copper_plates_at_tirukkalar.html#_ftn9)
A hamlet of it was Korranputtur, identical, perhaps, with the native village of the donee.[\[10\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_206b_copper_plates_at_tirukkalar.html#_ftn10)
Mention is also made in stone inscriptions of the places Mandaragauravamangalam ind Arapadasekharamangalam, which had assemblies similar to that of Arikesarinallur that met together in a common places evidently division in which Sinnamanur was situated. Kottarpolil-Puttur is identical with Tirupputtur in the Ramnad district and is the headquarters of a taluk. From No. 90 of the Madras Epigraphical collection for 1908, we learn that it was situated in Migundaru in Koluvur-kurram, which is the description given of Kottarpolil-puttur in these plates. Pullamangalam is a village in the Papanasam taluk of the Tanjore district. It was situated in Kilar-kurram. Kil-Vemba-nadu is a subdivision of the Pandya country in which Tinnevelly was situated. As scuh, the village of Kura must be looked for near about Tinnevellly.
Surliyaru is the river that takes its rise from the Suruli-malai, 7 miles from Cumbum in the Periyakulam taluk of the Madura district, and flows past Cumbum and Sinnamanur and joins the Vaigai. Anda-nadu is that territorial division of the Pandya country in which Periyakottai in the Dindigul taluk was. Hence Kundur and Korranputtur must be traced out in that locality.
