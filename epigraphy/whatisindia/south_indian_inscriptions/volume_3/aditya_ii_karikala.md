**No. 199.â€” ON A PILLAR IN THE INNER ENCLOSURE OF THE UJJIVA NATHASVAMIN TEMPLE AT UYYAKONDAN-TIRUMALAI**[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn1)

This record of the 2^(nd) year of king Parakesarivarman who took the head of Vira-Pandya, has to be attributed to Aditya (II.) â€” Karikala, whose defeat of the Pandya king while he was yet a boy is mentioned in the Tiruvalangadu plates printed in the sequel. His father Sundarachola-Parantaka II. is already described as having driven a Pandya king into the forest. This must be the early Vira-Pandya whose Vatteluttu inscriptions are found in the Tinnevelly district and in which he claims in his turn to have taken the head of the Chola.
Nandivarma-mangalam was evidently an earlier name of the modern Uyyakkondan Tirumalai and must have been so called after the Pallava king Nandivarman. The temple of Karkudi is mentioned in the hymns of the *Devaram.[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn2)*

(Line 1.) In the 2^(nd) year (*of the reign*) of king Parakesarivarman who took the head of Vira-Pandya, Irungolakkon *alias* Pugalvippiragandan Avanivallan gave ninety sheep which neither die nor grow old for burning one perpetual lamp, as long as the moon and the sun (*last*), to the god Paramesvara (*Siva*) of Tiruk-Karkudi in Nandipanmamangalam, a *brahmadeya* on the southern bank (*of the Kaveri river*).

(LI. 12 â€“ 16.) We, the servants of the god (*devarkanmi*), have received (*these*) ninety (*sheep*) and have agreed to burn the lamp with one *ulakku* of ghee every day, measured by the *ulakku* marked with the trident. This (*gift*) is (*placed under*) the protection of all Mahesvaras*.*

**No. 200.â€” ON THE NORTH WALL OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE IN THE NAGESVARASVAMIN TEMPLE AT KUMBAKONAM**[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn3)

This record, which belongs to the 3^(rd) year of the reign of king Parakesarivarman who took the head of the Pandya, registers a grant of land by purchase by the chief Siringanudaiyan Koyilmayilai *alias* Parantaka Muvendavelan for expounding the system of Prabhakara. This teacher was the founder of a new school of *Mimamsa* philosophy which was greatly popular for some time in the south. The record under review is itself strong evidence of the popularity of the creed. A telugu book called *Sakalarthasagara* makes Prabhakara, one of the pupils of Kumarila-Bhatta. He was also widely known as Prabhakara-guru and was the teacher of Salikanatha. Consequently Prabhakaraâ€™s period must have been about the beginning of the 8^(th) century A.D. See also *Madras Epigraphical Report* for 1912, page 65.

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 3^(rd) year (of thereign) of king Parakesarivarman who took the head of the Pandya (king), we the great men of the *Mulaparadai* (assembly) of Tirukkudamukkil, a *devadana* of Vadagarai Pambur-nadu sold of Sirringanudaiyan Koyilmayilai *alias* Parantaka-Muvendavelan of Sirringan in Inganadu, two *ma* out of the twenty-four *veli* of land which we own as *abhishekadakshina* from the king, in the village of Merkaviri in Innambarnadu as a *bhattavritti*, for expounding *Prabhakaram*.

(L. 10.) (*The following are*) the boundaries (*of this land*). The eastern boundary is to the west of the land sold (*by us*) as *salabhoga*. The southern boundary is to the north of the lands of Markaviri. The western boundary is to the east of the lands of us, the vendors. The northern boundary is to the south of the lands of us, the vendors.

(L. 15.) I, Parantaka Muvendavelan, gave the land thus enclosed by the four big boundaries above specified on the same terms as those that obtained when (*I*) purchased (*it*) from the members of the *mulaparadai* as a *bhattavritti* so as to endure till the moon and the sun.

(L. 19.) This is (*placed*) under the protection of the Almighty god Vishnu.[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn4)
This is the writing of Parantaka.

**No. 201.â€” ON THE SAME WALL**[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn5)

This record is dated in the 4^(th) year of Parakesarivarman who took the head of the Pandya king. The donor was a woman-servant who was living in a quarter of Tanjavur and was connected with queen Udaiyapirattiyar Kilanadigal, mother of Anaimerrunjinar. This name Anaimerrunjinar has been identified with prince Rajaditya, one of the brothers of Aditya-Karikalaâ€™s grandfather Arinjaya (*Madras Epigraphical Report* for 1912, page 62*).*

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 4^(th) year (*of the reign*) of king Parakesarivarman who took the head of the Pandya (*king*), Devayan Pulalakkan *alias* Avanisikhamani, a palace-woman (*living*) in (*the quarter called*) *kilaivelam* of Udaiyapirattiyar Kilanadigal, the mother of Anaimerrunjinar, at Tanjavur in Tanjavur-kurram, gave one lamp-stand for a perpetual lamp to the god Paramesvara (*Siva*) of Tirukkuilkottam at Tirukkudamukkil, a *devadana* in Vadagarai-Pambur-nadu.

(L. 9.) (*She also*) gave ninety sheep for burning this perpetual lamp daily as long as the moon and the sun (*endure*) with one *ulakku* of ghee. The shepherd manran Kunamari of this village received 45 (*out of these ninety*) sheep and receiving (*these*) forty-five agreed to measure out three *nali* and three *ulakku* of ghee for one month at one *alakku* every day and the shepherd Ayalanji Manran of this village received 45 sheep agreeing to measure out for the sacred lamp three *nali* and three *alakku* of ghee for one month at one *alakku* every day.
