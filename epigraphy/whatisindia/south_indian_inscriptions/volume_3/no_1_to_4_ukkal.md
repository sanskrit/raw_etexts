It records that a certain Brahmadhiraja (II. 4 and 11) deposited 200 *kalanju* of gold with the villagers, and that the latter pledged themselves to apply the interest of this sum to the feeding of twelve learned Brahmanas.

(*We*) have received two hundred *kalanju* of gold from Tiruvikrama-Bhattar, *alias* Brahmadhirajar, of Sedi\[ru\]r, (*one*) among the commissioners (*ganattar*) ruling over Uttarameru-chaturvedimangalam,[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_1_to_4_ukkal.html#_ftn2)

We have received these two hundred *kalanju*, in order to supply as long as the moon and the stars exist, to each of these twelve (*brahmanas*), (*one*) *alakku* of ghee, five dishes of curry, five *ulakku* of curds, two areca-nuts, and betel-leaves until they are satisfied, (and) in order to supply everything else to these twelve Brahmans, to the cooks, and to those who fetch firewood.
