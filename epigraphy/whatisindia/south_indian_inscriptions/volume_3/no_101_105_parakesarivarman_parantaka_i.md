The subjoined record refers to two servants of prince Kodanda who must be the same as Kondandarama Rajaditya, the eldest son of Parantaka I[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_101_105_parakesarivarman_parantaka_i.html#_ftn2).
Tirumerrali is the same as Melaikkoyil mentioned in the other records from Kudumiyamalai. Kadugal which forms part of the name of a woman-servant of Rajaditya (1.4) occurs in the Tanjore inscriptions as the name of one of the village goddesses.

Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 15^(th) year of (*the reign of*) king Parakesarivarman who took Madirai (*Madura*), Kudiyan Kadugal of Mangalavasal in Panriyurnadu, who was one of the female (*servants*) (*attached to*) the kitchen (*madaippalli*) of Prince (*pillaiyar*) Kodanda, gave seven and a half *kalanju* of pure gold (*tulaippon*) for one perpetual lamp to (*the temple of)* the lord of the Tirumulattanam (*temple*) at Tirunalakkunram in Kunriyur-nadu. Olai Virttan of Adiyaraiyamangalam in Munaippadi, who supplied (*sandal*) paste[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_101_105_parakesarivarman_parantaka_i.html#_ftn3) to Prince Kodandar, gave 3 (*kalanju*) of pure gold (*tulaippon*) for one lamp to be burnt during day-time (*in the temple*) of the god of Tirumerrali. (*The assembly of*) all Mahesvaras shall protect (*this charity*).

This record which is dated in the 24^(th) year of Parantaka I. registers a gift of land for a lamp by a temple-woman of Jayabhimatali in Tanjavur, in the presence of king Parakesarivarman. Jayabhimatali, as the name of a temple in Tanjore, occurs in one of the inscriptions of the Brihadisvara temple[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_101_105_parakesarivarman_parantaka_i.html#_ftn5) which registers the gift, of service-women of that temple, by Rajaraja I.

Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 24^(th) year of (*the reign of*) king Parakesarivarman, who took Madirai (*Madura*), Nakkan Sandiradevi (*attached to the temple*) of Jayabhimatali at Tanjavur gave in the presence of king Parakesarivarman for burning regularly with (*one*) *ulakku* of oil (*one*) perpetual lamp placed (*by her*) in (*the temple of*) Mahadeva (*Siva*) at Tirukkarugavur, two *ma* of land to the south of the field for sacred lamp granted by Avur â€“ nattu Velarat Vadavur â€“ Vengadu, two *ma* (*of land*) to the west of this (*land*), the mound to the south of *(the* *channel called)* Ulvaykkal and the enclosed field of the mound which has been made cultivable. Receiving all these lands, one perpetual lamp shall be burnt as long as the moon and the sun (*last*). (*The assembly of*) all *Mahesvaras* shall protect this (*charity*).

**No. 103. â€“ ON A SLAB BUILT INTO THE VERANDAH ROUND THE CENTRAL SHRINE OF THE ADHIPURISVARA TEMPLE AT TIRUVORRIYUR**[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_101_105_parakesarivarman_parantaka_i.html#_ftn6)

This record, which is, dated in the 29^(th) year of Parakesarivarman Parantaka I. registers a grant of 30 *kalanju* of pure gold for a lamp to the temple of Mahadeva at Tiruvorriyur. The donor was Iravi Nili, the daughter of the Chera king Vijayaragadeva. From the inscriptions published so far we do not know of any Chera king of name Vijayaraga who was a contemporary of Parantaka. It has been noted above that Kokkandan Sthanu Ravi was a contemporary and friend of Rajakesarivarman Aditya I., father of Parantaka I. Perhaps Vijayaraga (*i.e.,* Vijayaraghava), if at all he was an actual ruler of the Chera country, might have succeeded Sthanu Ravi either as his son or his brother. The friendly relations that thus existed between the Cholas and the Cheras during the reigns of Aditya I and Parantaka I deserve to be noted.

Translation

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! Nili, daughter of the Kerala king Vijayaraga, verily gave thirty *niskha* of pure gold for a lamp to (the temple of) Isana (*Siva*) at Adhipuri.

(L. 3.) In the 29^(th) year of (*the reign of*) king Parakesarivarman, who took Madirai (*Madura*), Iravi Nili, daughter of the Chera king Vijayaragadeva, gave thirty *kalanju* of pure gold tested by the stone of the village (*urkarchemmaipon*), for burning as long as the moon and the starts (*last*), one perpetual lamp in (*the temple of*) Mahadeva (Siva) at Tiruvorriyur. (*In exchange*) for four and a half *kalanju* of gold per year (*which accrues*) as interest on this (*amount of*) gold, (*calculated*) at the rate of three *manadi* of gold on each *kalanju*, the land (*which forms part*) of the field (*called*) Vadagarai Maruderi \[in Tiruvorriyur has been given. The landlordâ€™s share (*svamibhoga)* realized (*from this land*) after deducting (*its*) taxes is granted as permanent *poliyuttu* (*to last*) as long as the moon.

**No. 104.â€” ON THE SAME SLAB**[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_101_105_parakesarivarman_parantaka_i.html#_ftn7)

This is a record of Parantaka I of his 30^(th) year, which mentions a grant by prince (*pillaiyar*) Arindigai or Arindigai â€“ Perumanar, one of the sons of Sola-Perumanadigal (*i.e.* Parantaka I). The Tiruvalangadu plates call this prince Arindama and elsewhere we find the forms Arinjigai, Arimjaya, and Arikulakesariyar. The term *nishka* which occurs in the Sanskrit portion of the grant corresponds to *kalanju* of the Tamil portion, as in No. 103 above. According to Monier Williamsâ€™ *Sanskrit-English Dictionary, nishka* is a coin varying in value at different times; but *kalanju* in Tamil has invariably represented a particular weight of gold bullion (= about 80 grains).

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! The illustrious son of the Chola king, named Arindigai, who possessed keen intelligence, who was the beloved (*of the goddess*) of wealth, who was (*the god of*) death to (his) enemies and whose greatnes was accompanies by virtuous character and god qualities, gave 30 nishkas *of gold by weight to the god, the Conqueror of (the demon*) Pura, who resides in Adhigrama, for a lamp to be burnt always and also gave a big metallic lamp-stand.

(L. 6.) In the 30^(th) year of (the reign of) king Paramesarivarman who took Madirai (*Madura*), prince (*pillaiyar*) Arindigai-Perumanar, the illustrious son of Sola-Perumanadigal (*i.e.,* Parantaka I.) gave to (*the temple of*) Mahadeva (*Siva*) at Tiruvorriyur thirty *kalanju* of pure gold tested by the stone of the village for burning (*one*) perpetual lamp, as long as the moon and the stars (*last*) under the supervision of Sendan . . . . . . . . . . . . . diyappan, a resident of . . . . . . . . . . .Satapattur in Ali â€“ nadu.
