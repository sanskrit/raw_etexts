This inscription is dated in the 4^(th) year of Parakesarivarman and registers the gift of a lamp to the temple of Tirukkil-kottam at Tirukkudamukkil (*i.e.,* the Nagesvara temple at Kumbhakonam).

The date corresponds to Thursday, the 22^(nd) April A.D. 975[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_129_133_uttama_chola.html#_ftn2).

**No. 130.- ON THE NORTH WALL OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE IN THE UMAMAHESVARA TEMPLE AT KONERIRAJAPURAM**[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_129_133_uttama_chola.html#_ftn3)

This inscription is dated in the 6^(th) year of Parakesarivarman Uttama-Chola. It registers the grant of a land for a lamp to the temple of Adityesvaram-Udaiya Mahadeva at Tirunallam.

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 6^(th) year of (*the reign of*) Uttama-Chola *alias* king Parakesarivarman, the headman of Elinur . . . . . . . .. . . . . for burning one perpetual lamp, as long as the moon and the sun (*endure*), to (*the temple of*) Adityesvaramudaiya-Mahadeva at Tirunallam. (*The boundaries of*) the land which I, on behalf of Devan[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_129_133_uttama_chola.html#_ftn4) in presence of the â€˜Karanikasâ€™, (*set boundaries of*) the land which I, on behalf of lands of the god (*are as follow*) : - (*the eastern boundary is*) to the west of the land (*called*) Kulavampandal (*belonging to*) Palasiriyan of Midur ; the southern boundary is to the north of (*the channel called*) Rishabhavahana â€“ vaykkal ; the western boundary is to the east of the land (*belonging to*) Palasiriyan Sattan Kari and (*his*) younger brother and to the channel of the village ; the northern boundary is to the south of the land (*belonging to*) these same (*persons*).

(L. 3.) (*The total extent of*) the land thus (described) (viz.) (*one*) quarter, one-fortieth, one three-hundred and twentieth and 1/320 of three-fourths, one hundred and sixtieth and one hundred and sixtieth[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_129_133_uttama_chola.html#_ftn5).
This land was excluded (*being set apart*) for burning one perpetual lamp as long as the moon and the sun (*endure*). (*The assembly of*) all *Mahesvaras* shall protect this (*charity*). This lamp was given by this person.

**No. 131.- ON THENORTH WALL OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE IN THE NAGESVARASVAMIN TEMPLE AT KUMBAKONAM**[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_129_133_uttama_chola.html#_ftn6)

This is another record of Parakesarivarman which supplies the astronomical details of week-day, month and *nakshatra* and enables us to fix the exact date of the record. Diwan Bahadur Swamikkannu Pillai has calculated and found the details to be correctfor the eighth year of Parakesarivarman Uttama-Chola who ascended the throne in A.D. 969-70.
The date corresponds to Thursday, the 30th January A.D. 979.[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_129_133_uttama_chola.html#_ftn7)
Udaiyar-Gandaradittatterinja-Kaikkolar[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_129_133_uttama_chola.html#_ftn8) must have been the name of a regiment called after king Gandaraditya, the father of Uttama-Chola.

Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 8^(th) year of (the reign of) king Parakesarivarman â€“ in this year â€“ on the day of Avitta (*Sravishtha*) which corresponded to a Thursday in the month of Kumbha of this year . . . . . . . . . . . tan Pichchan *alias* . . .. . . . . . .araiyan . . . . . . . . . . . . Udaiyar \[Gandaradittateri\]nja-Kaikkola . . . . . . . . . . . .. . gave 96 . . . . . . . . . . .for one perpetual sacred lamp to (the temple of) the god (paramasvamin) of Tirukkilkottam at Tirukkudamukkil which was a *devadana* of Pambur-nadu on the northern bank (of the Kaveri). Having received these, the \[shepherd\] Madevan Kari . . . . . . . . .. . devanpuram, shall measure out . . . . . . . . . ghee . . . . . . . . . lamp also. This is placed under the protection of (the assembly of) all *Mahesvaras.*

**No. 132.- ON THE NORTH BASE OF THE SECOND PILLAR IN THE ROCK-CUT CAVE IN THE PUNDARIKAKSHA-PERUMAL TEMPLE AT TIRUVELLARAI**[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_129_133_uttama_chola.html#_ftn9)

This unfinished inscription is dated in the 8^(th) year of Parakesarivarman and registers a gift of \[2\]0 *kalanju* of gold for offerings to the god Krishna and his consort Rukmini. The donor was Irayirandevi-Ammanar, the wife of â€˜the lord who died on the back of an elephantâ€™.

This is the earliest reference in *South-Indian Inscriptions* to the worship of Krishna and Rukmini. By the clause â€˜the lord who died on the back of an elephantâ€™ we have probably to understand Prince Rajaditya who, in the large Leyden grant, is stated to have met with his death on the back of an elephant in an encounter with Krishnaraja (*i.e.,* The Rashtrakuta king Krishna III.)[\[10\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_129_133_uttama_chola.html#_ftn10)
King Parakesarivarman must, therefore, be identified with either Mddhurantaka Uttama-Chola or with Aditya-Karikala II.

Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 8^(th) year of (*the reign of*) king Parakesarivarman, (*the following*) was engraved (i.e., *recorded*) as the gift (*made*) by Irayirandevi-Ammanar, the consort of â€˜the lord who died on the back of an elephantâ€™ (*Udaiyar Anaimerrunjinar*) to the glorious (*god*) Krishna and the glorious goddess Rukmini in the sacred big temple (periya-srikoyil) at Tiruvellarai. \[Twenty\] *kalanju* of gold (*weighed*) by the stone (*called after*) Tiruvellarai, were deposited for offering food prepared from four *nali* of rice to the glorious (*gold*) Krishna on each one of the (*following*) days (*viz*.,) the two *vavu* (?), Ashtami (*eighth tithi) and* Sankranti. And for one lamp, deposited . . . . . . . .. . . . . . gold (weighed) by the stone (*called after*) Tiruvellarai.
