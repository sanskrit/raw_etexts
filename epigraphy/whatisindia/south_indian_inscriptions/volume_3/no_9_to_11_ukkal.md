This interest record contains an order which Rajaraja I issued at (his capital) Tanjavur on the 124^(th) day of the 24^(th) year of his reign, and which was engrossed on the 143^(rd) day of the same year. This order deals with defaulters of land revenue in villages held by Brahmanas, Vaikhanasas and Jainas in the Chola, Tondai and Pandya country. The villagers were authorized to confiscate and sell the land on which no taxes had been paid for two full years.

The royal order was written by the secretary Rajakesarinallur Kilavan, or, as he is called in two of the Tanjavur inscriptions, Karayil Eduttapadam.[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_9_to_11_ukkal.html#_ftn1)
It was signed by the chief secretary Mummudi-Chola-Brahmamaharaja, and by Mummudi-Chola-Bhoja. These two officers are mentioned in the large Leyden grant[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_9_to_11_ukkal.html#_ftn2) and in inscriptions of the Tanjore temple.[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_9_to_11_ukkal.html#_ftn3)
Their original names were Krishna Rama and Irayiravan Pallavayan.
During the reign of Rajaraja I. they bore the titles Mummudi-Chola-Brahmamaharaja and Mummudi-Chola-Bhoja, which are derived from Mummudi-Chola, a surname of Rajaraja I. After the accession of Rajendra-Chola I they received the additional titles Rajendra-Chola-Brahmamaharaja and Uttama-Chola-Pallavaraiyan.

(Line 1.) Hail! Prosperity! On the 124^(th) day of the 24h year (*of the reign*) of the glorious king Rajaraja-Kesarivarman, *alias* Sri-Rajarajadeva, who, (*in*) his life of growing strength, during which,- (*in*) the belief, that, as well as the goddess of fortune, the goddess of the great earth had become his wife,- he was pleased to destroy the ships (*at*) Kandalur-Salai, and conquered by (*his*) army, which was victorious in great battles, Vengai-nadu, Ganga-padi, Nulamba-padi, Tadigai-padi, Kudamalai-nadu, Killam, Kalingam, Ila-mandalam, (*the conquest of which*) made (*him*) famous (*in*) the eight directions, and the seven and a half *lakshas* of Ilatta-padi, - deprived the Selinas of (*their*) splendour at the very moment when Udagai, which is worshipped everywhere, was (most) resplendent ; - the lord Sri-Rajarajadeva, being graciously seated in the college (kalluri)[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_9_to_11_ukkal.html#_ftn4) on the south of the painted hall (*chitra-kuta*) at the great hippodrome gate (periya-sendu-vayil) in Tanjavur, was pleased to order as follows :
