This inscription which is dated in the 15^(th) year of Parakesarivarman Uttama-Chola mentions Senni-Yeripadaichcholan Uttamasolan who was probably an officer of the king. The first part of the name suggests that this chief would have been connected with *Senni-yeri-padai, i.e.,* the warlike army of Senni.

Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 15^(th) year of (*the reign of*) king Parakesarivarman the glorious Uttama-Choladeva, Uttama-Chola having been pleased to order to make and present in gold to (*the* *temple of*) Mahadeva at Tiruvorriyur, (*an image of*) Sribalideva, eight trumpets, and fly-whisks for thetwenty-four fly-whisk-women from the taxes of the king, (*these*) were made and presented (*by*) Senni-Yeripadaichcholan Uttamasolan . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. .

**No. 144.- ON THE SOUTH WALL OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE IN THE APATSAHAYESVARATEMPLE AT ADUTURAI**[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_143_147_uttama_chola.html#_ftn2)

The inscription is dated in the 16^(th) year of king Parakesarivarman alias Madhurantakadeva Uttama-Chola and states that the temple of Tirukkurangaduturai (i.e., the modern Aduturai near Tiruvidaimarudur) was built of stone by the kingâ€™s mother Udaiyapirattiyar Madevadigalar *alias* Sembiyanmadeviyar and that certain documents of grants made to the god in former times having become old and damaged were now re-engraved on the walls of the newly-constructed temple.

The temple of Tirukkurangaduturai is already mentioned in the *Devaram* and as such it should have been in existence to the construction of it in stone by the kingâ€™s mother there was, perhaps, a smaller stone structure[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_143_147_uttama_chola.html#_ftn3) with inscriptions (*laksanha*) on it. Consequently what is recorded here must refer to the renovation of the temple by the queen mother. In this connexion it may be noted that two inscriptions of the Pandya king Maranjadaiyan[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_143_147_uttama_chola.html#_ftn4) which are earlier in point of time than the present record and are also found on the temple walls, must have been copies of older grants.

Hail ! Prosperity ! In this sacred stone temple which Udaiyapirattiyar Madevadigalar *alias* the glorious Sembiyan-Madeviyar who had obtained in her sacred womb the glorious Madhurantakadeva *alias* the glorious Uttama-Chola â€“ had graciously caused to be built to the god (*alvar*) at Tirukkurangaduturai in Tiraimur-nadu, were engraved on stone, in the 16^(th) year of (*the reign*) the glorious Uttama-Choladeva *alias* king Parakesarivarman (*such*) *lakshanas* (*i.e., inscriptions ?)* as were made to this god in former times (*to last*) as long as the moon and the sun, and which *lakshanas* on examination were found to have become old.

**No. 145.- ON A PILLAR LYING TO THE SOUTH OF THE TANK IN FRONT OF THE ADHIPURISVARA TEMPLE AT TIRUVORRIYUR**[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_143_147_uttama_chola.html#_ftn5)

This inscription is dated in the 16^(th) year of Parakesarivarman Uttama-Chola. It refers to a scrutiny of accounts of the temple of Tiruvorriyur made in this year and registers the assignment of a gold salver to the temple at the headman of Elinur in Purangarambai-nadu.
The district in which Purangarambai-nadu was situated is not given ; but we know from other records that it was in Arumolideva-valanadu also called Ten Kaduvay[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_143_147_uttama_chola.html#_ftn6).
The village of Elinur mentioned in the record may be identified with Elalur in the Tirutturaippundi taluk of the Tanjore district.

Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 16^(th) year of (*the reign of*) the gloriousUttama-Choladeva *alias* king Parakesarivarman, Nandisuran *alias* Parakesari-Vilupparaiyan, the headman of Elinur, (*a village*) in Purangarambia-nadu (*which was a subdivision*) of Sola-nadu, who scrutinizes the sacred business of the god (*alvar*) at Tiruvorriyur, assigned, after adding up the kingâ€™s income, one gold salver with pits, weighing eight hundred and eighty-eight *kalanju* marked and pure (*as tested by*) the stone (*weight*) of the treasury (*pandarakkal*), for offering food to the god, as long as the moon and the sun (*endure*). In this (*are included*) the forty *kalanju* marked and pure (*as tested by*) the stone (*weight*) of the treasury (*pandarakkal*), for offering food to the god, as long as the moon and sun (*endure*). In this (*are included*) the forty *kalanju* of marked and pure gold deposited by Siyan Puravariniranjanan, (*one of the*) Valanjiyar, for offering two dishes of superior food (*uttamagram*), (*in order to secure merit*) for Kalan[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_143_147_uttama_chola.html#_ftn7) and Manikkasetti.

**No. 146.- ON THE SOUTH WALL OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE IN THE UMAMAHESVARA TEMPLE AT KONERIRAJAPURAM**[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_143_147_uttama_chola.html#_ftn8)

This inscription is engraved below a group of sculptures reproduced on the accompanying plate. It states that, during the reign of Madhurantakadeva *alias* Uttama-Chola, his mother Madevadigalar *alias* Sembiyan-Madeviyar caused to be built in the name of her husband Gandaradityadeva, a stone temple at Tirunallam, *i.e.,* the modern Konderirajapuram, which is one of the ancient Saivite places of worship mentioned in the *Devaram*. The inscription serves as a key to understand the sculptures below which it is engraved. The female figure kneeling down in a worshipping posture is queen Sembiyan Madeviyar and the one close to the *linga* is Gandaradityadeva. The two figures behind the queen are her attendants. The name Adityesvara-Mahadeva which occurs in other inscriptions of Konerirajapuram indicates that it was derived from Gandaraditya.

Hail ! Prosperity ! Madevadigalar *alias* the glorious Sembiyan-Madeviyar, queen of Gandaradityadeva, constructed in the sacred name of her husband (*viz*.,) the glorious Gandaradityadeva, a stone temple to the lord (*i.e., the god*) of Tirunallam (*at the time*) when her illustrious son, *i.e.,* the glorious Madhurantakadeva *alias* the glorious Uttama-Chola, was graciously ruling. This is (*the image of)* the glorious Gandaradityadeva which was (*caused to be*) made in this sacred stone temple in the posture of worshipping the sacred feet of the lord (i.e., *the god*) of Tirunallam.
