**No. 75.- Inscription at Tirukkalukkunram**

This inscription (No. 179 of 1894) is engraved on the south wall of the second *prakara* of the Vedagirisvara temple at Tirukkalukkunram.[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_75_to_76_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn1)
It has been published before in a tentative manner by Mr. V. Kanakasabhai Pillai in the *Indian Antiquary*, Vol. XXI. P. 281 ff.[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_75_to_76_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn2)
The date is the 42^(nd) year of the reign of Kulottunga I. (1. 11).

The inscription records that an inhabitant of Rajarajapuram (1. 17) made over 10 *kasu* (1. 14) to the temple authorities, who purchased for this sum from the villagers of Vanavanmahadevi-chaturvedimangalam (1. 11) some land for maintaining the *Matha* of Naminandi-Adigal at Tirukkalukkunram (1. 14). As stated by Mr. Kanakasabhai,[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_75_to_76_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn3) the person after whom this *Matha* was named is one of the sixty-three devotees of Siva, whose lives are described in the *Periyapuranam*.

Vanavanmahadevi-chaturvedimangalam belonged to Kumili-nadu, a subdivision of the district of Amur-kottam (1. 11). The land purchased was situated in Kiraippakkam, a hamlet in the west of that village (1. 12), and was bounded in the east by Urodagam, in the south by Talaivedu, in the west by Uragambakkam, and in the north by Tandurai (1. 13).
Kiraippakkam is the modern Kirappakkam[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_75_to_76_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn4) in the Chingleput taluka. East of it the map shows Oragadam (No. 228), south of it Talambedu (No. 266), and north of it Tandarai (No. 233).
The *nadu* to which these villages belonged is named after Kumili[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_75_to_76_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn5) in the same taluka. The district of Amur-kottam owes its name to the village of Amur[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_75_to_76_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn6) near Mamallapuram,[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_75_to_76_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn7) which belonged to the subdivision Amur-nadu.[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_75_to_76_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn8)
From the Kondyata grant of Venkata II.[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_75_to_76_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn9) it appears that there was another district which also bore the name of Amur-kottam, but which was named after the town of Amur or Ambur in the Velur taluka of the North Arcot district.[\[10\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_75_to_76_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn10)

**No. 76.- Inscription in the Jambukesvara Temple**

This inscription (No. 31 of 1891) is engraved on the east wall of the second *prakara* of the Jambukesvara temple[\[25\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_75_to_76_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn25) on the island of Srirangam near Trichinopoly.

The date is the 47^(th) year of the reign of Kulottunga I. A certain Villavarayan had set up in the temple images of Rishabhavahana, *i.e.,* Siva riding on the bull, and of Parvati. To provide for the requirements of these two images, he purchased from the temples authorities some land, whose crop of paddy had to be made over to the temple.
