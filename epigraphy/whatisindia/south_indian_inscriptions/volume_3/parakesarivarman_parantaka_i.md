**No. 95.â€” ON THE SOUTH WALL OF THE MANDAPA IN FRONT OF THE ABHIRAMESVARA SHRINE AT TIRUVAMATTUR.**

This inscription is dated in the 3^(rd) year of Parakesarivarman and registers a gift of gold by a certain Gandaraitta Pallavaraiyan to the temple at Tiruvamattur, which was a *devadana* in Mivali-Vavalur-nadu, a subdivision of Aruvanadu Gandaraditta Pallavaraiyan was evidently an officer of Gandaraditya who is known from copper-plate records to have been the second son of king Parantaka I. Parakesarivarman of this record may have, therefore, to be identified with Parantaka I.

Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 3^(rd) year of (*the reign of*) king Parakesarivarman, Parabumigan Mallan *alias* Gandaraditta Pallavaraiayn, the chief of Karpundinadu in Mutta-nadu deposited ten gold (pon) (*coins*) for burning as long as the moon and the sun (*endure*) one perpetual lamp which (*he*) had placed in (*the temple of*) the lord of Tiruvamattur (*which was*) a devadana in Mivali-Vavalur-nadu (*a subdivision*) of Aruva-nadu. The (*members of the*) assembly, the villagers (*ur*) and the temple servants (*devarkanmi*) shall protect this gold paid (*by the donor*). (*The assembly of*) all Mahesvaras shall protect (*this charity*).

**No. 96. â€“ ON THE SOUTH WALL OF THE MANDAPA IN FRONT OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE IN THE CHANDRASEKHARA TEMPLE AT TIRUCHCHENDRUAI.**[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/parakesarivarman_parantaka_i.html#_ftn1)

In this inscription which is dated in the 3^(rd) year of Paakesarivarman, we have a reference to the construction of the Siva temple at Tiruchchendurai which was a *brahmadeya* suburb of Isanamagala, by Pudi Adichchapidariyar (Adityapidari). This lady is here distinctly called the daughter of Tennavan Ilangovelar (*another name of MaravanPudiyar*)[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/parakesarivarman_parantaka_i.html#_ftn2) and the queen of Arikulakesariyar, the son of Sola-Perumanadigal (*i.e.,* Parantaka I.). Consequently, Parakesarivarman to whose reign the record belongs is Parantaka I. It may be noted that the 60 *kalanju* of gold granted by Pudi Adichchapidari for sacred offerings to the god, was weighed by a stone called after Vedelvidugu which was the surname of the Pallava king Tellarrerinda Nandippottaraiyar.

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 3^(rd) year of (*the reign of*) king Parakesarivarman, Pudi Adichchapidariyar, daughter of Tennavan Ilangovelar (*and*) queen of Arikulakesariyar *(who was*) the son of Sola-Perumanadigal (*i.e.,* Parantaka I.), gave, in this year, sixty *kalanju* of (*pure gold called*) *tulaippon[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/parakesarivarman_parantaka_i.html#_ftn3)*
(*weighed*) by the (*standard*) stone Vedelvidugu,[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/parakesarivarman_parantaka_i.html#_ftn4) as capital (*from which*) sacred offerings at the holy shrine (*sennadai*) (*have to be provided*) to the lord of the stone temple constructed by her at Tiruchchendurai, (*a hamlet*) of Isanamangala which was a *brahmadeya*.

(L. 7.) And we, (the members of) the assembly (*parudai*) of Isanamangala, having received this sixty *kalanju* of gold, we (the members of) the assembly agreed to measure out as long as the moon and the sun *(endure*), sixty *kalam* of paddy per year (*measured*) by the *sulakkal, viz.,* thirty *kalam* at the end of *Karttigai* and thirty *kalam* in the harvest (*pisanam*) at the end of Panguni â€“ in all sixty *kalam* of paddy â€“ as interest of this gold (*calculated*) at (*the rate of*) (one) *tuni* and (*one*) padukku of paddy on (*one*) *kalanju* for (*each*) pu (*crop*).

(L. 12.) One *kuruni* of old rice pounded ten or eight times shall be (*used each day*) for (*providing)* sacred offerings at the dawn (*nal*) and in the mid-day (*uchcham*). (*The assembly of*) all *Mahesvaras* shall protect this (*charity*).

**No. 97. â€“ ON A ROCK TO THE LEFT OF THE PAINTED CAVE AT TIRUMALAI NEAR POLUR.**[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/parakesarivarman_parantaka_i.html#_ftn5)

This inscription records that in the 4^(th) year of Parakesarivarman, two residents of Kaduttalai in the country called Irumadichcholar Kannadaga (Karnataka), gave four *kalanju* of gold for feeding a devotee in the Jain temple on the hill at Vaigavur in Pangala-nadu which was a subdivision of Palakunrakottam. The name Irumadichcholar Kannadaga indicates that the country in which Vaigavur was situated, was so called after Irumadichchola who is perhaps to be identified with parakesarivarman in whose reign the record is dated. Irumadichchola means â€˜the twice (*powerful*) Cholaâ€™. Parakesarivarman Parantaka I. was actually the second powerful king in the Vijayalaya line.

Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 4^(th) year of (*the reign of*) king Parakesarivarman, we the two following persons (*viz*.) Eran Puttugan, a temple servant (*devakanmi*) of the village of Kaduttalai in Irumadichcholar â€“ Kannadaga (*country*) and Madurantaka Karambular *alias* Somanayagan Sandaiyan Ayiravan of Kaduttalai, provided to give food regularly[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/parakesarivarman_parantaka_i.html#_ftn6) to one devotee (*adigal*) in the Jaina temple (*palli*) on the sacred hill (*tirumalai*) at Vaigavur (*a village*) in Pangala-nadu (*which was a district*) of Palakunra-kottam. We deposited for this (*purpose*) four *kalanju* of gold to last as long as the moon and the sun endure, so that, with the interest accruing (*from this gold*), the managers of this *palli* shall themselves feed (*thedevotee*).

[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/parakesarivarman_parantaka_i.html#_ftnref3) Tulaippon or tulainiraippon, sometimes also preceded by the name of the stone on which it was tested or by which it was weighed, was apparently a term for pure gold. This is explained by the passage suttu vetti sudukku thanthu kasattri kaisellvadu kazhasirpertha thulaipon uraiyum thulaiyum vazhuvathathu . . . . . . . nagarakallal . . . . . . pon, *i.e.,* the gold thulaipon which was heated, cut, melted (?), cooled after melting and made current, cut off from the *kalanju*, which was neither wanting in fineness nor in *tulai* (impression ?) and which was tested or weighed by the city stone.â€? It occurs in a record of Rajaraja I. (No. 218 of 1911). It was evidently a practice to allow the currency of gold in any transaction only after putting it to test by special officers appointed for the purpose. It may therefore be presumed that *tulaippon* represented gold that had passed through this test. It is not unlikely also that an impression was always left on such gold as a hall-mark.

The correct form of this word is Videlvidugu which is the surname of Tellarrerinda Nandippottaraiyar.

In *South-Indian Inscriptions* (e.g., Vol. III, Part II, p.146) this word is translated as â€˜daily.â€™ It is doubtful if *nisadam*, which also sometimes  
occurs as *nisadi*, is to be taken as a Tamil corruption of the Sanskrit niyata or if it is only another form of *nichcham* (skt. nitya).
