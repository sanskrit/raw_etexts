**No. 61.- On the wall to the north of the tank in the Bilvanathesvara temple**

This inscription is dated in the 11^(th) year of the reign of Kulottunga-Choladeva (II.)[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_61_to_63_tiruvallam.html#_ftn1) and records that certain income was assigned to the temple by the same Sengeni chief who is mentioned in No. 132 of Vol. I.

(Line 1.) In the 11^(th) year (*of the reign*) of the emperor of the three worlds, Sri-Konerimelkonda-Kulottunga-Soladeva,[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_61_to_63_tiruvallam.html#_ftn2) - I, Sengeni Ammaiappan Kannudaipperuman,[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_61_to_63_tiruvallam.html#_ftn3) *alias* Vikrama-Sola-Sambuvarayan, gave to the god the internal revenue of the temple of the lord Tiruvallam-udaiyar, the taxes in paddy and the taxes in money accruing from the external revenue due from (*the fields called*) *Vadakandam* and *Kamugadi*, the tax on looms,[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_61_to_63_tiruvallam.html#_ftn4) the tax on *Ajivikas*,[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_61_to_63_tiruvallam.html#_ftn5) all the renue of Tikkali-Vallam, the minor taxes[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_61_to_63_tiruvallam.html#_ftn6) and (*the fines called*) *kurram* and *danda,* including the share of the village accountant and the share and tax of the temple accountant.

(L. 8.) He who obstructs this charity, shall incur the sin of killing a tawny cow between the Ganga and Kumari.

(L. 10.) The feet of him who protects this charity (*shall be*) on my head.

**No. 62.- On the North wall of Mahamandapa in the Bilvanathesvara temple**

This inscription is dated in the \[3\]4^(th) year of the reign of Kulottunga-Choladeva and records the gift of two lamps by Ariyapillai,[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_61_to_63_tiruvallam.html#_ftn7) the queen of Amarabharana-Siya-ganga. An inscription in the
Ekamranatha temple at Kanchipuram (No. 10 of 1893) mentions the same chief as â€œthe supreme lord of Kuvalalapura (*i.e.,* Kolar), he who was born from the Ganga family, Siyagangan Amarabharanan, *alias* Tiruvegambamudaiyan,â€? and is dated in the 27^(th) year of the reign of Kulottunga-Chola III.

According to its preface, the famous Tamil Grammar *Nannul* was composed by Pavanandi (*i.e.,* *Bhavanandin*) at the orer of Siyagangan Amarabharanan. The Ekamranatha inscription proves that Bhavanandinâ€™s patron was a vassal of Kulottunga III.

Hail ! Prosperity ! In the \[3\]4^(th) year (*of the reign*) of Kulottunga-Soladeva, Ariyapillai, who was the consort of Amarabharana-Siyaganga, gave to the god of Tiruvallam one twilight lamp and gave to the goddess on (*other*) twilight lamp. To these two lamps. . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

**No. 63.- On the west wall of the kitchen in the Bilvanathesvara temple**

The subjoined inscription records a remission of taxes by Alagiya-Pallavan. This chief bore the same surname as Alagiya-Sola, a feudatory of Rajaraja III.,[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_61_to_63_tiruvallam.html#_ftn8) and accordingly seems to have been a member of the Sengeni family.[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_61_to_63_tiruvallam.html#_ftn9)
The inscription refers to the 3^(rd) year of the reign of Vijaya-Gandagopaladeva. Three inscriptions at Kanchipuram are dated in the Saka year 1187 and in the 15^(th) and 16^(th) years of *Tribhuvanachakravartin* Vijaya-Gandagopaladeva,[\[10\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_61_to_63_tiruvallam.html#_ftn10) who is perhaps identical with the former king.

Hail ! Prosperity ! We, Alagiya-Pallavan Edirili-Sola-Sambuvarayan, have ordered that, from the third year (*of the reign*) of Vijaya-Gandagopaladeva, if taxes and revenue due to us are levied, (*these*) taxes and revenue have to be levied after remission of one sixteenth and one fifth, to the extent of the full amount which had not been (*levied*) in former times.
