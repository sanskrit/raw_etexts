**No. 40.- On the outside of the east wall of the inner Prakara of the Rajagopala-Perumal Temple**

This inscription consists of a single Sanskrit verse in the *Indravajra* metre and of a passage in Tamil prose. It is dated on a week-day (1. 3) which will probably admit of calculation, in the 18^(th) year of the reign of *Tribhuvanachakravartin* Rajarajadeva, and records the gift of two lamps to the image of Vishnu, and to an image of Narasimha which was set up in the same temple.

Hail ! Prosperity ! (Verse 1.) Srikrishna-Suri, a treasury of the scriptures (*Agama*), the full-moon of the ocean (*which is*) the Vadhula-gotra, gave a pair of lamps to the highest primal being (*Vishnu*) who resides at Ratnagrahara.[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_40_to_41_manimangalam.html#_ftn1)

(Line 2.) In the 18^(th) year (*of the reign*) of the emperor of the three worlds, the glorious Rajarajadeva, on the day of *Sravana*, which correspond to a Monday and to the first tithi of the first fortnight of the month of *Makara*, - we two, Srirama-Bhattan, who performs the worship in the temple of Mannanar (*Vishnu*) at Manimangalam, *alias* Gramasikhamani-chaturvedimangalam, and his younger brother Virrirundan Bhattan, received two *kalanju* of pure gold from Srikrishna-Bhattan,[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_40_to_41_manimangalam.html#_ftn2)
who performs the worship in the temple of Mannanar (*Vishnu*) at Manimangalam, *alias* Gramasikhamani-chaturvedimangalam, and his younger brother Virrirundan Bhattan, received two *kalanju* of pure gold from Srikrihsna-Bhatta[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_40_to_41_manimangalam.html#_ftn3) . . . . . . . . . . .. .. . . of Kundur, (*a resident*) of this village.

(L. 6.) We two have caused to be engraved on stone that, (*in return*) for these two *kalanju* of pure gold, we shall have to burn, as long as the moon and the sun exist, one sacred lamp in the morning before the god Mannanar, and one sacred lamp in the evening before the god Singa-Perumal who is pleased to reside in the same temple.

**No. 41.- On the east wall of the Dharmesvara temple**

Like No. 40, this inscription is dated on a week-day which will probably admit of calculation, in the 18^(th) year of the reign of *Tribhuvanachakravartin* Rajarajadeva. It records that the same two brothers, who are mentioned in No. 39 above, paid to the authorities of the Dharmesvaa temple two *kalanju* of gold, from the interest of which the cost of feeding two lamps had to be defrayed.

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! With the approval of the god, - in the 18^(th) year (of the reign) of the emperor of the three worlds, Sri-Rajarajadeva, on the day of *Revati*, which corresponded to a Tuesday and to the second *tithi* of the second fortnight of the month of *Simha, -* we, all the holders of the land (kani) of the *Siva-Brahmanas* of the temple of the lord Tanmisvara at Manimangalam, *alias* Gramasikhamani-chaturvedimangalam, in Kunrattur-nadu, (a subdivision) of Puliyur-kottam, *alias* Kulottunga-Sola-valanadu, (a district) of Jayankonda-Sola-mandalam, (*viz.,*) *Gautaman* Ambalakkutta-Bhattan, *Kasyappan* Gangadhara-Bhattan, and the partners[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_40_to_41_manimangalam.html#_ftn4) of *Kasyapan* Truchchirrambala-Bhattan, received on interest from Brahmapriyan, the eldest son of Panchanadi Lakshmanan Malaiginiyaninran, the accountant of this village, and his younger brother Ahavamalladevan 2 *kalanju* of pure gold (under the condition) that we should burn at early dawn from this day two sacred lamps which (those two persons) had given (to the temple).

(L. 8.) We, all these persons, caused to be engraved on stone that, having received these two *kalanju* of gold, we shall be bound to burn (those two lamps) as long as the moon and the sun exist.

(L. 9.) This was written under order by Manimangalam-udaiyan Alumbiran.
