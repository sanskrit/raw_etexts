**No. 128.- MADRAS MUSEUM PLATES OF UTTAMA-CHOLA**

These copper-plates belong to the Madras Museum. A full description of them together with that of the huge ring and seal on which they are hung and a short abstract of contents, have been given by Professor Hultzsch in his *Report on Epigraphy* for the half-year ending March 1891, page 4, paragraph 9[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_128_uttama_chola.html#_ftn1). The plates are published below for the first time with text and translation. Mr. Sewell does not mention them in the list of copper-plate grants which he gives at the beginning of his *Lists of Madras* Antiquities, Volume II. It cannot be ascertained how and when the plates were acquired by the Museum.

Early Chola copper-plate grants published so far are only two in number. These are known as the large and the small Leyden grants which belong to the time of Rajendra-Chola I. Hence the subjoined plates which bear on them the record of Parakesarivarman Uttama-Choladeva, the uncle of Rajaraja I., and the grandfather of Rajendra-Chola I., will be the earliest Chola record[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_128_uttama_chola.html#_ftn2) published.

A few plates of the set are missing at the beginning and one at least at the end. The portion of the record on the existing five copper-plates consists of a short Sanskrit prose passage (II. 1 to 6), three Sanskrit verse (II. 6 to 11) the Tamil prose (II. 11 to 121). The construction of the Tamil portion is often involved and irregular[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_128_uttama_chola.html#_ftn3).
The word *near* in 1. 87, *e.g.,* is used in the still current commercial sense of adjustment of receipts and payments and the meaning of *visam* in 1. 111 is not quite intelligible[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_128_uttama_chola.html#_ftn4)
As regards the palaeography and orthography of the plates the following may be noted. The initial vowels *e* and *e* are not distinguished, though in other inscriptions of this period the distinction is marked by adding the sign of length (kaal) to the short *e.* This method of distinguishing the long from the short is however observed in *o*, in II. 52 and 53. The secondary *i* and *i* signs are distinguished, the latter by a loop attached to the end of the semi-circular cap which represents the former, *e.g.,* *ni* and *vi* in II. 22 and 23 respectively. The *I* super-added to *da* or *ta* is, as usual, marked by the semi-circular cap; but in certain cases as in II. 26, 34, *etc.,* it is shown by the head of the letter itself being bent and drawn out almost into a loop. The vowel signs *u* and *u* added to *m* are distinguished, the former by a plain curve bent towards the left and attached to the prolonged vertical of *ma* from its middle and the latter by the same curve doubled like the English numeral 3. The same remarks apply as well to *lu* and *lu*. When added to *ka* and *u* and *u* signs are doubled in either case, the distinction, however, being that in the former the curve bends to the left and in the latter to the right. In *ya, va* and *pa* these signs are marked as at present by a vertical line attached to the right limb of the letter in the one case, and by a curve affixed to the latter, in the other. In the case of letters, na, na, la and nya the *u*-sign is detached kaal-symbol which at present however is joined to the *u-*sign of the letter. *Sandhi*
(punarchchi) is but optionally adopted. The doubling of consonants has been omitted evidently by mistake in II. 68, 70, 71, *etc.,* Case terminations are added to the last word of a group (*e.g.,* II. 16f, 82). In I. 44 Anjukalanju is written for Ain-kalanju. The forms nisadam and nisada both occur. So also the forms Ugachchegal, Uvachchergal, and Uvachar (II. 54, 64, 86).

The Sanskrit portion states that 200 pieces of gold were deposited with two classes of *pattasalins* residing in the quarters (of Kachchippedu) known as Karuvulan-pati, Kamasahappati, Atimanappati and Erruvalichcheri and that the residents of two of the above-said quarters were appointed managers of the temple by the king (Uttama-Chola). Also this same Chola king â€˜who destroyed Madhuraâ€™ is stated to have ordered that the residents of Solaniyamam, another quarter of Kachchippedu, should give to the god at Uraka two *prastha* and one *kudubaka* of rice and one *prastha* of oil and thus be exempted from all other taxes payable to the king. These residents of Solaniyamam together with the managers appointed from among the weavers who made cloths for a king and lived in the four quarters mentioned above, were further required to write out by turns the accounts of the temple of Vishnu at Uragam.

The Tamil portion which begins in line 11 is dated in the 16^(th) year of Parakesarivarman *alias* Uttama-Choladeva and records that while the king was seated in the Chitra-*mandapa* inside his palace (*koyil*) at Kachchippedu, his officer Solamuvendavelar whose name was Nakkan Kanichchan of Sikkal (1. 25 f.) requested that the income of the god of the temple of Uragam which consisted of (1) *kolniraikuli* and *kalalavu-kuli* collected at Kachchippedu, (2) of the (produce) from) lands purchased at Kachchippedu and Tundunukkachcheri and (3) on interest (in paddy and in money) accruing on investments by the temple, might be apportioned for the several services in the main temple and in the two shrines of the hall called Karikalaterri(I. 65) and that the residents of the two quarters of Kachchippedu, *viz.,* Kambulanpadi and Atimanappadi (1. 23) may be appointed to supervise and carry out this apportionment. The king entrusted the matter in the hands of the chief who made the request and the latter settled the required apportionment of income.

The lands purchased and the investments made are detailed with reference to the original documents written on stone. These were : - (1) document dated in the 22^(nd) year of king Parakesarivarman, by which the assemblies of Kuram and Ariyar-Perumbakkam having received 250 *kalanju* of gold from the temple had agreed to measure every year as interest thereon 500 *kadi* of paddy ; (2) document dated in the same year by which the assembly of Ulai-ur received 50 *kalanju* and agreed to measure annually an interest thereon of 150 *kadi* of paddy ; (3) document dated in the 9^(th) year of king Vijaya-Kampavarman, by which the assembly of Olukkaippakkam received 24 *kalanju* and agreed to pay an interest every year of one *kalanju* and four *manjadi* of gold.

With line 72 commences a fresh grant made in the 16^(th) year of Parakesarivarman (Uttama-Chola), to the temple of Uragam at Kachchippedu for maintaining the *Sittirai-tiruvila* festival of that god. For this purpose 200 *kalanju* of gold were deposited with the residents of Kambulanpadi, Atimanappadi, Kanjagappadi and Erruvalichcheri on perpetual interest of 30 *kalanju* for one year, at the rate of one *pilavu* on each *kalanju* per month. This money (i.e., 30 *kalanju*) being fully adjusted (ner) for expenses detailed in lines 81 to 89, the lamp-holders for the festival and the flag-hoisters had to be secured by the residents of the four quarters mentioned above (*free of cost*).
