**I.- Inscriptions in the Vishnu temple at Ukkal**

No. 5 to 8 south wall of the same shrine

[*No. 1 to 4 north & west wall of the same shrine*](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_1_to_4_ukkal.html)

[*No. 9 to 11 north wall of the mandapa*](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_9_to_11_ukkal.html)

[*No. 12 to 14 west & south wall of the same mandapa*](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_12_to_14_ukkal.html)

**No. 5.- On the south wall of the shrine**

This inscription is dated in the 15^(th) year of the reign of Kampavarman. The archaic alphabet employed in this record and in No. 8 below, which is dated in the 10^(th) year of the same king, proves that Kampavarman must be anterior to the Chola occupation of Tondai-mandalam. A stone inscription of the 9^(th) year of the same king is quoted in the unpublished Madras Museum plates of Parakesarivarman, *alias*
Uttama-Choladeva.[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_5_to_8_ukkal.html#_ftn1)
The temple of Virrirunda-Perumal at Dusi near Mamandur in the Arcot taluka contains a fragmentary inscription of a king named *ko vijaya*-kampa-Vikramavarman.[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_5_to_8_ukkal.html#_ftn2)
The fact that the two words *ko vijaya* are prefixed to the name of this king, suggests that he belonged to the same family as *ko vijaya*-Narasimhavarman, Nripatunga-Vikramavarman and Nandi-Vikramavarman.[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_5_to_8_ukkal.html#_ftn3)
A later kampa was the second of the five sons of Samgama I., the founder of the first Vijayanagara dynasty.[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_5_to_8_ukkal.html#_ftn4)

The inscription records that a certain Sadaiyan made over 1,000 *kadi[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_5_to_8_ukkal.html#_ftn5)* of paddy to the villagers of Utkar, who pledged themselves to supply in return 500 *kadi* of paddy per year for some unspecified purpose.

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! In the fifteenth year (*of the reign*) of Kampavarman. The writing of us, the assembly of Utkar. We have received one thousand *kadi* of paddy from Sadaiyan.

(L. 2.) We, the assembly, shall close (*the sluice of*) the tank (*to collect water for irrigation*), and shall cause five hundred *kadi* of paddy to be supplied every year as interest on these one thousand *kadi* of paddy.

(L. 3.) We declare that those who disobey this, shall incur (*all*) the sins committed between the Ganga and Kumari. The great men[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_5_to_8_ukkal.html#_ftn6) elected for the year shall cause (*the paddy*) to be supplied.

**No. 6.- On the south wall of the shrine**

This inscription is dated in the 1\[7\]th year of the reign of Rajaraja, (*alias)* Rajakesarivarman, and carries the list of his conquests as far as Kalingam. It appears to record that the village assembly assigned a daily supply of rice and oil to the temple of Mahasasta.[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_5_to_8_ukkal.html#_ftn7)
Some words in lines 7, 9 and 10 cannot be read and explained satisfactorily. A clause near the end of the inscription imposes a fine on those who would sell betel elsewhere but at the temple of Pidari.[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_5_to_8_ukkal.html#_ftn8)

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 1\[7\]th year (*of the reign*) of king Rajaraja-Rajakesarivarman, who, in his long life of growing strength, during which, - (*in*) the belief that, as well as the goddess of fortune, the goddess of the great earth had become his wife, - he was pleased to destroy the ships (*at*) Kandalur-Salai, and conquered by (*his*) army, which was victorious in great battles, Vengai-nadu, Ganga-padi, Tadigaipadi, Nulamba-padi, Kudamalai-nadu, Kollam and Kalingam,- deprived the Selinas of (*their*) splendour at the very moment when Udagai, which is worshipped everywhere, was (*most*) resplendent;- (*the subjoined*) document was drawn up by (*the following* *persons*) who were present in the temple of Mahasasta, in the hall (*ambalam*) to the north (*of it*) : We, the great assembly of Sivachulamanimangalam, *alias* Sri-Vikramabharana-chaturvedimangalam, (*a village*) in its own subdivision of Kaliyur-kottam, including the great men elected for (*the management of*) charities (?) during this year ; . . . . . . . . . . . . . . in our village ; and the commissioners[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_5_to_8_ukkal.html#_ftn9) (*in charge of the temple*) of Sattan in our village.

(L. 8.) To (*the temple of*) Mahasasta in our village, at each of the three times of the day[\[10\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_5_to_8_ukkal.html#_ftn10) two *nali* (*of rice*), *i.e.,* on each day six *nali* ; at each of the three times of the day, 20 . . . . . . . . . . . .of oil, *i.e.,* i.e. (one) *alakku* and two *sevidu* and a half of oil. . . . . . . . . . . . .

(L. 9.) Aruls\[ar\]man, *alias* Elunu\[rruvan\], the son of Sadai\[na\]kkas\[ar\]ma\[n\], the headman of \[Tattu\]r, who is (*also*) the headman of our village . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . having taken paddy (*in his hand*) and having taken (*one*) *uri* of paddy (*on*) a betel-leaf tray *(vattil*) and one bundle (?) of betel-leaves on a betel-leaf plate (*padaligai*),- it shall thus be done without fail as long as the moon and the sun exist.

(L. 13.) The commissioners (*of the temple*) of Sattan shall protect this charity. Those who cause obstruction to this charity, shall incur (*all*) the sins committed between the Ganga and Kumari.

(L. 15.) The great men elected for (*the supervision of*) the tank shall be entitled to levy a fine of (*one*) *kalanju* of gold in favour of the tank-fund from those betel-leaf sellers in this village, who sell (*betel-leaves*) elsewhere but at the temple of Pidari.

(L. 21.) Thus, we, the great assembly, have ordered. Having been present in the assembly and having heard (*their*) order, I, the arbitrator Dharmapriyan, the son of \[Ver\]rikkuri Nalayiravan, wrote (*this*). Prosperity !.

**No. 7.- On the south wall of the shrine**

This inscription is dated in the 16^(th) year of the reign of â€œKannaradeva, the conqueror of Kachchi (*i.e.,* Kanchipura) and Tanjai (*i.e.,* Tanjavur).â€? Mr. Venkayya has identified this king with Krishna III. of the Rashtrakuta dynasty (A.D. 940 and 956).[\[11\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_5_to_8_ukkal.html#_ftn11)

At the end of each line, about fifteen syllables are built in. Hence the translation remains fragmentary. As far as it can be made out, the inscription appears to record that the village assembly ordered the land with had lapsed to it, to be sold, and imposed certain conditions and fines in connection with this arrangement.

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! In the sixteenth year (*of the reign*) of the glorious Kannaradeva who conquered Kachchi and Tanjai, - we, the assembly of Sivachu\[lamanimangalam, *alias* Sri-Vikrama\]bharana-chaturvedimangalam, (*a village*) in its own subdivision of Kaliyur-kottam, being assembled in the front hall[\[12\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_5_to_8_ukkal.html#_ftn12) of the Puvanimanikka-Vishnugriham in our village, \[ordered\] as follows :-
