**III.- Inscriptions in the Pasupatisvara temple at Karuvur**

No. 20 south wall of the Pasupatisvara temple

[*No. 21 to 22 south wall of the shrine of the goddess*](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_21_to_22_karuvur.html)

[*No. 23 to 26 outside of the second prakara, left & right of entrance*](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_23_to_26_karuvur.html)

**No. 20.- On the south wall of the Pasupatisvara shrine**

This inscription refers itself to the time of Rajakesarivarman, *alias* Virarajendradeva (I.) (line 11), and records a royal grant which was to take effect â€œfrom the year which followed after the third year,â€?[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_20_karuvur.html#_ftn1) i.e., from the fourth year, the kingâ€™s reign. It opens with a panegyrical account of the donor, which resembles the introductions of four other inscriptions of his *viz.,* -

1\. Tv. = an inscription of the second year in the Svetaranyesvara temple at Tiruvenkadu in the Tanjore district (No. 113 of 1896).

2\. Tk. = an incomplete and undated inscription of the second year in the Svetaranyesvara temple at Tiruvenkadu in the Tanjore district (No. 113 of 1896).

3\. M.= an inscription of the fifth year in the Rajagopala-Perumal temple at Manimangalam in the Chingleput district (No. 2 of 1892).

4\. G.= a much damaged inscription of the fifth year in the Brihadisvara temple at Gangaikonda-Solapuram in the Trichinopoly district (No. 82 of 1892).

The historical introductions of these four inscriptions have been compared with the text of the subjoined inscription, and a selection of their various readings is given in the footnotes.

The period of the reign of Rajakesarivarman, *alias* Virarajendradeva I., can be approximately fixed in the following manner. According to his inscriptions, he defeated A havamalla and his two sons, Vikkalan and Singanan, at Kudalsangamam.[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_20_karuvur.html#_ftn2)
This battle is mentioned in the *Kalingattu-Parani* (viii. 29) and in the *Vikkirama-Solan-Ula*.[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_20_karuvur.html#_ftn3)
In these two poems the victor at Kudalsangamam is placed after the Chola kings Rajaraja I. (*Kalingattu-Parani*, viii. 24, and *Ind*. *Ant.* Vol. XXII. Page 142, note 3), Rajendra-Chola I. (viii. 25, and *l.c.* note 4), Rajadhiraja (Viii. 26, and *l.c.* noe 5), Parakesarivarman, *alias* Rajendradeva (viii. 27, and *l.c.* No. VII.)[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_20_karuvur.html#_ftn4) and a king who has not yet been identified (viii. 28, and *l.c.* No. VIII.). After the victor of Kudalsangamam, the *Vikkirama-Solan-Ula* places another king, of whom no particulars are given (*l.c.* No. X.), Kulottunga-Chola I. (*l.c.* note 7), and Vikrama-Chola (*l.c.* note 8).[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_20_karuvur.html#_ftn5)
Now, Professor Kielhornâ€™s astronomical calculations have definitely established the two facts that Rajadhiraja reigned from A.D. 1018 to about 1050, and that Kulottunga-Chola I. was crowned in A.D. 1070.[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_20_karuvur.html#_ftn6) Consequently, the victor at Koppam (Parakesarivarman, *alias* Rajendradeva) and the victor over the Kuntalas[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_20_karuvur.html#_ftn7) at Kudalsangamam (Rajakesarivarman, *alias* Virarajendradeva I.) must have reigned between A.D. 1050 and 1070. Further, as I have stated before,[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_20_karuvur.html#_ftn8) Ahavamalla and his two sons, Vikkalan and Singanan, who were the opponents of the three Chola kings Rajendra, Virarajendra I and Kulottunga I., have to be identified with the Western Chalukya king Ahavamalla-Somesvara I. (A.d. 1044 and 1068) and two of his sons, Vikramaditya VI. (A.D. 1055-56 and 1076 to 1126) and Jayasimha III. (A.D. 1064 and 1081-82).[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_20_karuvur.html#_ftn9)

Kudalsangamam, the site of Virarajendraâ€™s victory over the Chalukyas, has been located by Mr. V. Kanakasabhai Pillai at the junction of the Tungabhadra and Krishna.[\[10\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_20_karuvur.html#_ftn10) But both *kudal* and *samgama* mean â€˜junctionâ€™ and might refer to the confluence of any two rivers, *e.g.* to Kudali at the junction of the Tunga and Bhadra.[\[11\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_20_karuvur.html#_ftn11) The battle of Kudalsangamam was the third occasion on which Virarajendra I professes to have defeated the Chalukyas. He had already before driven Vikkalan from ganga-padi over the Tungabhadra (1. 3 f.), and on a second occasion he had defeated an army which his enemy had sent into Vengai-nadu under the *Mahadandanayaka* Chamundaraja. The latter was killed and his daughter Nagalai, who was the queen of Irugayan, mutilated (1. 4f.). Chamundaraja is probably identical with the *Mahamandalesvara* Chavundaraya of Banavasi, who is mentioned by Dr. Fleet[\[12\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_20_karuvur.html#_ftn12) as a feudatory of Somesvara I. with the dates A.D. 1045-46 and 1062-63.
Two other chiefs whose names occur in the account of the battle of Kudalsangamam,- though the context does not show on which side they were fighting,- Kesava-Dandanayaka and Marayan (1. 6), are perhaps identical with two other feudatories of the Chalukyas, the *Dandanayaka* Kesavadityadeva (*l.c.* 443) and Marasimha (*ibid*. p. 439).

The whole Chalukya camp fell into the hands of Virarajendra I., including the wives of the enemy, the boar-banner, and the female elephant *Pushpaka* (1. 8 f.). In the concluding portion of the introduction (1. 9 f.), the king claims to have killed the king of Pottappi,[\[13\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_20_karuvur.html#_ftn13) the Kerala king, the younger brother of Jananatha of Dhara, the Pandya king, and others.

Towards the beginning of the introduction (II. 1- 3) we learn the names of a few of the kingâ€™s near relatives. On his elder brother Alavandan he conferred the title Rajaraja ; on his son Madhurantaka the Tondi-mandalam (*i.e.,* the Pallava country) and the title Cholendra ;[\[14\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_20_karuvur.html#_ftn14) on his son Gangaikonda-Chola the Pandi-mandalam (*i.e.,* the Pandya country) and the title Chola-Pandya ; and on Mudikonda-Chola the title Sundara-Chola.[\[15\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_20_karuvur.html#_ftn15)
According to the Tanjavur inscription of Kulottunga I.[\[16\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_20_karuvur.html#_ftn16) the name of Virarajendraâ€™s wife was Arumoli-Nangai.

The immediate purpose of the subjoined inscription is to record that the king, residing in his palace at Gangaikonda-Solapuram[\[17\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_20_karuvur.html#_ftn17) (1. 11 f.), granted to the Karuvur temple the village of Pakkur, which, like Karuvur itself (1. 14), belonged to Vengala-nadu, a district of Adhirajaraja-mandalam (1. 12).

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! While the goddess of fortune was prospering ; while the circle of the great earth rested on (*the kingâ€™s*) round arm (*as lightly*) as his bracelet of jewels, and while the shadow of (*his*) royal white parasol (*set with*) numerous jewels protected the living beings of the circle of the earth (*more tenderly*) than the mother that bore (*them*) ; while (*all*) other kings (*wearing*) sounding ankle-rings took shelter at his feet ; (*and*) while the Kali (*age*), in despair, retreated to (*its*) natural abode : the abyss, - (*the king*) duly[\[18\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_20_karuvur.html#_ftn18) bestowed a splendid crown of jewels on (*his*) incomparable[\[19\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_20_karuvur.html#_ftn19) elder brother, \[Ala\]vandan, (*along with the title*) â€˜Rajaraja[\[20\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_20_karuvur.html#_ftn20) who is praised on the great earth.â€™[\[21\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_20_karuvur.html#_ftn21)

(L. 2.) (*He*) was pleased to grant the Pandi-mandalam, whose crown of jewels is exalted in this world, to his royal son Gangaikonda-Solan, (*along with the title*) â€˜Sola-Pandiyan, (*the leader*) of an army of very tall elephants.â€™ (*H*e) bestowed a brilliant crown on Mudikonda-Solan, whose hand (*held*) the sword (*and*) whose spear had a sharp point, (*along with the title*) Sundara-Solan, and conferred endless great distinctions (*on him*). (*Thus he*) granted to each of his numerous relations[\[22\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_20_karuvur.html#_ftn22) suitable great riches.
