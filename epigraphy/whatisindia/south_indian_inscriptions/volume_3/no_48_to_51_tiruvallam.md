**No. 48.- On the west wall of the Bilvanathesvara shrine**

As stated in the introductory remarks to No. 47, the subjoined inscription was copied from an earlier stone inscription when the central shrine of the temple was pulled down. It records the gift of a lamp by the same queen as No. 47, who was the consort of the Bana king Vanavidyadhara and the daughter of Pratipati-Araiyar (*i.e.,* the Western Ganga king Prithivipati I.), the son of Sivamaharaja. From the subjoined inscription we learn that her actual name was Kundavvai.[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_48_to_51_tiruvallam.html#_ftn1)

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! We, the assembly of Tikkali-Vallam, have received forty *kalanju* of pure gold from Kundavv\[ai\]yar, *alias* Vanamahadevi, - the daughter of Pratipati-Araiyar, the son of \[K\]o\[n\]gu\[n\]I\[va\]rman, the very righteous *Maharaja,* the supreme lord of Nipunilapura,[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_48_to_51_tiruvallam.html#_ftn2) *alias* Srinathan, the glorious Sivamaharaja-Perumanadigal, (*and the queen of*) Vanavidyadha\[ra\]raja, *alias* Vanaraya, born from the family of Mahabali, who had been made door-keeper by the lord of gods and demons, Paramesvara (*Siva*), who is worshipped in all the three worlds.

(L. 3.) (*In return*), we, the assembly, shall have to burn, as long as the moon and the sun exist, one perpetual lamp before (*the god*) Tiruttikkali-Perumanadigal, supplying daily (*one*) *uri* of fresh ghee and a quarter of camphor.

(L. 4.) We, the assembly, have agreed that, whenever (*they*) fail in this charity, all the *Mahesvaras* (*among us*) shall pay into court a fine of five *kalanju* of gold per day. Though fined thus, we shall have to burn this sacred lamp without fail. Those among us, who say that this (*charity*) is not (*existing*) shall incur (*all*) the sins committed between the Ganga and Kumari.

(L. 5.) â€œThis charity (*is placed under*) the protection of all *Mahesvaras.* The feet of those who protect this charity, (*shall be*) on my head.â€?

We, the assembly, gave (*the following*) land in the environs[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_48_to_51_tiruvallam.html#_ftn3) of the village, which (the queen) had granted, free of taxes, for this camphor lamp and the perpetual lamp[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_48_to_51_tiruvallam.html#_ftn4) : - (*one*) *nilam[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_48_to_51_tiruvallam.html#_ftn5)* and 400 *kuli* (*called*) *Parkuttai*, 720 *kuli* below the old tank (*Palaveri*), and 2 *nilam* (*called*) *Nonidukolli*.

(L. 6.) As the land granted for these two lamps had become torn up by the weather,[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_48_to_51_tiruvallam.html#_ftn6) we, the assembly, assigned only an oil lamp for burning.

**No. 49.- On the south wall of the Bilvanathesvara shrine**

This inscription belongs to the 7^(th) year of the reign of Rajaraja-Kesarivarman, *i.e.,* of the Chola king Rajaraja I. It contains a date which admits of astronomical calculation, and which has been repeatedly discussed since its discovery in 1890.[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_48_to_51_tiruvallam.html#_ftn7)
Professor Kielhorn has shown that it corresponds to the 26^(th) September A.D. 991.[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_48_to_51_tiruvallam.html#_ftn8)

The inscription records a visit to the temple by a certain Madurantakan-Kandaradittanar, who caused one thousand jars of water to be poured over the god. When he had finished his worship, he observed that the offerings in the temple had been reduced to a minimum and that the temple lamps were only feebly burning. He called for the authorities of the temple and of the village and asked them for a detailed statement of the temple revenue and expenditure.

Here unfortunately the inscription is built in. But from the preserved portion it is evident that Madurantakan-Kandaradittanar, *i.e.,*
Gandaraditya, the son of Madhurantaka, must have been a person of high standing and influence. He cannot be identical with the Chola king Gandaradityavarman, because the latter had died before the reign of Arimjaya, the grandfather of Rajaraja I.[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_48_to_51_tiruvallam.html#_ftn9)
Perhaps he was an (*otherwise unknown*) son of Madhurantaka, the son of Gandaradityavarman and immediate predecessor of Rajaraja I.[\[10\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_48_to_51_tiruvallam.html#_ftn10)

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 7^(th) year (*of the reign*) of king Rajaraja-Kesarivarman, - on the day of an eclipse of the moon at the equinox which corresponded to (*the day of*) *Revati* and to the full-moon *tithi* of the month of *Aippasi* in this very year, - Madurantakan-Kandaradittanar came in order to have one thousand jars of water poured over (*the god*) Tiruttikkali-Alvar at Tikkali-Vallam in Miyaru-nadu, (*a subdivision*) of Paduvur-kottam, and worshipped the holy feet (*of the god*).

(L. 3.) While (*he*) stood (*in the temple*), (*he observed*) that the offerings presented to the Alvar were reduced to two *nali* of rice, that the offerings of Vegetables, the offerings of ghee and the offerings of curds had ceased, and that the perpetual lamps were neglected.

(L. 7.) (*He*) called for the *Siva-Brahmanas* of this sacred temple and the members of the assembly of Tikkali-Vallam and asked : - â€œState the revenue and expenditure of this temple, in accordance with the royal order and the royal letter.â€?

(L. 11.) The \[*Siva-*\]*Brahmanas* and the members of the assembly of Tikkali-Vallam . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

**No. 50.- On the west wall of the Bilvanathesvara shrine**

This inscription is dated in the same year of the reign of Rajaraja I. as No. 49. It records that a Brahmana set up an image of the goddess and granted a lamp to the temple. He also purchased 1,700 *kuli* of land from the inhabitants of the village of Mandiram in Tunadu and made it over to the temple authorities, who had to feed the lamp and to supply offerings from the produce of the land.

Tunadu, to which Mandiram belonged, was the name of the country round Melpadi.[\[11\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_48_to_51_tiruvallam.html#_ftn11)
Mandiram had the surname Jayameru-Srikaranamangalam (11. 2 and 15 f.), which seems to be derived from Jayameru, one of the surnames of the Bana king Vikramaditya I.[\[12\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_48_to_51_tiruvallam.html#_ftn12)

(Line 1.) Hail 1 Prosperity ! In the seventh year (*of the reign*) of king Rajaraja-Kesarivarman. (*The writing of*) us, the assembly of Mandiram, *alias* Jayameru-Srikaranamangalam, in Tunadu.
