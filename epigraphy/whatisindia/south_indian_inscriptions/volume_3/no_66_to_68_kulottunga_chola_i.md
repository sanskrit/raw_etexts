**No. 66.- Inscription at Kolar**

This inscription (No. 131 of 1892) is engraved on the east wall of the Kolaramma temple at Kolar in the Mysore State. In the Chola inscriptions of the temple the goddess is called Pidari,[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_66_to_68_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn1) and Kolar itself Kuvalalam. As the traditional capital of the Ganga family it is mentioned under the names of Kuvalalapura,[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_66_to_68_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn2) Kolalapura and Kolahalapura.[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_66_to_68_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn3) According to the subjoined inscription (1. 5) it belonged to Kuvalala-nadu, a district of Vijayarajaendra-mandalam.

The historical introduction and the date of this inscription are identical with those of Nos. 64 and 65. The inscription records that an officer named Virasikhamani-Muvendavelar inspected the temple and appointed a committee,[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_66_to_68_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn4) which seems to have made allotments to various shrines included in the temple. The temple revenue had been originally paid by the temple villages in gold coins (madai), but was subsequently converted into supplies of paddy. We learn that one *madai* corresponded to two *kasu* (1. 11) and that one *kasu* purchased about 2 Â¾ *kalam* of paddy (1. 11 f.). In the Tiruvallam inscription of Adhirajendra one *kasu* corresponds to four *kalam* of paddy.[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_66_to_68_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn5)
The Tanjore inscriptions of Rajaraja I. and Rajendra-Choda I.[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_66_to_68_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn6) fix the interest per *kasu* at 3 *kuruni* of paddy or one eighth *kasu*, from which it follows that one *kasu* corresponded to 24 *kuruni*, *i.e., 2 kalam*. This shows that the prices of grain must have varied considerably either according to the locality or at different times.

The preserved portion of the inscription consists of 28 lines. At the end of each of the lines 1 to 7 a few syllables are lost ; at the end of line 8 much more is lost ; and from line 9 it is impossible to supply the missing portions of each line. To give a general idea of the contents of the inscriptions, I am publishing the text as far as line 13, but am quoting also from the unpublished portion in the following list of shrines to which allotments were made : - Virabhadradeva (1. 12), Brahmani, Isvari (1. 13), Vaishnavi (1. 14), Indrani (1. 15), Ganapati (1. 16), Chamundesvari of the chief shrine (*mulasthana*) (1. 17), Kshetrapaladeva, Mahasasta[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_66_to_68_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn7) (1. 18), Suryadeva (1. 19), Yogini and Yogesvara (11. 24 and 27). At the worship of the two last deities intoxicating drinks (*madya-pana*) were consumed.
