The copper-plate grants allot to the Eastern Chalukya king Rajaraja I. a reign of 41 years,[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_i_a.html#_ftn1) while the Pithapuram inscription of Mallapadeva gives him 40 years.[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_i_a.html#_ftn2)
Accordingly, his death and the accession of his son Kulottunga I. would *prima facie* fall in A.D. 1061-62 or 1062-63. This date is not borne out by the Telugu inscriptions of Kulottunga I. which contain both a Saka date and a regnal year, and according to which the accession took place in Saka-Samvat 991-92 = A.D. 1069-71.[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_i_a.html#_ftn3)
And Professor Kielhornâ€™s calculations of the dates of Tamil and Kanarese inscriptions prove that his reign commenced between the 14^(th) March and the 8^(th) October A.D. 1070.[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_i_a.html#_ftn4)

The original name of the king was Rajendra-Choda,[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_i_a.html#_ftn5) and in the Tamil inscriptions of his 2^(nd), 3^(rd) and 4^(th) years (Nos. 64 to 67 and 77 below) he is actually called Rajakesarivarman, *alias* Rajendra-Choladeva (II.). The account of Kulottungaâ€™s birth and youth in the *Kalingattu-Parani[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_i_a.html#_ftn6)* seems to imply that he was adopted by Gangaikonda-Chola (*i.e.,* Rajendra-Chola I.), who apparently had no son of his own, and that he was nominated the heir-apparent of his grandfather. If the *Kalingattu-Parani* (xiii. Verse 62) calls Kulottungaâ€™s father Pandita-Chola, this can hardly refer to his real father, the Eastern Chalukya king, but must mean his adoptive father, Rajendra-Chola I.
That the latter had the surname Pandita-Chola may be concluded from two of his Tanjore inscriptions,[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_i_a.html#_ftn7) which mention a regiment entitled Pandita-Sola-terinda-villigal, *i.e.,* â€˜the chosen archers of Pandita-Chola.â€™ While still heir-apparent,[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_i_a.html#_ftn8) Kulottunga I. distinguished himself by capturing elephants at Vayiragaram and by defeating the king of Dhara at Sakkarakottam.[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_i_a.html#_ftn9)

According to the copper-plate grants his first charge was the country of Vengi,[\[10\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_i_a.html#_ftn10) which had been ruled over by his father and paternal grandfather.
Instead of â€˜the Vengi country,â€™ Kulottungaâ€™s Tamil inscriptions use the expression â€˜the region of the rising of the sun,â€™[\[11\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_i_a.html#_ftn11) and the Pithapuram pillar inscriptions employ the term Andhra-mandala or Andhra-vishaya,[\[12\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_i_a.html#_ftn12) *i.e.,* the Telugu country. Kulottunga is stated to have entrusted this province to viceroys, first to his uncle Vijayaditya VII., then to his second son Rajaraja II., next to his third son Vira-Choda,[\[13\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_i_a.html#_ftn13) who assumed office on the 23^(rd) August A.D. 1078,[\[14\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_i_a.html#_ftn14) and finally to Choda of Velanandu.[\[15\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_i_a.html#_ftn15)
Vijayaditya VII.

Is said to have governed Vengi for 15 years and Rajaraja II. for 1 year. If we deduct the sum of these two reigns from A.D. 1078, the year of Vira-Chodaâ€™s appointment, the result is A.D. 1062 as the date of Vijayadityaâ€™s accession. This year coincides with the end of the reign of the Eastern Chalukya king Rajaraja I., but is 8 years prior to Kulottungaâ€™s coronation. This discrepancy may be explained in the following manner. The Chola king Virarajendra I. claims to have conquered the country of Vengi and to have bestowed it on Vijayaditya.[\[16\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_i_a.html#_ftn16)
This expedition may have taken place just after the death of Rajaraja I. who was succeeded in A.D. 1062 by his brother Vijayaditya VII. It looks as if the rightful heir Kulottunga I. had been ousted by the latter with the assistance of Virarajendra I.[\[17\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_i_a.html#_ftn17)
This would explain the fact noted before, that Kulottunga came to the throne 8 years after his fatherâ€™s death. As noted by Dr. Fleet,[\[18\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_i_a.html#_ftn18) Vijayaditya VII. Had later on to apply to Rajaraja of Kalinganagara (A.D. 1071 to 1078) for assistance against the Choda who threatened to absorb his dominions. This Chola enemy was no doubt Kulottunga I. who, after Vijayadityaâ€™s death, repaced him by Rajaraja II. and soon after by Vira-Choda.

The localities in which the inscriptions of Kulottungaâ€™s 2^(nd) year[\[19\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_i_a.html#_ftn19) (A.D. 1071-72) are found show that he was then in possession of Tiruvorriyur, Tiruvalangadu and Kolar. An inscription of his 3^(rd) year (No. 67 below) is found at Somangalam (near Manimangalam), and one of his 4^(th) year (No. 77 below) at Kavantandalam (between Conjeeveram and Uttaramallur).

The Chellur plates of Vira-Choda state that Kulottunga I. conquered the Kerala, Pandya and Kuntala countries and was anointed to the Choda kingdom under the name Kulottungadeva.[\[20\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_i_a.html#_ftn20) Instead of â€˜the Choda kingdomâ€™ the Pithapuram inscription of Mallapadeva uses the expression â€˜the five Dravidas.â€™[\[21\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_i_a.html#_ftn21)
The first inscription in which he is called Kulottunga-Choladeva is one of the 5^(th) year of his reign, *i.e.,* A.D. 1074-75, at Conjeeveram (No. 68 below). It states that he defeated the king of Kuntala, that he crowned himself as king of the Chola country, and that he decapitated an unnamed Pandya king. In speaking of â€˜the prostitution of the Lakshmi of the Southern region.â€™ And â€˜the loneliness fo the goddess of the country on the banks of the Kaveri,â€™ the inscription suggests that, before Kulottungaâ€™s arrival in the South, the Chola country had lapsed into a state of anarchy and lost its ruler. A similar account of the condition of the Chola country is given in the *Kalingattu-Parani*, which states besides that Kulottunga defeated Virudaraja[\[22\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_i_a.html#_ftn22) and that â€˜the king of kingsâ€™ had met with his death. A third account of the same events is furnished by Bilhana in his *Vikramankadevacharila*.[\[23\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_i_a.html#_ftn23)
During the reign of his elder brother Somesvara II. (A.D. 1069 to 1076), Vikramaditya VI. Married the daughter of the Chola king. Shortly after â€œthe news reached him that his father-in-law was dead and that the Chola kingdom was in a state of anarchy.â€? He immediately started for Kanchi and Gangakundapura[\[24\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_i_a.html#_ftn24) and put his wifeâ€™s brother on the Chola throne. A few days after his return from this expedition, â€œhe learnt that his brother-in-law had lost his life in a fresh rebellion and that Rajiga, the lord of Vengi, had taken possession of the throne of Kanchi.â€? Rajiga found an ally in Somesvara II., but Vikramaditya VI. Put Rajiga to flight, took Somesvara II. prisoner and ascended the throne himself in A.D. 1076.
Dr. Fleet was the first to recognize that Rajiga is a familiar form of Rajendra-Choda, the original name of Kulottunga I.[\[25\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_i_a.html#_ftn25)
The Chola king whose daughter became the wife of Vikramaditya VI. Is identical with Virarajendra I., one of whose inscriptions proves that he entered into friendly relations with Vikramaditya VI.[\[26\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_i_a.html#_ftn26) The son and successor of Virarajendra I. and the brother-in-law of Vikramaditya VI. Was Parakesarivarman, *alias* Adhirajendra.[\[27\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_i_a.html#_ftn27)
He is probably the â€˜king of kings,â€™ whose death, according to the *Kalingattu-Parani,* preceded Kulottungaâ€™s arrival in the Chola country. Finally, the Virudaraja of the *Kalingattu-Parani*, and the king of Kuntala whom Kulottunga claims to have defeated, is Vikramaditya VI. The war between these two kings must fall before A.D. 1074-75, the date of No. 68 below.

An inscription of the 11^(th) year = A.D. 1080-81 (No. 78 below) adds that Kulottunga I. drove Vikkalan (*i.e.,* Vikramaditya VI.) from Nangili (in the Kolar district) by way of Manalur to the Tungabhadra river, and that he conquered the Ganga-mandalam and Singanam. A later inscription (No. 73 below) substitutes Alatti for Manalur and â€˜the country of Konkanaâ€™[\[28\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_i_a.html#_ftn28) for Singanam. Neither Manalur[\[29\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_i_a.html#_ftn29) nor Alatti can be identified. Singanam seems to refer to the dominions of Jayasimha III., Vikramadityaâ€™s younger brother to whom he had given the office of viceroy of Banavasi.[\[30\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_i_a.html#_ftn30)
