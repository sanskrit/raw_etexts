This record which is dated in the 16^(th) year of Parakesarivarman, registers a sale of land by the village assembly, for the maintenance of a lamp in the temple of Siva at Tirukkarugavur. The inscription may be one of king Parakesarivarman uttama-Chola on account of its high regnal year, if not one of Parakesarivarman Parantaka I.

(Line 1.). Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 3^(rd) year of (*the reign of*) king Parakesarivarman, (to the god) Mahadeva (*Siva*) of Tirukkarugavur.[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/uttama_chola.html#_ftn2)

(L. 3.) Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 16^(th) year of (*the reign of*) king Parakesarivarman, we the great men of the chief assembly (*mula-parudai*) of this village gave the following land free of taxes till the moon and the sun (*endure*) to this god Mahadeva (*Siva*) of Tirukkarugavur.

| \>  |

(L. 7.) Two *ma* of our land of Sabhaikuttuvan in the northern *kandam* of the land belonging to the sacred interior and one *ma* (*of land*) to the west of the southern *kandam*,â€” in all, three *ma* of land comprised of two *tadi* ; and one *kani* of land (*called*) Sundaikuli in (*the field called*) Sabhaikuttuvan which being a *mania* is cultivated and is yielding crop; â€” together, three ma and (*one*) *kani* of land including excess and deficiency (*in measurement*), (*we*) have sold and received thirty-one *kasu* of *palavavu[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/uttama_chola.html#_ftn3)*.
Having received these thirty-one *kasu* we the great men of the chief assembly sold this land (*viz*.,) three *ma* and *kam[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/uttama_chola.html#_ftn4)* to (*the god*) Mahadeva (*Siva*) of Tirukkarugavur and exempted it from taxes, it being tax-free already, as long as the moon and the sun (*endure*). This (*shall be under*)the protection of (*the assembly of*) all *Mahesvaras.*

**No. 124.â€” ON THE NORTH WALL OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE IN THE MAHALINGASVAMIN TEMPLE AT TIRUVIDAIMARUDUR**[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/uttama_chola.html#_ftn5)

This inscription is dated in the 4^(th) year of Parakesarivarman and registers that the assembly of Tiraimur, the merchants of Tiruvidaimarudil (*the modern Tiruvidaimarudur*), the trustees and other officers of the temple assembled in the theatrical hall of the temple and made up an account of the gifts of gold made for maintaining lamps in that temple. It is stated that the stones which bore the original inscriptions regardings these gifts were placed in underground cellars and when the temple was renovated, true copies were made of them and that from these copies the documents were re-incised on the stone walls of the renovated temple. One such gift was that made by Kadupatttigal Nandippottaraiyar for burning a lamp called *Kumaramartandan*.

The acting of dramas in temples is mentioned in a Tanjore inscription of the time of Rajaraja I. The present record contains, though incidentally, an earlier reference to dramatic performances by introducing the term nadagasalai in line 1. The inscription gives us also an idea of how the important documents of a temple were engraved on stones and preserved in underground cellars and how when the temples had to be renovated they were copied over and re-engraved.

Kadupattigal Nandippottaraiyar may possibly be Nandivarman Pallavamalla of the Udayaendiram grant.[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/uttama_chola.html#_ftn6)

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 4^(th) year and \[3\]25^(th) day of (*the reign of*) king Parakesarivarman, there being present in the theatrical hall (*nadagasalai*) of the god at Tiruvidaimarudil, the assembly of Tiraimur whose business it was to regulate the temple affairs (*srikaryam*) of this god, the merchants (*nagarattar*) of Tiruvidaimarudil, the trustees of the sacred temple, the temple-accountant Marudan Piramakutan, and the temple manager (*srikaryamarayginra)* Pusalankudaiyar, an account was made up of the lamps maintained from the interest (*on money*)deposited for (*the benefit of*) the god.

(L. 2.) All the documentary stones of (i.e., *relating of*) (*investments on*) interest (*by the temple*) having been copied over[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/uttama_chola.html#_ftn7) and kept as on the stones which were placed below in the underground cellars, prior to the renovation of this temple (*srikoyil*) in stone, it was ordered that in the same manner as the transferred copies were made before (*from the originals*) (*they*) may now be re-engraved on the stones of the sacred stone temple; and (the following) (*copy*) was thus engraved on the stone:â€” Kadupattigal Nandippottaraiyar gave 60 *kalanju[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/uttama_chola.html#_ftn8)* of gold for a lamp called *Kumaramarttandan*. One lamp (*has to be maintained*) from (*one*) uri of ghee to be measured (*daily*) by the (*members of the*) assembly of Tiraimur who received this sixty *kalanju* of gold.

**No. 125.â€” ON THE NORTH BASE OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE IN THE VARAHA-PERUMAL TEMPLE AT TIRUVADANDAI**[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/uttama_chola.html#_ftn9)

The record is dated in the 6^(th) year of Parakesarivarman and registers a gift of gold for a lamp to the Manavala-Perumal temple at Tiruvaidavandai situated in Paduvur-nadu, a subdivision of Amur-kottam.

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prsperity ! In the 6^(th) year of (*the reign of*) king Parakesarivarman, we the villagers (*urom)* of Tiruvidavandai in Paduvur-nadu, (*a subdivision*) of Amur-kottam signed (*the following deed*) : -

(L. 2.) (*Whereas*) we have received thirty *kalanju* of gold from the hands of Nakkan Enadi, the headman of Innambar on the northern bank (*of the Kaveri)* in the Chola country (*So-nadu*), (*we* *affirm that*) we have received this gold and agree to measure 90 *nali* of oil (*as interest*) on this 30 *kalanju* of gold, at (*one*) *ulakku* of oil every day, for (*burning*) one perpetual lamp in (*the temple of*) Manavala-Perumal of this village. We (*thus*) agreed and received the gold and shall measure for this gold and (*quantity of*) oil (*agreed upon*) as long as the moon land the sun (*endure*). We the villagers (*also*) agree that we shall not pay gold and say (*that it is for*) interest[\[10\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/uttama_chola.html#_ftn10).
If we fail (to do) this, we shall submit (*to a fine of*) four and a quarter *kanam* for each day (*of default*), in a court of justice after producing the *undigai* and *pattigai* (effects ?) and we shall also pay as *manrupadu* (*one*) *manjadi* of gold for every day (*of default*), to the then-reigning king. And paying this fine and the *manrupadu*, we the villagers (*still*) agree to measure out without (*further*) default to (the persons of) the *tiruvunnaligai-variyam* this (*stipulated quantity of*) oil for burning (*the lamp*).
