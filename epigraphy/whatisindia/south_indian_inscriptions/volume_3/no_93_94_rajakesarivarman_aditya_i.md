**X.- Inscriptions of Rajakesarivarman Aditya I**

No. 93 to 94 natural cave at Vedal & Silaiyamman, Airavatesvara temple

[*No. 89 to 92 Ghritasthanesvara temple & Jnanaparamesvara temple*](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/rajakesarivarman_aditya_i.html)

**No. 93.â€” ON A SLAB SET UP IN FRONT OF THE SILAIYAMMAN TEMPLE AT NERKUNAM**.[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_93_94_rajakesarivarman_aditya_i.html#_ftn1)

This inscription, dated in the 24^(th) year of Rajakesarivarman, registers a grant of land for the upkeep of a tank at Nerukunram on the eastern side of Singapura-nadu by the Nambiyamallanar, son of Nripatungamangalapperaraiyan. The name Nripatungamangalapperaraiyan and the achaic characters of the inscription make it very probable that the record is one of Rajakesarivarman Aditya I.

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 24^(th) year of (*the reign of)* king Rajakesarivarman, the (*following gift of*) erippatti (*viz., the fields*), Marudancheruvu, Kodumadi and Kaluval was made by Nambiyamallan, son of Nripatungamangalapperaraiyar, declaring these to be tank-land (*erippatti*) for (*the maintenance of*) the tank at Nerkunram on the eastern side (*kilvali*)[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_93_94_rajakesarivarman_aditya_i.html#_ftn2) of Singapura-nadu. If we, the villager, assert our occupancy rights (*kudimai-sey*) (*in such a way*) as to reduce this (*charity*), we shall enter the hell lower than the seventh hell. He who reduces the *erippatti* shall also enter the hell lower than the seventh hell. The feet of the person who protects and perpetuates this shall be on my head.

(L. 27.) Nambiyamallan, gave, solely for (*the benefit of*) the tank, every kind of duty levied by the assembly (*manrupadu*) including *anavay-dandam[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_93_94_rajakesarivarman_aditya_i.html#_ftn3)*.
Whose reduces this shall also enter the hell lower than the seventh hell. We, the villagers, also shall enter the hell lower than the seventh hell, if we assert our occupancy rights so as to reduce this (*charity*). The feet of him who protects and perpetuates this shall be on my head.

**No. 94.â€” ON THE NORTH WALL OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE IN THE AIRAVATESVARA TEMPLE AT NIYAMAM.\[4\]**

The record belongs to the 24^(th) year of the early Chola king Rajakesarivarman and has to be assigned to Aditya I on palaeographical grounds. It registers a gift of gold by Adigal Gandan Marambavai[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_93_94_rajakesarivarman_aditya_i.html#_ftn5), queen of Nandippottaraiyar of the Pallavatilaka race. The fact that this Pallava queen made a grant in the reign of the Chola king suggests that the Pallavas had been completely subdued by this time, as stated in the Tiruvalangadu grant and that Nandippottaraiyar, the husband of Marambavai, was also dead.
