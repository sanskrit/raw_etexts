**No. 27.- On the south wall of the shrine in the Rajagopala-Perumal temple**

This inscription is dated in the 6^(th) year of the reign of the Chola king Rajakesarivarman[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn1) (1. 2). It opens with two Sanskrit verses, which state that a person whose name is not given made a grant to the Vishnu temple at Ratnagrahara or Ratnagrama, *i.e.,* Manimangalam. From the following Tamil passage it appears that the donor had purchased the land from the inhabitants of Manimangalam. The grant consisted of 4,000 *kuli* of land, of which 2,000 were situated on the west of Manimangalam and south of Kulattur, the modern Kolattur.[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn2)
The remaining 2,000 *kuli* were situated on the south of Manimangalam and east of Amanpakkam â€“ the modern Ammanambakkam.[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn3)

In this archaic inscription the *virama* is marked above several letters by a dot (*pulli*), just as in the modern Tamil print. The Grantha *na* of *pranasa* (1. 1) is expressed by a compound letter which differs from the Tamil *na.[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn4)*

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity !

(Verse 1.) Resplendent is (*the village*) whose famous name is Ratnagrahara (*and which is*) an embodiment of the union of the two goddesses of learning and prosperity, able to remove distress, of lovely fame (*and*) an ocean of all gems â€“ noble qualities.

(V. 2.) (*He*)[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn5) founded, for as long as the moon and the stars endure, a perpetual enjoyment (bhoga) of the god who resides in (*the temple of*) Srimad-Dvara in the *agrahara* of Ratnagrama.

(Line 2.) In the 6^(th) year (*of the reign*) of king Rajakesarivarman, we, the great assembly of Manimangalam, *alias* Lokamahadevi-chaturvedimangalam, (*in the district*) of Sengattu-kottam, sold (*the following*) land to (*the temple of*) Srimad-Dvarapurideva in our village.

(L. 3.) Two thousand *kuli*, enclosed within the following four boundaries : - (*The eastern boundary is*) to the west of the boundary of Maganur, a hamlet on the west (*of our village*) ; (*the southern boundary is*) to the north of the bank of the *Periyaputteri* (tank) ; the western boundary (*is*) to the east of the *Kalichchangal*
(*channel*) ;[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn6) and the northern boundary (*is*) to the south of the boundary of Kulattur.

(L. 4.) Two thousand *kuli*, below the *Putteri* (tank) at (?) Perur, a hamlet on the south (*of our* *village*), enclosed within the following four boundaries : - The eastern boundary (*is*) to the west of Kudumbidupadagam ; the southern boundary (*is*) to the north of the *Mannikkal* (*channel*) ; the western boundary (*is*) to the east of the boundary of Amanapa\[kka\]m ; and the northern boundary (*is*) to the east of the boundary of Amanpa\[kka\]m; and the northern boundary (*is*) to the east of the boundary of Amanapa\[kka\]m ; and the northern boundary (*is*) to the south of the bank of the tank.

(L. 7.) Altogether four thousand *Kuli* were given, for as long as the moon and the sun exist (*and*) free of taxes, by us, the great assembly.

(L. 8.) On this land we shall not be entitled to claim any taxes, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . forced labour (*vetti*), *vedi* and *kanam*.[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn7)

(L. 9.) We, the great assembly, agree that each of those who claim (*them*) shall pay a fine[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn8) of twenty-five *kalanju* of gold.

(L. 10.) (*This charity is placed under*) the protection of the *Sri-Vaishnavas*.

**No. 28.- On the north and west walls of the shrine in the Rajagopala-Perumal Temple**

This inscription is dated in the 29^(th) year of Rajakesarivarman, *alias* Rajadhirajadeva, surnamed Jayankonda-Chola (1. 7).[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn9)
It opens with a panegyrical account of the kingâ€™s deeds. The text of this passage has been settled by comparison with the corresponding introductions of three other inscriptions, *viz.,*

1\. Tk.- an inscription of the 29^(th) year in the Svetaranyesvara temple at Tiruvenkadu in the Tanjore district (No. 114 of 1896).

2\. Tr. = an inscription of the 31^(st) year in the Adhipurisvara temple at Tiruvorriyur near Madras (No. 107 of 1892).

3\. Tai. = an inscription of the 32^(nd) year in the Panchanadesvara temple at Tiruvaiyaru near Tanjore (No. 221 of 1894)

Among the achievements of Rajadhiraja the subjoined inscription mentions that the â€œdestroyed the palace of the Chalukya king in the city of Kampiliâ€? (1. 6). As I have said before,[\[10\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn10) this statement enables us to identify Rajadhiraja with the king who, according to the *Kalingattu-Parani* (viii. 26), â€œplanted a pillar of victory at Kampili,â€? and to place his reign immediately after that of Rajendra-Chola I. and before that of Parakesarivarman, *alias* Rajendradeva. Rajendra-Chola I. ascended the throne in A.D. 1001-2 and reigned until at least A.D. 1032.[\[11\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn11)
An inscription at Mindigal proves that Rajadhirajaâ€™s anointment to the throne took place in A.D. 1018.[\[12\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn12)
This would be about the 17^(th) year of the reign of his predecessor Rajendra-Chola I. Consequently, Rajadhiraja appears to have been the co-regent of the latter and cannot have exercised independent royal functions before the death of the other. It is in perfect accordance with this conclusion that his inscriptions which have been discovered so far are all dated in the later years of his reign, *viz.,* between the 26^(th) and 32^(nd) years.

The introduction of the subjoined inscription states that Rajadhiraja appointed seven of his relatives to be governors over the Chera, Chalukya, Pandya and Ganga countries, the island of Ceylon, the Pallava country, and Kanyakubja (1. 1). This statement is evidently exaggerated, at least as far as it refers to the Chalukya dominions and Kanyakubja.[\[13\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn13)
Next are mentioned three Pandya kings (1. 1f.). The first of them, Manabharana, was decapitated ; the second, Vira-Kerala, was trampled down by an elephant ; and the third, Sudnara-Pandya, was expelled to Mullaiyur. Further, Rajadhiraja killed an unnamed king of Venadu, *i.e.,* Travancore, and three princes of Iramagudam (?). Having routed the Chera king, he followed the example of his ancestor Rajaraja I. in destroying the ships at Kandalur-Salai[\[14\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_27_manimangalam.html#_ftn14) (1. 2f.)
