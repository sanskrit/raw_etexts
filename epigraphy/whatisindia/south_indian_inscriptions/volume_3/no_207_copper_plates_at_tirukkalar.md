[*No. 206 Two Pandya copper-plate grants from Sinnamanur*](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/copper_plates_at_tirukkalar.html)

[*No. 209 Tirukkalar Plate of Kulottungs-Chola I*](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_209_copper_plates_at_tirukkalar.html)

[*No. 211 Tirukkalar Plate of Kulottunga-Chola III & Rajakesarivarman*](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_211_copper_plates_at_tirukkalar.html)

**No. 207.â€” Tirukkalar plate of Rajendra-Chola I**

These are five copper-plates belonging to the Parijatavanesvara temple at Tirukkalar, a village ten miles south-east of Mannargudi in the Tanjore district[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_207_copper_plates_at_tirukkalar.html#_ftn1).
A short notice of these appeared in Dr. Hultzschâ€™s *Annual Report on Epigraphy* for 1902 â€” 03, paragraph 17. The report also contains a list of 23 stone inscriptions which were copied from the same temple.[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_207_copper_plates_at_tirukkalar.html#_ftn2)
These five copper-plates, strung on a copper-ring of 5â€? diameter, have flat rims, measure 1â€™ 7/8â€? x 5 Â½ â€œ each, weigh together 566 tolas and have ring-holes bored in the middle of the left margin about an inch from the edge. They contain in them five complete inscriptions of different Chola kings. The first of them, which is also the earliest, is a record of Parakesarivarman Rajendra-Chola I who ascended the Chola throne in A.D. 1012. It begins with the kingâ€™s usual historical introduction commencing with the words Thiru manni valara, enumerates his conquests up to the capture of Kadram, is dated in the 18^(th) year of his reign and registers the extent of the *devadana* lands belonging to the temple of Mahadeva at Tirukkalar which is said to be a village in Purangarambai-nadu, a subdivision of Arumolideva-valanadu.

Compared with the inscription of this king found at Tirumalai[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_207_copper_plates_at_tirukkalar.html#_ftn3) dated in the 13^(th) year of reign and his Tanjore epigraph[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_207_copper_plates_at_tirukkalar.html#_ftn4), dated in the 19^(th) year of reign, the present inscription furnishes a few differences in reading which are noticed in foot-notes.

The identification of all the place names occurring in the historical introduction has been made by Professor Hultzsch[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_207_copper_plates_at_tirukkalar.html#_ftn5), and it remains to note here only a few facts in this connection.
Idaiturai-nadu which has been taken to be Yedatore, a small village in the Mysore district by Mr. Rice, has since been shown by Dr. Fleet to be identical with the territorial division Ededore, two thousand, a tract of country lying between the rivers Krishna on the north and Tungabhadra on the south, comprising a large part of the present Raichur district[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_207_copper_plates_at_tirukkalar.html#_ftn6).
The Kanyakumar inscription of Virarajendra shows that Mannaikadakkam is not to be identified with Manne in the Nelamangala taluk of the Bangalore district but is the same as Manyakheta, which Rajendra-Chola is said to have made a playground for his armies[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_207_copper_plates_at_tirukkalar.html#_ftn7)
Chakkara-kottam has been satisfactorily identified by Rai Bahadur Hira Lal with Chitrakuta or kota, eight miles from Rajapura in the Bastar State : he has also adduced epigraphical evidence to show that its king was really Dharavarsha in A.D. 1111[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_207_copper_plates_at_tirukkalar.html#_ftn8), as stated in the epigraphs of Kulottunga I.

 Dakshina-Ladam has been taken to be Dakshina-Virata or Southern Berars ; but it looks likely that it is identical with Dakshina-Radha in Bengal[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_207_copper_plates_at_tirukkalar.html#_ftn9).
Sri-Vijaya appears under the form Sri-Vishaya in a Kandiyur inscription[\[10\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_207_copper_plates_at_tirukkalar.html#_ftn10) of the same king ; and the large Leyden grant states that Maravijayotungavarman was the overlord of this territory[\[11\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_207_copper_plates_at_tirukkalar.html#_ftn11). This has been taken to be the same as San-fotsai of the Chinese annals and has been identified with Palembang, a residency of Sumatra[\[12\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_207_copper_plates_at_tirukkalar.html#_ftn12).

This land was inclusive of excess and deficiency (*in measurement*) of the surrounding parts.

**No. 208.â€” TIRUKKALAR PLATE OF RAJADHIRAJA I**

This inscription in six lines is engraved on the second plate of the Tirukkalar set. It is dated in the 31^(st) year of the reign of the Chola king Rajakesarivarman Rajadhiraja I and registers an arrangement made, by a certain Tirumanappichchan, who bore the double surname Araiyan Nagaraiyan and Mahipalakulakalapperaraiyan, whereby one Brahmin had to perform worship in the temple at Tirukkalar in addition to another who was doing that service till then. From the short
historical introduction which states that the king with the help of his army took the head of Vira-Pandya, Salai of the Chra king and Ilangai, it is clear that â€œSalai is an important place in the Chera dominions and not a feeding houseâ€? as the late Mr. T.A. Gopinatha Rao had taken to be.[\[13\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_207_copper_plates_at_tirukkalar.html#_ftn13)

In the 31^(st) year of (*the reign of*) king Rajakesarivarman *alias* Udaiyar Sri-Rajadhirajadeva, who, with his army, had taken the head of Vira-Pandya, Salai of the Chera king and Ilangai (*i.e.,* Ceylon), Araiyan Nagaraiyan *alias* Mahipalakulakalapperaraiyan *alias* Tirumanappichchan
