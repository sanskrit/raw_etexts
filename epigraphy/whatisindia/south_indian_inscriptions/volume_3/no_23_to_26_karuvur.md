**III.- Inscriptions in the Pasupatisvara temple at Karuvur**

No. 23 to 26 outside of the second prakara, left & right of entrance

[*No. 20 south wall of the Pasupatisvara temple*](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_20_karuvur.html)

[*No. 21 to 22 south wall of the shrine of the goddess*](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_21_to_22_karuvur.html)

**No. 23.- On the outside of the second Prakara, right of entrance**

This inscription is dated in the 23^(rd) year of the reign of *Tirubhuvanachakravartin* Kulottunga-Choladeva, who claims to have conquered Ilam (Ceylon), Madurai (Madura) and Karuvur and to have cut off the head of the Pandya king. The time of this Kulottunga-Chola is settled by an inscription in the Ranganayaka temple at Nellur (Nellore), which couples Saka-Samvat 1119 with the 19^(th) year of his reign.[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_23_to_26_karuvur.html#_ftn1) On the basis of this inscription and of some others which contain elements for astronomical calculation, Professor Kielhorn has shown that the kingâ€™s reign commenced between the 5^(th) June and 8^(th) July, A.D. 1178.[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_23_to_26_karuvur.html#_ftn2) Kulottunga-Choladeva I. ascended the throne in A.D. 1070,[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_23_to_26_karuvur.html#_ftn3) and Kulottunga-Choladeva II. issued the Chellur plates in A.D. 1132.[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_23_to_26_karuvur.html#_ftn4)
Consequently, the king, to whose reign the present inscription belongs, has to be designated Kulottunga-Choladeva III. In other inscriptions he hears the names Parakesarivarman, Virarajendradeva (II.) and Tribhuvanaviradeva. His latest date is the 39^(th) year in an unpublished inscription at Chidambaram. Accordingly, he must have been the immediate predecessor of *Tirubhuvanachakravartin* Rajarajadeva, who ascended the throne about A.D. 1216.[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_23_to_26_karuvur.html#_ftn5)

The immediate purpose of the subjoined inscription is to record that the king granted to the Karuvur temple the village of Mannarai and a portion of Keralapalli[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_23_to_26_karuvur.html#_ftn6).

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! In the twenty-third year (*of the reign*) of the emperor of the three worlds, Sri-Kulottunga-Soladeva, who was pleased to take Ilam, Madurai, the crowned head of the Pandya, and Karuvur, - the emperor of the three world, Koneri\[nmai\]kondan,[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_23_to_26_karuvur.html#_ftn7) (*addresses the following order*) to the Pujari (*devarkanmi*), to the overseers of the *Sri-Mahesvaras*, and to the manager of the temple of Tiruvanilai-Mahadeva at Karuvur *alias* Mudivalngu-Solapuram, (*city*) in Vengalanadu, (*a district*) of Kongu, *alias* Sola-Kerala-mandalam.

(L. 3.) â€œWe have given as temple land to (*the god*) Mahadeva of Tiruvanilai (*temple*) for the expenses required by this god (*the village of*) Mannarai, containing fifty *veli* of land in Kera\[la\]palli and in Mannarai in Tattaiyur-nadu, (*a district*) of the same *nadu*.[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_23_to_26_karuvur.html#_ftn8)

(L. 4.) â€œHaving declared that the land enclosed within the four great boundaries of this village, (*including*) the grass for the calves, and (*the land*) enjoyed in full by the great village, should be given to this god as tax-free temple land from the twenty-third (*year of our reign*), we have ordered (*our*) revenue officers[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_23_to_26_karuvur.html#_ftn9) to enter (*it*) as such in the account (*book*).

(L. 6.) â€œIf this land is (*actually*) taken possession of, you shall permit (*the temple authorities*) to take possession (*of it*) as tax-free temple land and to defray the expenses (*of the temple*) from (*the produce of*) these villages from the twenty-third (*year of our reign*), as determined by Keralan.â€?[\[10\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_23_to_26_karuvur.html#_ftn10)

**No. 24.- On the outside of the second Prakara, left of entrance**

This inscription is dated in the 25^(th) year of the reign of *Tribhuvanachakravarin* Kulottunga-Choladeva (III.), who receives here the same attributes as in No. 23. It records that the villagers of Tevanappalli sold some land to the temple for three *kalanju* of gold, which a hunter had paid into the temple treasury. This person was a native of Puvaniyam near Punnam in Vengala-nadu, a district of Sola-Kerala-mandalam. Tevanapalli belonged to Tattaiyur-nadu, another district of same *mandalam*. The land granted was bounded in the east by the village of Nombalur.

Punnam is found on the map of the Coimbatore district, about 6 miles west-nort-west from Maruvur. From inscriptions of Rajaraja I. and Rajendra-Chola I. on the walls of the small deserted temple of Somesvara at Somur near the junction of the Kaveri and Amaravati rivers, 7 miles east of Karuvur, it appears that Tevanappalli was the ancient name of Somur, and that the Somesvara temple belonged to Tirunombalur, a quarter or hamlet of Tevanappalli.

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! In the twenty-fifth year (*of the reign*) of the emperor of the three worlds, Sri-Kulottunga-Soladeva, who was pleased to take Ilam, Madurai, the crowned head of the Pandya, and Karuvur, - three *kalanju* of pure gold, weighed by the gold weight (*kasu-kal*),[\[11\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_23_to_26_karuvur.html#_ftn11) were paid into the treasury of the god of the Tiruvanilai (*temple*), (*who is*) the lord of Karuvur, *alias* Mudivalangu-Solapuram, (*a city*) in Vengala-nadu, (*a district*) of Sola-Kerala-mandalam, by Velan Kariyan, *alias* Marudanga-Velan, (*one*) of the hunters (*Vettuvar*) of Puvaniyam (*near*) Punnam, (*a village*) in the same *mandalam* (and) in the same *nadu*.

(L. 3.) We, the villagers of Tevanappalli in tattaiyur-nadu, (*a district*) of the same *mandalam*, have received these three *kalanju* of gold for the use of the village.

(L. 4.) Having received these three *kalanju* of gold from the sacred hand of the holy Chandesvaradeva, who is the first servant (*of* Siva),[\[12\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_23_to_26_karuvur.html#_ftn12) (*we*) sold as temple land one fortieth (*veli*), roughly, of land, which bears the name *padikappananjey[\[13\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_23_to_26_karuvur.html#_ftn13)*
(and) which is watered by the *Alodupoyi*\[*l*\] (*channel*) of the western fields.

(L. 5.) The boundaries of this (*land are*) : - The eastern boundary (*is*) to the west of the site of Nombalur ; the northern boundary (*is*) to the south of the *Vritti* ;[\[14\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_23_to_26_karuvur.html#_ftn14) the western boundar (*is*) to the east of the branch (*channel*) which flows towards the south ; and the southern boundary (*is*) to the north of the field of Anu\[kka\]-Nambi.

(L. 6.) This one fortieth (*veli*) of land, enclosed within these four great boundaries, shall belong to this god as temple land, free of taxes (*and*) to be enjoyed in full.

(L. 7.) We, the villagers, having fixed (?) and received all revenue, taxes, small tolls . . . . .. . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . (*and*) pounded rice due from this  
land, and having given this one fortieth (*veli*) of land as tax-free temple land, shall not be permitted to waste the good water, but shall use the dirty  
water for irrigation.
