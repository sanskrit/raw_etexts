**No. 203.â€” ON THE SAME WALL**[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_203_204_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn1)

The officer Sirringanudaiyan Parantaka Muvendavelan who has been mentioned in the previous records (Nos. 200 and 202) is stated to have enquired into the temple affairs and to have enhanced the scale of offerings from the unpaid balance of paddy collected from the assembly of Tiraimur which was a *devadana* village of the temple. The record belongs to the 4^(th) year and the 170^(th) day of the reign of Parakesarivarman who took the head of the Pandya king.

As shown in the *Madras Epigraphical Report* for 1916, page 118, paragraph 15, the days given after the regnal year of the king have to be taken as those that expired after the completion of that year.

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 4^(th) year and the 170^(th) day (*of the reign*) of king Parakesarivarman who took the head of the Pandya (*king*), the officer Sirringanudaiyan Koyilmayilai *alias* Parantaka-Muvendavelan examining in the front hall of the temple of the lord of Tiruvidaimarudil the sacred temple business of the lord of Tiruvidaimarudil heard the terms of the documents (r*elating*) to the *devadana* and *brahmadeya* (*village*) Tiraimur which was a *devadana* of the lord of Tiruvidaimarudil, and found out that the *devadana* of Tiraimur was stated in the documents to be a *kudinikki* village (*i.e.,* one freed from tenancy rights) and that the *devadana-brahmadeya* village of Tiraimur according to the (*above*) documents had to measure out two hundred and fifty-six *kalam* of *panchavdra* paddy. (*But*) hearing the *padimarru* (*customary scale*) of expenses of the temple (*he*) found that for the *padimarru* only one hundred and sixty *kalam* (*of paddy*) was being measured out. Also (*it was asserted*) that the *devadana* (*village*) Tiraimur of 20 *veli* was not a *kudinikki* and that only eight hundred *kalam* (*of paddy*) were being measured. He then asked the (*original*) document which made Tiraimur into a *devadana* (*village*) to be produced (*before him*), heard it (*and found*) in this document that (*the village*) was stated to be *kudinikk9* (*i.e.,* freed from tenancy rights)

and that this land of 20 *veli*, according to the deed .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .in the 3^(rd) year (*of the reign*) of this same (*king*), (*was to have measured out*) two thousand and eight hundred *kalam* of paddy by the measure (*called*) *Tiruvidaimarudan* according to the deed of contract (*adai-olai*). Since (*thus*) the assembly of Tiraimur, the *devedana-brahmadeya* (*village*) of this god, has been measuring out one hundred and sixty *kalam* only of *panchavara* paddy in the past while, according to the document examined, it is found that two hundred and fifty-six *kalam* of paddy have to be measured out (*under this head*), the thus (*accumulated balance*)[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_203_204_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn2) was converted into a capital and after hearing the existing scale of expenses in presence of this god, it was ordered that a higher scale of expenses (*may be adopted*). (*The following*) is the list of current daily expenses, drawn up according to the (*increased*) scale, . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . of Tiraimur and the merchants (*nagarattar*) of Tiruvidaimarudil being present, under the orders of the officer Sirringanudaiyan Koyil Mayilai *alias* Parantaka-Muvendavelan who scrutinizes the sacred temple business.

(L. 4.) Twelve *nali* of pounded rice of superior paddy for the sacred rice-offering to the god in the early morning ; fifteen *nali* for the sacred rice-officering at midday ; and one *nali* \[of rice\]for the *bali* at midday ; twelve *nali* for the sacred rice-offering in the night and \[one *nali*\] of rice for the *bali* at night ; eight
measures for the sacred rice-offering at midnight. To (*the god*) Pillaiyar Ganapati, two measures for the sacred rice-offering in the early morning ; two measures for the sacred rice-offering at midday ; thus in all . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . fifty-three *nali* for the \[sacred\] rice-offering . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . and (*one*) *tuni,* (*one*) *padakku* and five *nali* of rice . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . four *nali* and one *uri* daily of good *dhall* and one *uri* of *dhall* for Pillaiyar. The sundry spices (*required*) every day (*were*) : (*one*) *alakku* of pepper and (*one*) *ulakku* of mustard; the daily vegetable-offering[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_203_204_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn3) (*consisted of*) one *kaykkari-amudu*, one *pulingari-amudu* and (*one*) *porikkari-amudu*; four and a half *palam* of sugar-offering daily; twenty plantain fruits every day ; (*one*) *nali* and (*one*) *uri* of ghee offering daily ; eight *nali* of curd offering daily ; a daily offering of eighty areca-nuts; three *parru* of choice betel-leaf offering; chunam (*nirru*) offering ; and salt-offering. This is how the scale of expenses was drawn up. May this be under the protection of all *Mahesvaras* as long as the moon and the sun (*endure*) !

**No. 204.â€” ON THE NORTH WALL OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE IN THE NAGESVARASVAMIN TEMPLE AT KUMBAKONAM**[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_203_204_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn4)

This is dated in the 5^(th) year of Parakesarivarman who took the head of the Pandya king and records a gift of gold by a female-servant of the palace, who, was living in the quarter of tanjavur called Palaiya-velam, for feeding a *sivayogin* in the temple of Tirukkil-kottam in Tirukkudamukkil. The names Tirukkudamukkil and Tirukkil-kottam occur in the *Devaram* and refer respectively to Kumbakonam and the Nagesvara temple. *Sivayogin* is a technical term and is explained in a recent commentary on the *Kriyakramadyotika* as the name of a Saiva worshipper who â€œat the approach of death bathes his body in ashes, utters certain Saiva *mantras* and worships the *linga* on his chest.â€?

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 5^(th) year (*of the reign*) of king Parakesarivarman who took the head of the Pandya (*king*), Perayan Tribhuvanasundari, a palace-woman (*pendatti*) (*living*) in the (*quarter called)* Palaiya-velam at Tanjavur in Tanjavur-kurram, deposited 85 (*pieces*) of superfine gold for feeding (*a sivayogin*) with one plate of sumptuous meal in the temple of the great lord of Tirukkil-kottam at Tirukkudamukkil, a *devadana* (*village*) in Vadagarai Pambur-nadu.

(L. 8.) For this (*gold*), we, the big men of the *mulaparudai* (*assembly*), sold to this lady the land in melkaviri which we had acquired as *abhishekadakshina* and had (*already*) sold to this god.

(L. 13.) This six *ma* of cultivable land whose eastern boundary was to the west of the land granted for a lamp by Kadan Achchan, to the north of the land of this same god, to the east of the land of this same god and to the south of the demarcation ridge in the tank, â€” this six *ma* of cultivable land thus (*marked out*) shall be utilized for feeding, till the moon and the sun (*endure*), one *Sivayogin* with five vegetables, one *pidi* of ghee, plantain fruits, and curds sweetened with sugar.

The original text has evidently omitted to mention here the other discrepancy, *viz.,* that of measuring sight hundred *kalam* (as landlordâ€™s share ?) instead of 2,800 according to the *adai-olai*.
The accumulated balance of this also should have been treated as capital.
