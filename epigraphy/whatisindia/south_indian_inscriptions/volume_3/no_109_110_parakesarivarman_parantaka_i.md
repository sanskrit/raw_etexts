[*No. 95 to 97 Abhiramesvara shrine, Chandra sekhara temple, cave at tirumalai*](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/parakesarivarman_parantaka_i.html)

[*No. 98 to 100 Ujjivanathasvamin, Kharapurisvara, Madhuvanesvara temples*](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_98_100_parakesarivarman_parantaka_i.html)

[*No. 101 to 105 Melaikkoyil, Madhuvanesvara, Adhipurisvara temples*](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_101_105_parakesarivarman_parantaka_i.html)

[*No. 106 to 108 Narasingapperumal, Sivayoganathasvamin temples*](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_106_108_parakesarivarman_parantaka_i.html)



**No. 109.â€” ON THE NORTH WALL OF THE LAKSHMINARAYANA-PERUMAL TEMPLE AT SINNAMANUR**[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_109_110_parakesarivarman_parantaka_i.html#_ftn1)

The inscription is dated in the 36^(th) year of Parakesarivarman and is much damaged. It is written in the Vatteluttu alphabet and registers a gift of a lamp to the temple of Tirunaduvur \[in\]Arukesarinallur (*which was the ancient name of Sinnamanur*), a *brahmadeya* in Ala-nadu. The high regnal year points to the king being identical with Parantaka I. If this is the case, an inscription of Parantaka I. so far to the south of Madura deserves to be noted.

Hail ! Prosperity ! The 36^(th) year of (*the reign of*) king Parakesarivarman. In this year . . . . . . . . . . per day for the ghee (*which is required*) for (*one*) sacred lamp to the god (*bhatara*)of Tirunaduvur in Arukesarinallur, a *brahmadeya* of Ala-nadu, by Tiruchchedi Irasadi, on behalf of his son Irasadi Solai.

**No. 110.â€” ON THE SOUTH WALL OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE IN THE MADHUVANESVARA TEMPLE AT TIRUKKALAVUR**[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_109_110_parakesarivarman_parantaka_i.html#_ftn2)

This record which is dated in the 39^(th) year of Parakesarivarman (Parantaka I.) â€˜who took Madirai and Ilamâ€™ registers a gift of land by a maid-servant of queen Villavan-Mahadeviyar. The recipient of the gift is not mentioned but must be the Siva temple of Tirumullainatha at Tirukkalavur, on whose wall the inscription is engraved.

Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 39^(th) year of (*the reign of*) king parakesarivarman, who took Madirai (Madura) and Ilam (*Ceylon*), we, the members of the assembly (*paradai*) of Karugavur near (*pal*) Tirukkudamukkil which was a *devadana* in Vadagarai Pambur-nadu (*received*) one quarter (*of*) Palmutti (*land*) with a tank dug (*in it*) which Nakkan Vikramabharani, a palace maid-servant (*pendatti*) of queen Villavan-Mahadeviyar, had purchased from Vaikundan Pandan of Korrangudi, one of the landlords of this village. Converting (*the tank*) into an *iraikulam,* we, the members of the assembly had this land cultivated *(on the terms)* two to one[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_109_110_parakesarivarman_parantaka_i.html#_ftn3), obtaining in this village ; charged the tax of[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_109_110_parakesarivarman_parantaka_i.html#_ftn4) . . . . . . . . . . one-eighth *sey* to the village and charged (*the tax on the remaining*) one-eighth of this land to the members of the assembly and receiving in our hands this (5) five *kalanju* of gold for this land (*from her*), made this land tax-free as long as the moon and the sun (*exist*) and got (*this deed*) engraved on stone. If we fail (*to act according to*) this (*decision*), we, (*the members*) of the assembly ourselves shall pay a fine of 100 *kalanju* of gold and shall (*also*) cause to be paid a fine of 50 *kalanju* of gold by each of the persons who individually obstruct (*this order*). Even then (*i.e., even after paying the fine*) we, the members of the assembly, shall have this one-fourth *sey* engraved on stone as tax-free (*land*) imposing (*the taxes of*) this one-fourth *sey* of tax-free land on the village and paying the taxes ourselves. The sacred feet of those who protect this charity shall be on our heads. (*The assembly of*) all *Mahesvaras* and the great men of all *Mahesvaras* shall protect (*this charity*).[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_109_110_parakesarivarman_parantaka_i.html#_ftn5)

Here is a reference evidently to a system of contract by which two shares of the produce were assigned to the landlord and one to the cultivator or *vice versa*.

The symbols used here for land measurement are not intelligible. If they are taken to denote 1/8^(th) sey of land immediately after, we find the same 1/8^(th) as explained represented by a different group of symbols lower down.

The *Mahesvaras* and *Mahesvarapperumakkal* may denote different bodies. The latter may be lay disciples of the former.
