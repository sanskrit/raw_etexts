**No. 31.- On the west wall of the mandapa in the Rajagopala-Perumal temple**

This inscription belongs to the 48^(th) year of the reign of Rajakesarivarman, *alias* Kulottunga-Choladeva (I.), and opens with the same introduction as two inscription as two inscriptions at Kanchi, which I have published in Vol. II. (Nos. 77 and 78). It is dated on a week-day (1. 8) which, according to Professor Kielhornâ€™s calculation,[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_31_to_33_manimangalam.html#_ftn1) corresponds to Friday, the 25^(th) January A.D. 1118. On this day a private person purchased from several other persons 1,050 *kuli* of land near the village and granted them to the temple, with the condition that the produce of the land might be used for defraying the cost of processions of new-moon days.

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 48^(th) year (*of the reign*) of king Rajakesarivarman, *alias* the emperor of the three worlds, Sri-Kulottunga-Soladeva, who,- while the goddess of fame became renowned (*through him*), while the goddess of victory was coveting (*him*), while the goddess of the earth became brilliant (*with joy*), (*and*) while the goddess with the (*lotus*) flower (*i.e.,* Lakshmi) wedded (*him*), - had put on by right of inheritance the excellent crown of jewels ; who had caused the wheel of his (*authority*) to roll over all regions, so that the Minavar (*pandyas*) lost (*their*) firmness, the Villavar (*Cheras*) trembled, (*and*) the other kings were defeated the suffered disgrace ; and who, having anointed himself (*in commemoration of his*) victories, was graciously seated on the throne of heroes in union with (*his queen*) Ulagudaiyal.[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_31_to_33_manimangalam.html#_ftn2)

**No. 32â€“ On the south wall of the mandapa in the Rajagopala-Perumal temple**

This inscription is mutilated at the end. It records the purchase of some land near the village, the produce of which was assigned to the temple for providing offerings. The name of the purchaser and donor was Viravali Tiruvarangam-udaiyan Sahasran, and the two temple managers at the time of the purchase were Kesava-Bhattan of Allur and Tiruvaykkula-Pittan of Aranaippuram. As the same three persons are mentioned in the preceding inscription (No. 31), which belongs to the reign of Kulottunga I., it follows that the subjoined inscription, which is dated in the 48^(th) year of *Tribhuvanachakravartin*
Kulottunga-Choladeva, has to be assigned also to Kulottunga I.

(Line 1.) Hail! Prosperity! In the 48^(th) year (of the reign) of the emperor of the three worlds, Sri-Kulottunga-Soladeva, on the day of Satabhishaj*,* which corresponded to a Friday and to the twelfth tithi[\[11\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_31_to_33_manimangalam.html#_ftn11) of the first fortnight of the month of *Kumbha*.

(L. 2.) The writing of the great assembly of Manimangalam, *alias* Pandiyanai-irumadi-ven-kanda-Sola-valanadu, (a district) of Jayankonda-Sola-mandalam.

(L. 3.) With the knowledge of Kesava-Bhattan of \[Alu\]r and Tiruvaykkula-Alvar, which is the temple in the middle of our village.
