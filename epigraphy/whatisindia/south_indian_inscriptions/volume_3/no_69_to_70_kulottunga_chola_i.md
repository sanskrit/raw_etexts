**No. 69.- Inscription at Tirukkalukkunram.**

This inscription (No. 174 of 1894) is engraved on the wall of the strong-room of the Vedagirisvara temple at Tirukkalukkunram, a large village in the Chingleput district on the road from Chngleput to the port of Madras.[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_69_to_70_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn1)
This village is mentioned in Sundaramurtiâ€™s *Devaram* as Kalukkunram, â€˜the hill of the kites.â€™ The ancient name of the temple was Mulasthana.[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_69_to_70_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn2)
Tirukkalukkunram itself bore the surname Ulagalanda-Solapuram and belonged to Kalattur-nadu, a subdivision of the district of Kalattur-kottam. The names of this district and of its subdivision are derived from Kalattur, a village on the south of Chingleput.[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_69_to_70_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn3)

The inscription records the grant of two lamps, made in the 14^(th) and 15^(th) years of the reign of Kulottunga I. (II. 32 and 38). The historical introduction agrees on the whole with that of No. 68 as far as line 11. It then relates that Kulottunga I. drove Vikkalan (*i.e.,* Vikramaditya VI.) from nangili (in the Kolar district)[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_69_to_70_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn4) by way of Manalur[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_69_to_70_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn5) to the Tungabhadra river, and that he conquered the Ganga-mandalam and Singanam, by which the dominions of Jayasimha III. seem to be meant.[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_69_to_70_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn6)
Having secured his frontiers in the north, he turned against the Pandyas[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_69_to_70_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn7) and subdued the south-western portion of the peninsula as far as the Gulf of Mannar, the Podiyil mountain (in the Tinnevelly district), Cape Comorin, Kottaru, the Sahya (*i.e.,* the Western Ghats) and Kudamalai-nadu (*i.e.,* Malabar). From the statement that he â€œfixed the boundary of the Southern countryâ€? (1. 27), it may be concluded that he limited the territories of the Pandya king to the Madura district. In order to pacify the newly acquired country, he settled some of his officers on the roads passing through Kottaru, *etc.* An inscription of the 39^(th) year of his reign at Cholapuram, a portion of Kottaru (No. 46 of 1896), actually mentions one of those military settlers.

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! While the wheel of his (*authority*) went as far as the golden circle (*i.e.,* Mount Meru) on the earth, which was surrounded by the moat of the sea, that was (*again*) surrounded by (*his*) fame, (*the king*) newly wedded, in the time (*when he was still*) heir-apparent, the brilliant goddess of victory at sakkarakottam by deeds of valour and seized a herd of mountains of rut (*i.e.,* rutting elephants) at Vayiragaram.

(Line 3.) (*He*) unsheathed (*his*) sword, showed the strength of (his) arm, and spurred (*his*) war-steed, so that the army of the king of Kondala, (*whose spear had*) a sharp point, retreated.

(L. 4.) Having established (*his*) fame, having put on the garland of (*the victory over*) the Northern region, and having stopped the prostitution of the goddess with the sweet and excellent lotus-flower (*i.e.,* Lakshmi) of the Southern region, and the loneliness of the goddess of the good country whose garment is the Ponni, (*he*) put on by right (*of inheritance*) the pure royal crown of jewels, while the kings of the earth bore his two feet (*on their heads*) as a large crown.

(L. 6.) The river (*of the rules*) of the ancient king Manu swelled, (*and*) the river (*of the sins*) of the Kali (*age*) dried up.

(L. 7.) (*His*) sceptre swayed over every (*quarter of*) this continent of the *naval* (tree) ; the white light of the sacred shadow of (*his*) white parasol shone everywhere on the circle of the great earth ; (*and his*) tiger (-*banner*) fluttered unrivalled on the Meru (*mountain*).

(L. 9.) (*Before him*) stood a row of elephants showering jewels, which were presented (*as*) tribute by the king of remote islands whose girdle is the sea.

(L. 10.) The excellent head of the refractory king of the South (*i.e.,* the Pandya) lay outside his (*viz.,* Kulottungaâ€™s) beautiful city, being pecked by kites.

(L. 11.) Not only did the speech (of Vikkalan) : - â€œAfter this day a permanent blemish (*will attach to* Kulottunga), as to the crescent[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_69_to_70_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn8) (*which is the origin*) of (*his*) family,â€?[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_69_to_70_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn9) â€“ turn out wrong, but the bow (*in*) the hand of Vikkalan was not (even) bent against (*the enemy*).

(L. 13.) Everywhere from Nangili of rocky roads â€“ with Manalur in the middle â€“ to the Tungabhadra, there were lying low the dead (*bodies of his*) furious elephants, his lost pride and (his) boasted valour.

(L. 14.) The very mountains which (*he*) ascended bent their backs ; the very rivers into which (*he*) descended eddied and breached (*the banks*) in their course ; (*and*) the very seas into which (*he*) plunge became troubled and agitated.

(L. 16.) (*The Chola king*) seized simultaneously the two countries (*pani*) called Gangamandalam and Singanam, troops of furious elephants which had been irretrievably abandoned (*by the* *enemy*), crowds of women, (*the angles of*) whose beautiful eyes were as pointed as daggers, the goddess of fame, who gladly brought disgrace (*on Vikkalan*), himself and (*his*) father, who were desirous of the rule over the Western region, to turn their backs again and again on many days.

(L. 20.) Having resolved in (*his*) royal mind to conquer also the Pandi-mandalam (*i.e.,* the Pandya country) with great fame, (*he*) dispatched his great army, - which possessed \[excellent horses (*resembling*) the waves of the sea\], war-elephants (*resembling*) ships, and troops (*resembling*) water, - as though the Northern ocean was overflowing the Southern ocean.

(L. 22.) (*He*) completely destroyed the forest which the five Panchavas (*i.e.,* Pandyas) had entered as refuge, when they were routed on a battlefield where (*he*) fought (*with them*), and fled cowering with fear.

(L. 24.) (*He*) subdued (*their*) country, drove them into hot jungles (*in*) hills where woodmen roamed about, and planted pillars of victory in every region.

(L. 25.) (*He*) was pleased to seize the pearl fisheries,[\[10\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_69_to_70_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn10) the Podiyil (*mountain*) where the three kinds of Tamil (f*lourished*),[\[11\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_69_to_70_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn11) \[the (*very*) centre of the (*mountain*) Saiyam[\[12\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_69_to_70_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn12)\] where furious rutting elephants were captured, and Kanni,[\[13\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_69_to_70_kulottunga_chola_i.html#_ftn13) and fixed the boundaries of the Southern (*i.e.,* Pandya) country.
