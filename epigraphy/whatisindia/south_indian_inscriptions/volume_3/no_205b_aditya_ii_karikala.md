**Translation of the Sanskrit text**

(Verse 1.) May bashful Bhavani (*Parvati*) who, seeing her (*own*) from (*reflected*) in the gem on the hood of the king of serpents (*which forms*) the necklace of Srikantha (*Siva*), (*and*) (*suspecting*) it (*to be*) another woman, looks askance, excited and jealous, at her husband who, with a heart all-desirous of (*her*) embrace, prays (*for it*) bowing at (*her*) feet, grant you uninterrupted prosperity!

(V. 2.) May that pond in which the royal swan of heroism sports ; the sun (*which delights*) the lotuses (*viz.,)* the learned ; the sole caravan-leader of the vast crowd of travelers on the two routes (*viz.,)* (*the temporal*), where the results (*of actions*) are seen, and (*the transcendental*), where the results are not seen ; the supreme ruler of all royal races ; the ocean where the multitude of gems *(viz.,)* all virtues, has its birth ; â€” the Chola family â€” rule for ever the circle of the earth, redressing the grievances of all !

(V. 3.) The letters (*of the alphabet*) limited in number are only fifty ; (*whereas*) the virtues of (the kings of) the Solar race are resplendent beyond number. How can I describe these (virtues) with those (*letters*) ? Oh ! Mother Sarasvati ! secure for me (*the help of*) other letters (*lipi*) (*also*)[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_205b_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn1).

(V. 4.) The eye of the three worlds was the Sun[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_205b_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn2) from whom sprang the sprouts of all (*families of*) kings. From him (*i.e.,* the Sun) was born by concentration (*manana*), Manu,[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_205b_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn3) the first of kings whose name became (*thus*) conformable to (*its*) meaning.

(V. 5.) Great Ikshvaku[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_205b_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn4) was born (*as*) his son ; of him, in great battles the enemies of gods (i.e., *the danavas*) were greatly afraid. The three worlds, though completely immersed I the ocean of his spotless fame, (*still*) enjoyed extreme delight.[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_205b_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn5)

(V. 6.) (*Then*) came forth his son, the heroic Vikukshi,[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_205b_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn6) who was the husband of the youthful Earth adorned by the girdle (*viz.,)* the waves of all (*surrounding*) oceans, (*and*) whose lotus feet were resplendent by the luster (*proceeding from*) the diadems of many crowds of bowing kings.

(V. 7.) To him was born as son the king named Puranjaya, whose abundant prowess and heroism were well known and the expansive white parasol of whose blooming fame, having spread over the whole surface of the entire universe, was (*still found to be*) in excess.

(V. 5.) Great Ikshvaku[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_205b_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn7) was born (*as*) his son ; of him, in great battles the enemies of gods (i.e., *the danavas*) were greatly afraid. The three worlds, though completely immersed I the ocean of his spotless fame, (*still*) enjoyed extreme delight.[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_205b_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn8)

(V. 8.) This mine of prowess, because (*he*) sat upon the hump of Hari (i.e., Indra) who had assumed the form of a bull, (*and*) killed in battle the warriors of the enemies of gods, bore on this account the name Kakutstha[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_205b_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn9) (*i.e.,* one who sits on the hump).

(V. 9.) (*People)* say that his son Kakshivat was a king of unopposed power, whose fame was sung by the celestial singers (*gandharva*) in the houses of gods ; and the light of the moon (*viz*.,) the reflection of his spotless white parasol, extinguished the fatigue (*of the people*) on the surface of (*this*) earth.[\[10\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_205b_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn10)

(V. 10.) His son was Aryyama, the lord of the earth, who obtained the Lakshmi (*of victory*) by stirring the ocean of his enemy (*forces*) with the churning rod of his mountain (*like*) arm ; (and) whose greatness was pre-eminently extolled.

(V. 11.) In his family was born the king (*named*) Analapratapa, whose magnanimity was well known in the world, and the fire of whose prowess sprang forth from his tree (*like*) shoulders[\[11\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_205b_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn11) rubbing against the bow-string, and destroyed (*his*) enemies.

(V. 12.) The full-moon (*in swelling*) the ocean of his (*i.e.,* Analapratapaâ€™s) family was Vena, the foremost of kings. His son was king Prithu, whose prosperity was great, who was the chief of rulers, (*and*) who, like heroism incarnate for putting down injustice (*in this world*), came forth (*clad*) in mail, wearing a diadem of gems and holding a bow of matchless strength[\[12\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_205b_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn12) with the string (*drawn)* and the arrow (*set*) from Venaâ€™s right arm which was churned (*for that purpose*) by chiefs of ascetics.

(V. 14.) In this family was born a king who, having killed the demon Dhundhu of enormous strength, (*bore*) on earth the name Dhundhumara.[\[13\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_205b_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn13) This king also (*having become*) the sole resort of virtues, ruled the whole earth.

(V. 15.) In that family was born king Yuvanasva[\[14\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_205b_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn14) who had no second (*to him*) in austerity, celebrity, truth and (*other*) good qualities ; all people well understood his prowess to be a rampart-wall in protecting the whole world, ever increasing on all sides.

(V. 16.) The son of that (*king*), whose greatness was widespread (*and*) who was respected by *(those*) who were (*themselves*) deserving of respect, was Mandhatri,[\[15\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_205b_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn15) the master of courage, wisdom, love, prosperity and learning. (*He*), the birth-place of mercy, ruled for a long time the earth as far as the Lokaloka mountain[\[16\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_205b_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn16) as (*if he were*) the embodiment of the protective power itself.

(V. 17.) Begotten (of him) was his son (known as) king Muchukunda,[\[17\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_205b_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn17) who kept himself awake in the duty of protecting the camp of the army of gods which was attacked by the forces of powerful demons ; who was engrossed in the sleep obtained (*as boon*) through the grace of the lord of gods (*i.e.,* Indra) and whose eyes, opening in anger, immediately consumed the crafty demon Kalayavana and (*thus*) pleased Mukunda (*Vishnu*).

(V. 18.) In that family was also born he of immense prosperity who was a store-house of celebrated heroism, whose name was known (*to the world*) as Valabha, who offered up (*his*) enemies as moths to the flames of (*his*) arrows and founded (*the city of*) Valabhi.

(V. 19.) To him was born (*the king*) named Prithulaksha,[\[18\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_205b_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn18) who, at request of crowds of gods and demons, set whirling in the ocean the huge mountain Mandara for (*the purpose of*) securing nectar.

(V. 20.) To him was born a son (*known as*) parthivachudamani, who was a mine of power and who, while Mukunda (*Vishnu*) was giving the gods a drink of nectar, destroyed the army of the demons (*who were disturbing*).

(V. 21.) Dirghabahu, the foremost of the virtuous and a jewel of that race, then became the paramount sovereign. Learned men say that the *fire* of his prowess *quenched* the grievances of the virtuous.[\[19\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_205b_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn19)

(V. 22.) He, king Chandrajit, the parental home of the goddess of victory, conquered the unconquerable army of the enemies of gods and (*also*) the Moon who had carried away the wife of his teacher (*Brihaspati*).

(V. 23.) His son Samkriti became the emperor at the close of the Krita age. That he highly *reddened* (*i.e*., pleased) the earth with the (*white)* rays of the moon of (*his*) fame is (*indeed*) strange.

(V. 24.) A jewel in that family was the king known as Panchapa the victorious, who, by the excellence of his body, surpassed the five-arrowed  
(*Cupid*) and vied (*in prosperity*) with the lord of the heaven (*i.e.,* Indra).
