**No. 171.â€” ON THE SOUTH WALL OF THE SUBRAHMANYA TEMPLE AT UTTARAMALLUR**[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_171_176_parthivendravarman.html#_ftn1)

This record is dated in the 4^(th) year of Parthivedradhipativarman who took the head of Vira-Pandya and registers a gift of land to the temple of Subrahmanya-bhattara at Uttarameru-chaturvedimangalam by Sandiran Elunurruvan *alias* Nulamba Mayilatti, a merchant of Ranavirappadi in Kanchipura. Ranavirappadi is already known from the Madras Museum plates of Uttama-Chola to have been a hamlet of Kanchipura (*Conjeeveram*). The donor is mentioned in other inscriptions of Uttaramallur in connexion with several other charities in that place.

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 4^(th) year of (*the reign of*) Parthivendradhipativarman who took the head of Vira-Pandya, (*this is*) the writing of us (*the members*) of the great assembly of Uttarameru-chaturvedimangalam, (*a village*) in its own subdivision in Kaliyur-kottam : â€” The land which Sandiran Elunurruvan *alias* Nulamba Mayilatti, a merchant of Ranavirappadi in Kanchipura, purchased from us and granted as *sribalibhoga* for sounding *sribali* (*in the temple of*) Subrahmanya-bhattara of our village (*is what follows*) : â€” 240 *kuli* of third rate (*land*) in the first *sadukkam*, east of (*the path called*) Marapidugu-vadi of the thirteenth *kannaru*, north of (*the channel called*) Sridevi-vaykkal; in the same place 540 (*kuli*) of fourth rate (*land*) and in the same place 180 (*kuli*) of sixth rate (*land*)

(L. 3.) We shall not enter against these lands (*in our books*) any kind of assessment *echchoru, amanji, vetti,* etc. We (*the members of*) the big assembly unanimously give our consent to collect a fine of twenty *kalanju* of gold in the court of justice from those who obstruct this (*charity*) and declare that (*those who deviate from this*) shall incur the sins committed by sinners (*in the land*) between Ganga and Kumari.

(L. 5.) The land given by this (*same*) person for (*the ceremony connected with*) waking up the image from bed (*palli-eluchchi*) (*is*) : â€” Seven hundred and twenty *kuli* (*comprised*) of three *padagam* in the first and sixth squares north of (*the channel*) Sarasvativaykkal of the second *kannaru,* west of (*the path called*) Paramesvara-vadi.
We (*the members*) of the assembly exempted (*this land*) from taxes and had the (*gift deed*) written on stone.

**No. 172.â€” ON THE NORTH WALL OF THE VAIKUNTHA-PERUMAL TEMPLE AT UTTARAMALLUR**[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_171_176_parthivendravarman.html#_ftn2)

This inscription records that in the 4^(th) year of king Parthivedradhipativarman who took the head of the Pandya (king), a gift of land was made by a merchant for offerings to the image of Ganapati, in the temple of (the goddess) Konerinangai at Kumanpadi, a hamlet of Uttarameru-chaturvedimangalam.

Hail! Prosperity! In the 4^(th) year of (*the reign of*) Parthivendradhipativarman who took the head of the Pandya (*king*), (*this is*) \[the wiring\] of us (*the members*) of the great assembly of Uttarameru-chaturvedimangalam, (*a village*) in its own subdivision in Kaliyur-kottam. (*the following is*) the land given by a merchant . . . . . . . . . . . . . . of the south bazaar for \[sacred\] offerings to (*the god*) Ganapati in the temple of (*the goddess*) Konerinangai at Kumanpadi of our village :â€” 180 *kuli* of first rate (*land*) in the fourth *sadukkam* to the east of (*the path called*) Paramesvara-vadi of the fourth *kannaru*, south of the village.

**No. 173.â€” ON THE NORTH WALL OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE IN THE JALANATHESVARA TEMPLE AT TAKKOLAM**[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_171_176_parthivendravarman.html#_ftn3)

This record registers a gift of 96 sheep for burning a perpetual lamp near the goddess Durga-Bhatari in the temple of Tiruvural-Alvar at Takkolam in the 4th year of Parthivendravarman, by a native of Marayapadi. The latter territorial division also called Maharajappadi or Marjavadi comprised the eastern portion of the Kolar district and parts of the Cuddapah and Chittoor districts.

Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 4th year of (the reign of) king Parthivendravarman, Kesuvaiyan alias Pallavan Brahmadarayan, son of Talakottigamundasvami of Marayapadi, gave 96 sheep for one perpetual lamp to (the goddess) Durga-Bhatari who is pleased to stand in the temple of Tiruvural-Alvar at Takkolam. I, Kumaran alias Vironukka Manradi, son of Madhurantaka Kaduttalai Manradi, shall measure out the ghee of these (sheep).

**No. 174.â€” ON THE SLAB BUILT INTO THE FLOOR OF THE MANDAPA IN FRONT OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE OF THE MASILA-MANISVARA TEMPLE AT TIRUMULLAIVAYIL**[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_171_176_parthivendravarman.html#_ftn4)

This fragmentary record is of special interest as it is written in archaic Tamil characters. It refers to Kalikesari-chaturvedimangalam, a devadana village in Pulalkottam, which may probably be the surname of Tirumullaivayil where the inscription is found. The king Parthivendravarman mentioned here is also perhaps different from and earlier than the Parthivendradhipativarman to whom the records of this group belong.

Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 5th year of (the reign of) king Parthivendravarman, (the following) is the sale deed (vilai kaieluzhuthu) of us (the members) of the assembly of Kalikesari-chaturvedimangalam, a devadana in its (own) subdivision (kuru) in Pular-kottam. . . . . . . . . . . . . .
