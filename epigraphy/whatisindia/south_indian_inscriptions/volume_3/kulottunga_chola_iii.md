[*No. 85 to 86 Inscription at Tirumanikuli & Chidambaram*](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_85_to_86_kulottunga_chola_iii.html)

[*No. 87 to 88 Inscription at Chidambaram & Srirangam*](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_87_to_88_kulottunga_chola_iii.html)

As I have stated on page 43 above, the time of Kulottunga-Chola III., the immediate predecessor of Rajaraja III., is settled by an inscription at Nellore, which couples Saka-Samvat 1119 with the 19^(th) year of his reign. Professor Kielhornâ€™s calculations of the dates of twenty inscriptions of this king have shown that his reign commenced between the 8^(th) June and 8^(th) July A.D. 1178.[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_iii.html#_ftn1)

The records of the reign of Kulottunga III. are so numerous that a complete list of them would occupy too much space. I subjoin a list of those opening with a historical introduction, the first word of which is puyal.

In the majority of these inscriptions (Nos. 1, 4, 5, 7 to 10) the king is called Parakesarivarman *alias* *Tirubhuvanachakravartin* Kulottunga-Choladeva. Two inscriptions (Nos. 2 and 3) substitute Virarajendradeva (II.) for Kulottunga-Choladeva, and the two remaining inscriptions (Nos. 6 and 11) have instead of it Konerimenkondan[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_iii.html#_ftn6) and Tribhuvanaviradeva, respectively. In his inscriptions without historical introduction, the king is called either Kulottunga-Choladeva or Tribhuvanaviradeva. The second name occurs in records of the 27^(th) to 37^(th) years.[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_iii.html#_ftn7) In a single inscription the king bears the name Virarajendra-Choladeva.[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_iii.html#_ftn8)

Two inscriptions of the 9^(th) year[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_iii.html#_ftn9) prefix to the name of the king the relative sentence â€˜who was pleased to take Madurai.â€™ In records of the 10^(th) to 31^(st) years, this sentence is amplified into â€˜who, having taken Madurai, was pleased to take the crowned head of the Pandya.â€™[\[10\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_iii.html#_ftn10)
Other inscriptions, of the 12^(th) to 29^(th) years, read â€˜who, having taken Madurai and Ilam, was pleased to take also the crowned head of the Pandya.â€™ An inscription of the 14^(th) year[\[11\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_iii.html#_ftn11) has â€˜who was pleased to take Madurai and Ilam.â€™ In inscriptions of the 23^(rd) to 31^(st) years, we find â€˜who was pleased to take Ilam, Madurai, the crowned head of the Pandya, and Karuvur.â€™ Finally, certain inscriptions of the 31^(st) to 37^(th) years add to the kingâ€™s conquests, that he â€˜was pleased to perform the anointment of heroes and the anointment of victors :â€™

The introductions of the inscriptions of the 3^(rd), 5^(th) and 8^(th) years[\[12\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_iii.html#_ftn12) do not contain any statement of historical interest. An inscription of the 9^(th) year (No. 86 below) relates that Kulottunga III. assisted Vikrama-Pandya against the son of Vira-Pandya, defeated the Mara (*i.e.,* Marava ?) army,[\[13\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_iii.html#_ftn13) drove the Simhala army into the sea, took Madurai (*i.e.,* Madhura) from Vira-Pandya and bestowed it on (Vikrama) Pandya. An inscription of the 11^(th) year (No. 87 below) also refers to the defeat of the son of Vira-Pandya and to the bestowal of Kudal (*i.e.,* Madhura) on Vikrama-Pandya, and adds that Vira-Pandya revolted again, but that Kulottunga III. â€˜took his crowned head,â€™ *i.e.,* that, while seated on the throne, he placed his feet on the crown of the Pandya king. An inscription of the 19^(th) year (No. 88 below) first notices an expedition into the North, at the end of which the king entered Kachchi, *i.e.,* Conjeeveram. As in the inscription of the 11^(th) year, it is then stated that he defeated the son of (Vira) Pandya, took Madurai and bestowed it on Vikrama-Pandya, and that he â€˜took the crowned headâ€™ of Vira-Pandya, who had revolted again and given him battle at Nettur.[\[14\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_iii.html#_ftn14) The next-following passage relates that he pardoned the Pandya king, *i.e.,* apparently Vira-Pandya, and the Chera king, who seems to be identical with the person who is subsequently called Vira-Kerala.[\[15\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_iii.html#_ftn15)
Finally, an unnamed Pandya king who bore the surname â€˜chief of the family of the Sunâ€™ received valuable presents. An inscription of the 21^(st) year adds that Kulottunga III. placed his feet on the crown of the king of Ilam, *i.e.,* Ceylon.[\[16\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/kulottunga_chola_iii.html#_ftn16)

In his *Annual Report* for 1898-99, Mr. Venkayya has shown that the invasion of the Pandya country during the reign of the Ceylong king Parakramabahu, which is related in chapters 76 77 of the *Mahavamsa*, fell into the reign of the Chola king Rajadhiraja II. During this war there were two claimants for the throne of Madhura. One of them, Vira-Pandya, the son of Parakrama-Pandya, was supported by the Singhalese, and the other, Kulasekhara, by the Cholas. The former is probably the same person as the Vira-Pandya who was defeated and humiliated by Kulottunga III., while, as Mr. Venkayya suggests, Vikrama-Pandya, the protÃ©gÃ© of Kulottunga III., may have been the successor of Kulasekhara, the claimant of the Pandya throne whose part had been taken by Rajadhiraja II.
