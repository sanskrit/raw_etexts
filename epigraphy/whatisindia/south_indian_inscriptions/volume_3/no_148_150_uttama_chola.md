This inscription, which is fragmentary, registers the gift of a gold *kolgai* set with gems, to the god at Tiruvisalur. The place is mentioned in the *Devaram*. It is not known exactly what *kolgai* means. *Kombir-kolgai* occurs in the Tanjore inscriptions as an ornament for the tusk of Ganapati. Perhaps *kolgai* is the cover or mask which is generally put over the *linga* in Siva temples.

Hail ! Prosperity ! Udaiya\[pirattiyar Sembi\]yan-Mahadeviyar who had (obtained) in (her) sacred womb king Parakesarivarman *alias* the glorious Madurantaka (the son of) the glorious Gandaraditya, deposited . . . . . . . . . . . . .

This inscription, which is built in at the beginning, registers a gift of land for offerings by the mother of king Uttama-Chola, to the temple of Siddhesvaramudaiya-Mahadeva at Tirunaraiyur which was a *brahmadeya* in Tirunaraiyur-nadu.

**No. 150.- ON THE NORTH WALL OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE IN THE ADIMULESVARA TEMPLE AT TIRUPPALATTURAI**[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_148_150_uttama_chola.html#_ftn3)

This is a record of the time of Parakesarivarman Uttama-Chola and registers a grant of land to Dayaparapperambalam built in the temple (?) at Tiruppatturai. The assembly of Uttamasili-chaturvedimangalam, *i.e.,* the present Uttamasili village in the Trichniopoly district, received the gift and made it tax-free. Dayaparapperambalam herein mentioned was probably the name of a hall where the village assembly used to meet.

Hail ! Prosperity ! In the . . . . . . . . . . . . year of (*the reign of*) king Parakesarivarman *alias* the glorious Uttama-Chola . . . . . . . . . . . . . . the glorious Uttamasili-chaturvedimangalam (*which was* *a*) *brahmadeya* . . . . . . . . . . . . . Vasudevan and . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . the land purchased by these . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Having received (*this*) one *ma* and a half *sey* of land which they had purchased (*and which was*) on the western side . . . . . . . .. . . . . the fifty *padagam* belonging to Sandiran Vishnubhattan and his group of *sadukkam-*owners, - as an *ambalappuram* (*i.e.,* gift for the maintenance of an *ambalam*) to the (*hall called*) Dayaparapperambalam which they had built . . . . . . . . . . . . in this village ; and having received on hand the 5 five *kasu* of *tattirai* (*derived*) from this half *kani* and (*one*) *mundirigai* of assessed land of the 8^(th) *taram* (*class*), - ordered the said (land) of one *ma* and a half *sey* to be tax-free, as long as the moon and the sun (*endure)* ; caused the deduction of taxes (*to be entered*) in the land register (nilamudal ?) and the tax register (pottagam) and had (*the transaction*) engraved on stone on the sacred central shrine (*sriviman*) of (*the temple at*) Tiruppatturai. Since this land is not liable to pay *sennirvetti* and all other taxes, if (*any*) tax is shown (*against it*), (*the said persons*) shall pay a fine of 50 *kalanju* of gold which the assembly would decide for being credited to the sacred feet (*of the king*). Even after paying the gold demanded in full (*maraiyili)*, still we (*the members*) of the big assembly shall guard this land against (*payment of*) taxes.
