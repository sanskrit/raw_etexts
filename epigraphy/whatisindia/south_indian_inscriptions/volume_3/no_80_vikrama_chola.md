No. 80 Inscriptions in the Arulala-Perumal temple at Conjeeveram

[*No. 79 Inscriptions of Tirumalavadi*](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_79_vikrama_chola.html)

**No. 80.- Inscription in the Arulala-Perumal Temple**

This inscription (No. 33 of 1893) is engraved on the west wall of the stone platform called â€˜the mountainâ€™ (malai) in the Arulala-Perumal temple at Little Conjeeveram. As in the inscription of Ravivarman,[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_80_vikrama_chola.html#_ftn1) the temple is here stated to be situated in Tiruvattiyur, which belonged to Eyil-nadu, a subdivision of Eyirkottam[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_80_vikrama_chola.html#_ftn2) (1. 2).

The inscription is dated in the 9^(th) year of the reign of Parakesarivarman, *alias* Vikrama-Choladeva. The short poetical introduction mentions nothing of historical importance besides the conquest of Kalinga and the name of Vikrama-Cholaâ€™s queen, Mukkokkilanadigal. These two points are, however, sufficient to enable us to identify the king with the Vikrama-Chola of the inscriptions opening with the words poomaalai midainthu, who claims to have burnt the country of Kalinga,[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_80_vikrama_chola.html#_ftn3) and one of whose queens was named Mukkokkilanadi.[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_80_vikrama_chola.html#_ftn4)

The inscription records that a private person made over to the temple 780 *kalam* of paddy, with the stipulation that the interest, which amounts here to 50 *per cent*., should be applied for the requirements of the worship on 13 days of every year, *viz.,* on the day of the *nakshatra* Jyeshtha. In this *nakshatra*, we are told, were born the two Vaishnava saints Pudattalvar and Poygaiyalvar,[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_80_vikrama_chola.html#_ftn5) â€œwho were pleased to compose hyns in praise of the god (Alvar) of Tiruvattiyurâ€? (1. 2). That portion of the *Nalayiraprabandham*, which is entitled *Iyarpa*, opens with two hymns of 100 stanzas each, the first of which is ascribed to Poygaiyalvar and the second to Pudattalvar. In the first (verse 77) reference is made to Vehka, and in the second (verse 95 f.) to Attiyur. The second name has to be referred to the temple, because Vehka is the Tamil name of the river Vegavati,[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_80_vikrama_chola.html#_ftn6) which flows past the temple of Arulala-Perumal. At any rate the mention of the two *Alvars* as recognized saints in the subjoined inscription proves that they must have lived a long time before the 12^(th) century on the Christian era. As stated before (p. 148), two other *Alvars,* Kulasekhara and Sathagopa, are presupposed by an inscription of Kulottunga I. at Srirangam. In the *Annual Report* for 1899-1900 (p. 10) Mr. Venkayya states that an inscription of Sola-Keraladeva, whom he placed in the 11^(th) century of the Christian era, quotes the hymn *Tirunedundanadagam*. This is the name of the last hymn of the *Periyatirumoli*, the portion of the *Nalayiraprabandham* which was composed by Tirumangaiyalvar. The upper limit of this *Alvar* is the beginning of the 8^(th) century A.D. ; for he celebrates in one of his hymns the temple of Paramesvara-Vinnagaram at Kachchi, *i.e.,* the Vaikuntha-Perumal temple at Conjeeveram, which seems to have been founded by the Pallava king Paramesvaravarman II.[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_80_vikrama_chola.html#_ftn7)

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! While the goddess with the lotus (*i.e.,* Lakshmi) wedded (*the king*), while the goddess of the Earth prospered, while the goddess of Speech was resplendent, while the goddess of Victory loved (*him*), (*and*) while (*all other*) kings bore (*on their heads*) his two lotus-feet, (*he*) put on the jeweled crown by established right. While (*his*) sceptre went and made all regions prosper, the cruel Kali (*age*) was driven away, and true righteousness flourished. (*He*) dispatched mountains of rut (*i.e.,* elephants) to subdue Kalinga. (*His*) discus wandered (*as far as*) the circular mountain surrounding (the earth) (*and his*) single parasol cast its shade up to the two luminaries (*i.e.,* the sun and the moon). Having performed the anointment of victory, (*he*) was pleased to take his seat on the throne of heroes together with (*his* *queen*) Mukkokkilanadigal.

(L. 2.) In the ninth year (*of the reign*) of this king Parakesarivarman, *alias* the emperor of the three worlds, Sri-Vikrama-Soladeva.

When on the day of Tirukkettai (*Jeshtha*), on which were born the saint Pudattalvar and the saint Poygaiyalvar, who were pleased to compose hymns in praise of the god (*Alvar*) of Tiruvattiyur in Eyil-nadu, (*a subdivision*) of Eyirkottam, (*a district*) of Jayangonda-Sola-mandalam, (*the god*) Arulala-Perumal is carried out, is bathed eighty-one times, and receives great offerings, - one *padakku* and two *nali* of paddy (*are required*) for thirty-six pots of sprouts[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_80_vikrama_chola.html#_ftn8) to be offered at the bath, *viz.,* one *uri* of paddy to be spread underneath each pot ; four *nali* of rice to purchase seeds for sprouting ; six *nali* and one *ulakku* of rice as fee (*for wishing*) an auspicious day (*punyaha*) ; two *nali* and one *uri* of rice for offerings *(balidravya*) ; one *nali* and one *ulakku* of oil for a perpetual lamp (*burning*) near the sprouts on five days, *viz.,* one *ulakku* of oil on each day ; three *ulakku* and one *alakku* of ghee for the *kritaharohanam* ; [\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_80_vikrama_chola.html#_ftn9)
five *kuruni* and one *uri* of paddy (*to be spread*) underneath eighty-one water-pots (*kalasa*) for the bath ; four *nali* of paddy for four large pots (*kumbha*) ; two *nali* of rice (to be spread) underneath one water-pot (*coated with*) chunnam ; thirteen pieces of cloth costing one *kanam* (of gold), to wrap round the water-pot ; half a *palam* of thread, to tie round the water-pot ; for the bath three *nali* of ghee, one *nali* of honey, three *nali* of milk*,* three *nali* of curds, the necessary ingredients for the bath, live metals and five gems ; forty *palam* of saffron (*nadan-manjal*), (*to be mixed*) with the chunnam ; one *uri* of lamp-oil ; one *uri* of ghee for burnt oblations (homa) ; three *kasu[\[10\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_80_vikrama_chola.html#_ftn10)* of sandal, six twentieths of camphor, half a *kalanju* of agallochum, one and two twentieths *manjadi* of musk, and two and four twentieths *manjadi* of civet-fat, to be rubbed on (*the image*) ; four *nali* of rice for *mattirai* (?) ; for the great offerings, three *kalam* and one *kuruni* of rice, one *padakku*, two *nali* and one *uri* of pulse, and eight hundred and twenty-five palam in weight of vegetables of various kinds ; for the vegetables, four *nali* of salt one *uri* pepper, one *alakku* and two and a half *sevidu* of mustard, one *alakku* of cumin, twenty *palam* of sugar, eleven *nali* and one *alakku* of ghee, fifty-five plantains, one *tuni* of curds, and three *kasu* of sugar-candy ; for *tirukkannamadai* (?), two *nali* of rice, one *ulakku* of ghee, twenty *palam* of sugar, and ten plantains ; for cakes, one *padakku* of rice, two *nali* and one *uri* of ghee, eighty *palam* of sugar, one *alakku* of pepper, two *sevidu* and a half of cumin, and three bundles of fire-wood ; for pots, one *kalam* of paddy ; one and a half *sevidu* of cardamoms, (to be mixed) with water ; four hundred and fifty areca-nuts and nine bundles of betel-leaves ; one *nali* and one *uri* of lamp-oil ; three *nali* of oil for twelve torches (?) of the lamp-lighters ; and two *nali* of oil for lamps (*held by*) images.

(L. 8.) Altogether, for each day of Tirukkettai, thirty *kalam* of paddy calculated by the average price (*and measured*) by the *marakkal* of Arumolinangai, with which the requirements of this temple are measured, were given in order to defray these (*requirements*). Consequently, for (*thirteen*) days in one year three hundred and ninety *kalam* of paddy are required.

(L. 9.) For (*this purpose*) seven hundred and eighty *kalam* of paddy were measured into the treasury of this god with the *marakkal* of Arumolinangai, with which the requirements are measured, by Mulaiyur-Udaiyan Vengadan[\[11\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_80_vikrama_chola.html#_ftn11) Adittadevan, *alias* Vangattaraiyan, of Vanga-Mulaiyur in Manni-nadu,[\[12\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_80_vikrama_chola.html#_ftn12) (*a subdivision*) of Virudarajabhayamkara-valanadu,[\[13\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_80_vikrama_chola.html#_ftn13) (*a district*) of Sola-mandalam. The interest on these seven hundred and eighty *kalam* of paddy â€“ at the rate of thirty-two *kalam*, one *tuni* and one *padakku* of paddy per month â€“ amounts to three hundred and ninety *kalam* of paddy per year â€“the rate of interest being one half *kalam* (per *kalam*).

(L. 10.)
