[*No. 87 to 88 Inscription at Chidambaram & Srirangam*](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_87_to_88_kulottunga_chola_iii.html)

**No 85.- Inscription at Tirumanikuli**

This inscription (No. 165 of 1902) is engraved on the right of the entrance into the east wall of the *prakara* of the Vamanapurisvara temple at Tirumanikuli in the Cuddalore taluka[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_85_to_86_kulottunga_chola_iii.html#_ftn1) of the South Arcot district. This village is called Udavi-Manikuli by Tirunanasambandar, and Udavi-Tirumanikuli in some of its inscriptions.
According to the subjoined record (1. 3 f.) it belonged to the district of Rajaraja-valanadu, and according to other inscriptions to Melkkal-nadu, Merkanadu or Merka-nadu, a subdivision of Vadakarai-Rajendra-Chola-valanadu, Virudarajabhayamkara-valanadu,[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_85_to_86_kulottunga_chola_iii.html#_ftn2) or Rajaraja-valanadu.

The inscription is dated in the 3^(rd) year of Kulottunga-Chola III. on a day which corresponds to the 12^(th) August A.D. 1180.[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_85_to_86_kulottunga_chola_iii.html#_ftn3)
It records the gift of 32 cows for a lamp. The donor was a native of Kudal, which was situated in the same district as Tirumanikuli and seems to be identical with the modern Kudalur (Cuddalore).[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_85_to_86_kulottunga_chola_iii.html#_ftn4)

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! (*The king*) put on the beautiful crown in order to protect the earth to the end of the world, while clouds were abundant (*and*) increased the fertility (*of his country*) ; while the conduct (*prescribed*) in the four true Vedas prospered ; while the goddess of the Fortune and the goddess of Victory were greatly delighted (*to be his wives*) ; while (*his*) parasol shone like the white moon ; while victorious kings bowed at (*his*) feet; while the goddess of the Earth rejoiced ; while the rules of Manu flourished and spread ; *(and*) while (*the kingâ€™s*) discus and sceptre went (*and*) ruled every region.

(L. 2.) In the third year of (*this*) king Parakesarivarman *alias* the emperor of the three worlds, Sri-Kulottunga-Soladeva, who was pleased to be seated together with (*his queen*) Bhuvanamulududaiyal on the throne of heores (*which consisted of*) pure gold, - on the day of Asvini, which corresponded to a Monday and to the fifth *tithi* of the second fortnight of the month Simha, - one perpetual lamp was given to Aludaiyanayanar of Tirumanikuli, the god of Rajaraja-valanadu, by Arasanarayanan Elisaimogan, *alias* Jananatha-Kachchiyarayan, of Kudal in the same *nadu*. For (*this lamp he*) granted 32 undying and unaging cows.[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_85_to_86_kulottunga_chola_iii.html#_ftn5)

(L. 4.) Having received these thirty-two cows, we, the members of the assembly (*in charge*) of the store-room[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_85_to_86_kulottunga_chola_iii.html#_ftn6) of this temple, shall have to maintain this perpetual lamp as long as the moon and the sun shall last.

This inscription (No. 457 of 1902) is engraved on the west wall of the second *prakara* of the great Saiva temple of Nataraja at Chidambaram[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_85_to_86_kulottunga_chola_iii.html#_ftn7) in the South Arcot district. It is dated on the 88^(th) day of the 9^(th) year of Kulottunga-Chola III. and records that the king sanctioned a grant of land to the temple by a certain Keralarajan (II. 6 and 10). The land granted was situated in two hamlets of Chidambaram, the first of which bore the name Kadavaychcheri *alias* Tillainayaganallur (1. 6). Kadavachcheri is found on the map about 2 miles south of Chidambaram,[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_85_to_86_kulottunga_chola_iii.html#_ftn8) and Tillainayaganallur survives as the name of a neighbouring village which has now been joined to Usuppur.[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_85_to_86_kulottunga_chola_iii.html#_ftn9) The second hamlet, Sattangudi *alias* Mahipalakulakalanallur[\[10\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_85_to_86_kulottunga_chola_iii.html#_ftn10)
