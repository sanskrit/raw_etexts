**No. 106.â€” ON THE ROCK AT THE ENTRANCE INTO THE CENTRAL SHRINE OF THE NARASINGAPPERUMAL TEMPLE AT ANAIMALAI**[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_106_108_parakesarivarman_parantaka_i.html#_ftn1)

This record which is written in the Vatteluttu character is the only inscription of Parantakaâ€™s reign hitherto found in the vicinity of Madura. It is dated in his 33 rd year and records a gift by Marudurudaiyan ArunidiKaliyan, an officer of Sola-Perumanadigal (*Parantaka I*.) to the temple of Narasingapperumanadigal of the sacred Anaimalai (*hill*). The temple had to pay 18 *ilakkasu* every year to the assembly and it had only arranged for the payment of six *ilakkasu*. Arunidi Kaliyan apparently agreed to pay the rest himself taking possession of the tank Kaliyaneri which must have belonged to the temple. He also provided for offerings to the god and the feeding of five Brahmanas, by purchasing two *veils* of we land under the tank Kaliyaneri. It was stipulated that the feeding of the Brahmanas was to commence from Friday in the month of Karkataka (*of this year*) when there was an eclipse of the sun and the nakshatra *was Aslesha. This incidental mention of the astronomical details helps us to confirm the initial dae of Parantaka I. (*viz., 907 A.D.) already arrived at by Professor Kielhorn from other inscriptions. According to Mr. L.D.
Swamikkannu Pillaiâ€™s *Ephemeris,* A.D. 939, July 19, was a Friday on which the *nakshatra* Aslesha ended at 80 after mean sunrise. There was also on this day an eclipse of the sun a 7 hours, 57 minutes after sunrise according to Dr. Robert Schramâ€™s â€œ*Eclipses of the Sun in India*.â€? It was a total eclipse of great importance. We learn again from the record that Â¼ *puttakkam* was the interest charged on 1 *ilakkasu* for one month and that each *ilakkasu* was equal to 7 Â½ *puttakkam*.[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_106_108_parakesarivarman_parantaka_i.html#_ftn2)

Hail ! Prosperity ! In this, the 33^(rd) year of (*the reign of*) king Parakesarivarman, who took Madirai (*Madura*), (*the following*) is the deed agreed upon and given by us, the members of the assembly of Narasingamangalam, a *brahmadeya* and a *devadana* included in Kil-Iraniyamuttam, to Marudurudaiyan Arunidi Kaliyan of Marudur in Purangarambai-nadu (*a subdivision*) of Sola-nadu who was na officer of Solapperumanadigal (*i.e.,* *Parantaka I*.). (*The temple of*) Narasinga-Perumanadigal of the sacred Anaimalai (*hill*) in our village has to pay to (*us*) the members of the assembly, eighteen *ilakkasu* annually on account of the lands belonging to it. One third of this eighteen *kasu* in six *ilakkasu*. For (*realizing*) this six *ilakkasu* fifteen *ilakkasu* had been deposited on interest in the hands of the members of the assembly. The interest accruing on the fifteen (*ilakkasu*) is as follows : â€” At (*the rate of*) one-fourth *puttakkam* per month on each *ilakkasu*, there accrues in each month (on the fifteen *ilakkasu*) three and three-fourths *puttakkam* for one *ilakkasu (these)* forty-five (*puttakkam*) would give six *ilakkasu*.
Deducting these six *ilakkasu* from the taxes (*due*), the god has (still) to pay 12 *kasu* to the members of the assembly. The officer Marudurudaiyan ArunidiKaliyan, having caused to be deducted these 12 *kasu* (*due to the* *assembly by the god*), (*by the virtue of*) Urudaiyankulam *alias* Kaliyaneri*.* This tank he shall dig (*to any depth*) he likes and throw up the embankment to its (*full*) length ; shall rise the tank bund and collect water in ;this tank to the extent required by him.[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_106_108_parakesarivarman_parantaka_i.html#_ftn3) Marudurudaiyan Arunidi Kaliyan (*also*) purchased below this tank two *veli* of wet land[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_106_108_parakesarivarman_parantaka_i.html#_ftn4).
And 300 *kalam* of paddy (*measured*) by the *annalikkal* was got as produce from (*these*) two *veli* of wet land under this tank. Receiving the moiety of this (*viz*.,) 150 (*kalam*) of paddy, (he arranged that) sacred food shall be offered to this (*god*) at the three junctures (of the day). With the remaining 150 (*kalam*) of paddy (*he also* *arranged that*) five Brahmanas (*versed in the*) Vedas shall beefed with superior food daily, when the god is fed, on the (*following*) scale laid down: â€” for one man two *nali* of rice pounded ten or eight times, three vegetables, (one) *nali* of curd, two *sevidu* of ghee, two areca-nuts and (*two*) betel leaves, five plates (*talam*), five cups (*vattil*) one *ottutti*, one ladle (*sattuvam*). Five *nali* of paddy daily (*and*) one cloth for (*every*) six months, were (*also*) provided for one cook. Thus this feeding should be done. Commencing from the day when an eclipse of the sun at its least[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_106_108_parakesarivarman_parantaka_i.html#_ftn5) occurred on the (*asterism*) Aslesha corresponding to a Friday in the month of Karkataka of this year, the supervisor of the temple business (*srikaryam*), viz., Tiruvayppadi â€“ Narayanan and the members of this village personally arranged thus to conduct this feeding. We, who look after the business of the (*temple*) of Narasinga-Peruman of the sacred Anaimalai (*hill*), and the members of the assembly shall conduct the sumptuous feeding in this wise without failure as long as the sun and the moon (*last*). Any of us that fails to do this, whether (*he be*) a member of the assembly or a supervisor of temple business, when he fails, (*shall*) pay a daily fine of two *kasu* to the then reigning king, and with that *kasu* (*collected as fine*) a sacred lamp shall be burnt in (*the temple*) of the god. If the members of the assembly (*as a whole body*) fail to do (*this*), (*they*) shall pay a fine of six *kasu.* (*Thus*) We, the members of the assembly and the supervisor of the temple business, gave an agreement ot Marudurudaiyan Arunidi Kaliyan. Even after paying this fine (*we*), the assembly and the Vaishnavas who supervise the temple business, shall feed the five persons as long as the moon and the sun last without stopping this charity. He who protects this charity.

**No. 107.â€” ON THE NORTH WALL OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE IN THE SIVAYOGANATHASVAMIN TEMPLE AT TIRUVISALUR**[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_106_108_parakesarivarman_parantaka_i.html#_ftn6)

This inscription records a gift of sheep for a lamp to the temple of Tiruvisalur by a female servant of Kamaniyakkanar. This lady who was apparently a member of the royal family is not mentioned elsewhere.

Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 3^(rd) year of (*the reign of*) Parakesarivarman, who took Madirai (*Madura*) Isakkanayya â€“ Nangai, one of the servants (*parivaram*) of Kamaniyakkanar of . . . . . . . . . .. nadu, gave one sacred lamp (*to burn*) as long as the moon and the sun (last), as a sacred perpetual light, to (*the temple of*) the god of Tiruvisalur in Amaninarayana-chaturvedimangalam which was a *devadana* and a *brahmadeya* on the north bank (*of the Kaveri*). For this (*purpose*) (*she*) gave ninety sheep. (*The assembly of*) all *Mahesvaras . . . . . . . . . . . . . .* shall protect this. The sacred feet \[of those who protect\] (*shall be*) on (*my head*).

**No. 108.â€” ON A SLAB BUILT INTO THE FLOOR OF THE ADHIPURISVARA TEMPLE AT TIRUVORRIYUR**[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_106_108_parakesarivarman_parantaka_i.html#_ftn7)

This inscription is dated in the 34^(th) year of king Parakesarivarman who took Madura and records the gift of 90 sheep for a lamp to the Siva temple at Tiruvorriyur (Adhipuri), by the chief Maran Paramesvaran *alias* Sembiyan Soliyavaraiyan of Sirukulattur, on his return from conquering Sitpuli and destroying Nellur. The mutilated Sanskrit verse at the beginning gives the king the title Virakirti. This military campaign reveals for the first time the extent to which the sway of the Chola king Parantaka I. extended on the east coast.[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_106_108_parakesarivarman_parantaka_i.html#_ftn8)

The name Sitpuli is Tamil and means â€˜the fierce tiger.â€™ The corresponding Sanskrit equivalent, if any, must end in the word *vyaghra.* We do not know of any names of contemporaneous kings of the Telugu country at this period which ended either with *vyaghra* or *puli*.
