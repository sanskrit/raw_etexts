**Miscellaneous Inscriptions From the****TamilCountry**

**Introduction**

From the death of Parantaka I., which must have occurred about the year A.D. 953, to the accession of thegrat Rajaraja I in A.D. 985, Chola history is obscure. During this period of 33 years there were five princes who must have occupied the throne. The irregular order of the succession suggests that there must have been internal feuds among the different members of the royal family. We have seen above that the eldest son of Parantaka I, prince Rajaditya, lost his life in the battle of Takkolam before the death of his father. Therefore, this prince could not have reigned over the Chola dominions, though it is stated in the Leyden plates that he became king after Parantaka I. It is significant that the Tiruvalangadu grant does not make him a ruler.

Parantaka I was perhaps succeeded by his second son Rajakesarivarman Gandaraditya. Some inscriptions of a â€œMadiraikonda Rajakesarivarmanâ€? have been ascribed to Gandaraditya[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/introduction2.html#_ftn1).
One of these which is dated in his 8^(th) year (No. 112) mentions Alvar Arikulakesarideva. The epithet Alvar is taken to be one of respect. It may also indicate that he was dead at the time. Another is dated in the 17^(th) year of this king. No event of any importance seems to have taken place in his reign. A part of the Chola dominions must have been under the Rashtrakutas. The Chola power was, for the time being, eclipsed. Hence the paucity of inscriptions during his reign. Some religious hymns extant in Tamil under the authorship of Gandaraditya are attributed to him. These show that he must have been a king with a religious bent of mind. Gandaradityaâ€™s queen was Udaiyapirattiyar *alias* Madevadigalar sembiyan Madeviyar who bore him a son called Madhurantaka Uttama-Chola. At the time of Gandaradityaâ€™s death, Uttama-Chola must have been a young boy, as he was set aside in the order of succession till three kings after Gandaraditya had ruled and died. His mother survived her husband for a long time. She seems to have been a pious lady, as she figures in several inscriptions, making donations to various temples.

If Arikulakesari, Arikesari, Arinjaya or Arindama, died before the 8^(th) year of Gandaraditya as inferred already, the next king must have been a son of Arikulakesari who, as the Anbil plates say, was prince Sundara-Chola born of a Vaidumba princess. He succeeded to the Chola throne under the name of Parantaka II., and bore the titles Rajakesarivarman[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/introduction2.html#_ftn2) and Rajendra. In his stone inscriptions Sundara-Chola assumes the epithet â€œ*Pandiyanaichuram-irakkina*â€?, i.e., who caused the Pandya king to enter the forest. The large Leyden grant records that he fought a sanguinary battle at Cheur, but it does not mention the name of the enemy. It also says that his son Aditya II., while yet a boy, played sportively with Vira-Pandya, as a lionâ€™s cub with an infuriated elephant. Therefore, it may be presumed that Aditya-Karikala was the chosen heir-apparent and that Sundara-Cholaâ€™s adversary mentioned above was the Pandya king Vira-Pandya. It is also worthy of note that after Parantaka I, Sundara-Chola was the next king that fought with the Pandyas. In an inscription of the reign of Rajaraja I, on eof the generals of Sundara-Chola named Parantakan Siriyavelar *alias* Tirukkarrali Pichchan of Kodumbalur is said to have died in a battle-field in Ceylon in the 9^(th) year of *Ponmaligai-tunjina-devar[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/introduction2.html#_ftn3)*, i.e., Parantaka II., the father of Rajaraja I. This campaign in which the general of Sundara-Chola lost his life must have occurred during the reign of the Singhalese king Mahinda IV., in whose reign, as stated in the *Mahavamsa* (Chapter LIV), there was a fight with Vallabha[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/introduction2.html#_ftn4), (i.e., the Chola king), in which it is stated, that Mahindaâ€™s general defeated the Chola army. The date ascribed by Wijesinha to Mahinda IV does not fit in with the time of Parantaka II., but if we deduct the error of 23 years which, according to Dr. Hultzsch has crept into this part of the chronology of the *Mahavamsa,* Mahindaâ€™s reign would fall into the same period as that of Sundara-Chola.[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/introduction2.html#_ftn5)
It is interesting to note that thegeneral Siriyavelar or Siruvela was a member of the royal family being the son of the daughter of king Parantaka I who was perhaps identical with the Chola princess Anupama, the queen of Smarabhirama of the Irungola race (No. 121). The Anbil plates[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/introduction2.html#_ftn6) which are dated in the 4^(th) year of this kingâ€™s reign, mention a Brahman minister of his named Aniruddha-Brahmadhiraja.

As stated already, Sundara-Chola is referred to in later Chola inscriptions as *pon-maligaitunjina devar*, i.e., the king who died in the golden palace. He was a very powerful ruler, much loved by his subjects. The Tiruvalangadugrants says that his subjects believed him to be Manu come to the earth to establish his laws which had become lax under the influence of the Kali age. His queen was Vanavanmahadevi[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/introduction2.html#_ftn7) who committed *sati* at the death of her husband. Her daughter Kundavai, who had married a Pallava chief named Vandyadevar set up an image of her in the temple at Tanjore.

If Gandaraditya ruled for at least 17 years â€“ that being the latest regnal year obtained from inscriptions from him â€“ and Parantaka I died in 947 A.D., not taking into account the date of a doubtful inscription which gives the 46^(th) year of his reign, the accession of Sundara-Chola Parantaka II will fall in or about 964 A.D. which coincides with the accession of Udaya III of Ceylon, as given in Wijesinhaâ€™s translation of the *Mahavamsa*. Sundara-Cholaâ€™s latest year of reign as given in his inscriptions is the 5^(th). But from a later inscription of the time of Rajaraja I we learn that in the 9^(th) year of Sundara-Chola Parantaka II a deadly battle was fought in Ceylon, perhaps with Udaya III, in which a general of Sundara-Chola, by name Siriyavelan died. Perhaps, Sundara-Chola died soon after and we may for the sake of a tentative chronology give him a reign of 10 years. This brings us to A.D. 974.

Between him and Uttama-Chola, the son of Gandaraditya, must be accommodated Parakesarivarman Aditya II Karikala, a son of Sundara-Chola and elder brother of Rajaraja I, and Parthivendravarman, Parthivendradivarman, Parthivendradhipativarman, Parthivendra Adityavarman, Parakesari Vendiradivarman or the Paramamaharaja Rajamarayar. Both these kings claim the epithet, â€˜who took the head of Pandya or Vira-Pandya â€“ evidently the same Pandya king who was at war with Sundara-Chola Parantaka II â€“ and the title Parakesarivarman.
Inscriptions of the former are very few and found only in the south, the latest regnal year being the 5^(th). Of the latter, there are many in Tondai-mandalam and the latest regnal year is the 13^(th). Parthivendra Adityavarman may have been a prince of the royal family and Viceroy of Tondai-mandalam. Aditya Karikala appears to have been the actual successor. He reigned for 6 years and was succeeded in 969 A.D. by Parakesarivarman Uttama-Chola, the son of Gandaraditya. The circumstances under which the crown instead of going to Arunmolivarman Rajaraja I, the younger brother of Aditya II Karikala, went to uttama-Chola Madhurantaka are explained in the Tiruvalangadu plates.
