**No. 82.- Inscription at Kilur**

This inscription (No. 273 of 1902) is engraved on the north wall of the *mandapa* in front of the shrine in the Virattanesvara temple at Kilur[\[11\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_81_to_82_virarajendra_i.html#_ftn11) near Tirukoilur (Tirukkovalur). As in other inscriptions, the temple is here called Tiruvirattanam and is stated to be situated at Tirukkovalur in Kurukkai-kurram, a subdivision of Jananatha-valanadu.[\[12\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_81_to_82_virarajendra_i.html#_ftn12)

The inscription is dated in the 5^(th) year of Virarajendra I. and records the gift of a lamp by a native of Kuriyur in Sengunra-nadu, a subdivision of Rajendra-Chola-valanadu. Kuriyur is stated to have been a hamlet in the west of Virarajendra-chaturvedimangalam. According to No. 81 above, this was a surname of Perumbakkam, which belonged to another subdivision of Rajendra-Chola-valanadu ; but the map does not show any village named Kuriyur on the west of Perumbakkam.

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! While courage was (his) only help and liberality (his) only ornament, (the king) wielded the sceptre and dispelled the dark Kali (age). (He) terrified Ahavamalla at Kudalsangama, saw the retreating back of Vikkalan and Singanan, and seized riches and vehicles along with his (*viz.,* Ahavamallaâ€™s) great queens.

(L. 3.) (He) terrified Ahavamalla yet a second time on the appointed battle-field, fulfilled the vow of the elder brother who was born with him,[\[13\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_81_to_82_virarajendra_i.html#_ftn13) seized Vengai-nadu, and performed the anontment of victors.

(L. 4.) In the 5^(th) year of (this) king Rajakesarivarman *alias* the lord Sri-Virarajendradeva, who was pleased to be seated on the throne of heroes together with (his queen) Ulagamulududaiyal, - I, the *Manradi* Ulagan Modan, residing at Kuriyur in Sengunra-nadu, a hamlet in the west of Virarajendra-chaturvedimangalam, an independent village[\[14\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_81_to_82_virarajendra_i.html#_ftn14) Virarajendra-Sola-valanadu, gave 1 perpetual lamp for the merit of[\[15\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_81_to_82_virarajendra_i.html#_ftn15) my son odan Surri to (the god) Mahadeva of the Tiruvirattanam (temple) at Tirukkovalur in Kurukkai-kurram, (a subdivision) of Jananatha-valanadu. For (this lamp I) gave 48 big sheep. These big sheep (shall) neither die nor grow old.[\[16\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_81_to_82_virarajendra_i.html#_ftn16)
Having received these (sheep), . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \[This gift is placed under\] the protection of \[all *Mahe\]svaras*.

Among the fragments of the concluding portion of this inscription occurs the statement that a village, which may be identical with Perumbakkam, received the new name Vira-Solanallur. This name is evidently derived from Vira-Chola, one of the title target="\_self"s of Virarajendra I.
