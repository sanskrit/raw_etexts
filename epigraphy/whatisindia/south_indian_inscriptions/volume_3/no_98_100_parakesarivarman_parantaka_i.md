This inscription is dated in the 10^(th) year of Parakesarivarman. It registers gift of sheep for lamps, made by Sembiyan Marayan, a *perundanam* of Virasola Ilangovelar of Kodumbalur, to the temple of Karkudi in Nandivanmamangalam. Karkudi as the ancient name of Uyyakkondan Tirumalai occurs in the hymns of the *Devaram*.
Parakesarivarman of this inscription has been identified with Parantaka I. in the *Epigraphical Report* for 1908-09, page 88.

In the 10h year of (*the reign of*) king Parkesarivarman, Peranan Viranarayanan, *alias* Sembiyan Marayan, a *perundanam* of Virasola Ilangovelar of Kodumbalur in Urattur-kurram, gave ninety full-grown ewes which neither die nor grow old for a sacred perpetual lamp to be burnt regularly, as long as the moon and the sun (*endure*), with (*one*) *ulakku* of ghee supplied by (*the measure called*) *sula-vulakku*, to the great god (*Paramesvara*) at thesacred Karkudi in Nandipanmamangalam which was a *brahmadeya* on the southern bank (*of the Kaveri*). Having received (*these*) ninety (*ewes*), we, the temple servants (*devarkanmi*), agreed to burn (*the lamp*). In this same year, the self-same person gave fifty full-grown ewes which neither die nor grow old, for burning a day-lamp (*in the same temple*). Having received these fifty ewes also, we, the temple servants, consented to burn regularly (*the lamp*), supplying (*one*) *alakku* of ghee by (*the measure called*) *sula-vulakku*. This (*charity*) shall be (*under)* the protection of (*the assembly of*) all *Mahesvaras.*

**No. 99.â€” ON THENORTH WALL OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE IN THE KHARAPURISVARA TEMPLE AT TIRUPPARKKADAL.**[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_98_100_parakesarivarman_parantaka_i.html#_ftn2)

This interesting record registers a gift of gold made by a military officer for strengthening the bund of a tank, by depositing on it the silt-removed from that tank. The gift, however, appears to have been utilized subsequently for feeding our Brahmanas in the local temple, for the merit of the four heroes who fell in a battle on the occasion when the donor Tiran Sennipperaraiyan of Araisur made a frontal attack with his colleagues on the enemy, in a fierce battle (*astikkadai*) fought at Velur between Perumanadigal (i.e., Parantaka I.) and the allied Pandya and Ceylon kings. Theresult of the battle is not stated ; but from the Udayendiram plates published above, in Volume II, pages 375 ff., Parantaka I. is known to have conquered Madura after defeating its ruler the Pandya king rajasimha and to have repulsed an army of the king of Lanka (Ceylon), thereby earning for himself the surname Sangramaraghava. The Ceylon king who at this time must have sent his army in support of the Pandya could have been no other than Kassappa V. who, according to the traditional account given in the *Mahawamsa,* would have reigned from A.D. 906 to 916 *(Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society for July 1913*, page 525 f.) The commencement of the reign of Parantaka I has been fixed by Professor Kielhorn to lie between 15^(th) January and 25^(th) July A.D. 907.

This inscription is dated in the 14^(th) year of Parakesarivarman, â€˜the conqueror of Madura,â€™ and records a gift of land for a lamp to the Siva temple at Karugavur near Tirukkudamukkil by a certain merchant of Nandipuram. The village Nandipuram is mentioned in the *Nalayiraprabandham* as the seat of a Vishnu temple and is identical with Natl-ankovil near Kumbakonam. Utpalaru, on which the village Karugavur is stated to have been situated, must be one of the several branches of the river Kaveri.
