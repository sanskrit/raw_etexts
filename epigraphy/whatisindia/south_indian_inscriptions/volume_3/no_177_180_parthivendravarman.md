In the 5^(th) year of Parthivendradhipativarman who took the head of Vira Pandya, the members of the assembly of Uttarameri-chaturvedimangalam gave certain lands in their village as *Vishaharabhoga* for the maintenance of a physician who removed (snake ?) poison. Inasmuch as the at the end of line 5 it is stipulated that he who has obtained the order of the members of the assembly shall alone enjoy the land, it is probable that the lands in question were assigned only to experts in that profession.

In the 5^(th) year of (*the reign of*) Parthivendradhipativarman who took the head of Vira-Pandya, (*this is*) the writing of us (*the members*) of the big assembly of Uttarameru-chaturvedimangalam.

The record states that in the 5^(th) year of king Parthivendravarman a certain Nilakandaraiyan Annavan Nattadigal gave, on the occasion of a solar eclipse, 1 Â½ *patti* of land to the god Mahadeva of Tanakkamalai for conducting *sribali*, on behalf of Nilagangaraiyan Annavan Nattadigal who was perhaps his brother. *Sribali* is a ceremony performed by sounding drums and throwing cooked rice and flowers all round the temple. This inscription provides for five men to sound the different musical instruments used on the occasion.

Hail! Prosperity ! In the 5^(th) year of king Parthivendravarman, at the request of the residents of Miyvali-Tayanur in Singapura-nadu, I, the glorious Nilakandaraiyan Annavan Nattadigal[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_177_180_parthivendravarman.html#_ftn5) gave, for (*the merit of*) the glorious Nilagangaraiyan Annavan Nattadigal on the occasion of a solar eclipse and to last as long as the moon and sun, to the god Mahadeva (*Siva*) of Tanakkamalai one *patti* of land in (*the field called*) Tenkarpatti of this village and half (*patti*) of land including the western division, in Tarippatti, as a *sribali-bhoga* (in order that the *sribali)* may be sounded by five men. Tiran Mudaiyan, the chief of Merkudi in Umbala-nadu and his younger brother Tiran Ulagadigal paid gold to the residents (*of the village*), took complete possession by purchase of this 1 Â½ *patti* of land and had it make tax-free. We two, Tiran Mudaiyan, and Tiran Ulagadigal carried out the *sribali-bhoga* in the manner (*described*).
This (*charity*) shall be under the protector of all *Mahesvaras.*

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 5^(th) year of (*the reign of*) Parthivendradivarman who took the head of the Pandya (*king*), we the members of the assembly of Uttarameru-chaturvedimangalam, (*a village*) in its (*own*) subdivision (*kuru*) in Kaliyur-kottam wrote (*thus*).
