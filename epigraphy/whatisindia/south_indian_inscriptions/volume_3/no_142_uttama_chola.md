**No. 142.- ON THE NORTH WALL OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE IN THE MANIKANTHESVARA TEMPLE AT TIRUMALPURAM**[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_142_uttama_chola.html#_ftn1)

This inscription is dated in the 14^(th) year and the 216^(th) day[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_142_uttama_chola.html#_ftn2) of Ko-non-inmaikondan[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_142_uttama_chola.html#_ftn3) while he was staying in his golden palace (pon-maligai) at Kachchippedu. In his introduction to *South-Indian Inscriptions*, Volume II, Part V, the late Mr. Venkayya surmised that *pon-maligai[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_142_uttama_chola.html#_ftn4)* in the word *pon-maligai-tunjinadeva* must dnote the dancing hall of the god Nataraja at Chidambaram which is said to have been covered with gold both by Parantaka I. and by an early Pallava sovereign[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_142_uttama_chola.html#_ftn5).
The reference in this inscription to the golden palace at Kachchippedu seems, however, to indicate that the term *pon-maligai* should refer to the palace and not to the golden hall of the Chidambaram temple. It is more appropriate that the death of Sundara-Chola called Ponmaligai-tunjinadeva should have happened in a palace instead of a temple.

The record is of much historical interest. It refers first to a grant of revenue in paddy and in gold, made in the 21^(st) and 22^(nd) years of a Chola king entitled Tonddaimanarrur-tunjinadeva, to the temple at Tirumalperu. The grant, was not entered in the revenue registers, evidently by a mistake, and was therefore rectified in the 4^(th) year of Parakesarivarman, â€˜who took Madirai and Ilam.â€™ A fresh grant was also made to the temple in the 36^(th) year of this same king. This latter grant being misappropriated by the assembly of Puduppakkam which was entrusted with the management of the gift, a complaint was lodged before the king, here referred to as Ko-non-inmai-kondan, in the 14^(th) year of his reign. The offending members were fined for the mistake committed and orders were issued that the defaulting members of the assembly should in future conduct the trust honestly.

Rai Bahadur V. Venkayya has fully discussed the contents of this inscription and their historical bearing in the *Madras Epigraphical Report* for 1907, p.71 f. He points out that Tondaimanarrur-tunjinadeva, who preceded Parakesarivarman the conqueror of Madirai and Ilam, could be no other than the laterâ€™s father Aditya I., and that the title which means â€˜who died at Tondaimanarrurâ€™ must indicate that Aditya I, who was the actual conqueror of Tondai and the hero who deprived the Ganga Pallavas of the last vestiges of their authority, died in the Tondai country in the village Tondaimanarrur (*i.e.,* the modern Tondamanad near Kalahasti). It is not clear who king Ko-non-inmai-kondan was in whose 14^(th) year the present record was written. In identifying him it has to be observed that he rectified a mistake which was committed in the 36^(th) year of Parantaka I. and which was brought to his notice in his 14^(th) year. Mr. Venkayya was inclined to identify Ko-non-inmai-kondan with AdityaKarikala (II) whose latest date known from inscriptions, however, is his 5^(th) year.
Ko-non-inmai-kondan may have been Rajakesarivarman Gandaraditya, the immediate successor of Parantaka I. But the appearance of the same names among the signatories in this record as well as in another document distinctly of the time of Uttama-Chola, makes it almost certain that the Ko-non-inmai-kondan of the Tirumalpuram inscription is not other than king Uttama-Chola.

The publicity given to the order by communicating it to the headmen of all *Brahmadeya* villages, the residents of the *Devadana, Pallichchanda, Kanimurruttu* and *Vettapperru* villages in Manaiyil-nadu, the long list of officers that held various public offices such as *Anatti,* *Vaykkelvi, Olai-nayagam, Puravuvari, Varippottagam*, Kanakku, Variyilidu, Pattolai and Mugavetti who executed the order and witnessed the transaction, and the perspicuity with which thefacts themselves are detailed in the record, are worthy of note.

Of the villages mentioned Sirriyarrur and Puduppakkam may be identified with Sittattur and Puduppakkam in the Walajapet taluk of the North Arcot district. The terms *puravu* and *iravu* applied to the income in paddy have not been clearly understood.

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! (*This is the order of*) Ko-non-inmai-kondan[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_142_uttama_chola.html#_ftn6) to the residents (*nattar*) of Manaiyil-nadu in Manaiyil-kottam, to the headmen (*kilavar*) of Brahmadeya (*villages*), to the residents of the *Devadana, Pallichchanda, Kanimurruttu* and *Vettapperru* villages and to the residents of towns :-

(L. 8.) On the 216^(th) day of the 14^(th) year (*of our reign*) we being on the first floor of the golden hall (*pon-maligai*) within our mansion at Kachchippedu, the officer Sola-Muvendavelan informed us thus : -

(L. 12.) â€œSirriyarrur in Manaiyil-nadu (*a subdivision*) of Manaiyilkottam with (*its income of*) thre thousand *kadi* of *puravu* five hundred and sixty-one *kadi* of *iravu* and twenty-six and a half *kalanju* and *(one*) *manjadi* of gold, excluding the *kani* of Sangappadikilan, was assigned as a tax-free *devadana* to (*the temple of*) Mahadeva (*Siva*) at Tirumalperu in the twenty-first year of (*the reign* *of*) the king (*udaiyar*) who died a t Tondaimanarrur, and was made over to (the members) of the assembly of Puduppakkam which was a *brahmadeya* in Purisai-nadu of this *kottam*, as a *devadana* and *brahmadeya (with the stipulation)* that they should pay the said *puravu, iravu* and gold to the god.

(L. 23.) â€œ(*This village*) which was handed over in the 22^(nd) (*year of the same reign*) after its hamlets had been circumambulated and the (*necessary*) documents executed, was not, (*however*), entered in the accounts (*vari*). It was registered (*subsequently*) in the accounts (*vari)* as a *devadana* and a *brahmadeya* in the fourth year (*of the reign of*) king Parakesarivarman, â€˜who took Madirai (*Madura*) and Ilam (Ceylon)â€™, and (*accordingly*) the members of the assembly of Puduppakkam were themselves paying to the god, the (*said*) *puravu iravu* and gold.â€?

(L. 28.) â€œIn the 36^(th) year of (*the reign of*) king Parakesarivarman, â€˜who took Madiri (*Madurai*) and Ilam (Ceylon)â€™ the three thousand *kadi* of *puravu* accruing as produce from the estate *(kani)* of Sangappadikilan in this *(village of)* Sirriyarrur, was (*also*) entered in the accounts as a tax-free *devadana* (*in favour of*) the same (*temple of*) Mahadeva at Tirumalperu.â€?

(L. 32.) â€œ(*Now*), the managers of the temple (*devakanmigal*), the men in charge of (*its*) central shrine (*unnaligaiy-udaiyar*) and all the *Mahesvaras* come and complain that the members of the assembly of Puduppakkam have been misappropriating and enjoying this *kani* of Sangappadikilan bestowed (*on the temple*) in the above said manner, without paying the taxes to the god.â€?
