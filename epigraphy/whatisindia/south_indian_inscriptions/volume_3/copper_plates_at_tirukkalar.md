**No. 206.â€”TWO PANDYA COPPER PLATE GRANTS FROM SINNAMANUR**

These are two of the four sets of Pandya copper plate grants discovered so far and are herein published for the first time. The Velvikudi grant of Parantaka Nedunjadaiyan has been edited by me in the *Epigraphia Indica*, Vol. XVII, pp. 291 to 309 and the Madras Museum Plates of Jatilavarman, by the late Rai Bahadur V. Venkayya in the *Indian Antiquary*, Vol. XXII, pp. 57 to 75. These four, studied together, furnish a genealogy of the Pandyas from the early king Kadungon, who is said to have flourished at the close of the first Sangam of Tamil poets, down to Rajasimha-Pandya[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/copper_plates_at_tirukkalar.html#_ftn1), the contemporary of the Chola king Parantaka I, who reigned at the commencement of the 10^(th) century A.D. With the invasion of the latter into the Pandya country and his capture of Madura, which earned for him the title â€˜Madiraikondaâ€™, the early Pandya power seems to have come to an end, and made room, for the next two centuries at least, for the unchallenged sway of the Cholas over the whole of Southern India.

The two grants under consideration have been thoroughly reported in the *Annual Report on Epigraphy* for 1906 - 1907, pp.62 ff. Speaking of their provenance, Mr. Venkayya states â€œthe plates are reported to have been found about 20 or 25 years ago (*now nearly forty years*) while digging for the foundation of the kitchen in the Vishnu temple at Sinnamanur[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/copper_plates_at_tirukkalar.html#_ftn2) in the Periyakulam taluka of the Madura district, and have since been purchased for deposit in the Madras Museum, from their owner Mr. Rajam Ayyar.â€?

The bigger of the two sets consists of seven copper plates, measuring approximately 10â€? by 3 3/8â€?. The thin rims which they once seem to have had, are now completely worn out. The plates are numbered on their obverse sides, with the Tamil numerals 2 to 8 close to the right side of the ring hole, thus showing that the first plate, whose obverse must have borne the number 1, is now lost. The last plate ending with the word *Karkulattil*, also shows that one or more plates which contained the last portion of the grant are lost. The ring which held the plates together and which, judging by the size of the ring holes in the middle of the left margin of each plate, must have been a little less than 3/8â€? in thickness, is missing. The existing seven plates weigh 390 *tolas*.

The smaller set consists of three thin plates without rims, *viz.,* the first, second and the last, with one or more plates of two written sides, missing between the second and the last. The first and the last plates are not numbered as in the larger set. The ring with which the plates were held together is lost. The ring-hole is not, as usual, bored in the middle of the left margin, but at the left bottom or the left top corner, according as the written side of the plate is odd or even â€” the sheets being meant evidently to be read by turning over the leaf, as in a palm-leaf manuscript without the necessity of actually removing the plate from the ring. The plates measure 8 1/1 Â½ â€œ by 3â€? and the three plates, together, weigh 51 *tolas*.

Both sets of plates use the Grantha alphabet wherever Sanskrit verses and Sanskrit words occur and the Tamil Vatteluttu where the Tamil language is employed. The paleography of the smaller set of plates does not differ much from that of the Madras Museum plates of Parantaka Nedunjadaiyan, who, as I have stated already in my paper on the Velvikudi grant, has to be identified with the donor of the latter and therefore also with Maranjanjadiyan of the Anaimalai inscription.[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/copper_plates_at_tirukkalar.html#_ftn3)

The remark made by Mr. Venkayya that the Madras Museum plates and the smaller Sinnamanur plates are nearer in point of time to the larger Sinnamanur plates than they are to the Velvikudi grant, has been already examined by me in the light of the palaeography of the plates under publication. I have noticed that the difference in the formation of the Grantha characters of the Velvikudi, the Madras Museum and the smaller Sinnamanur plates all of which in my opinion belong to the same period, should be due to their having been written at different periods later than their Vatteluttu portions. In the matter of their Vatteluttu writing, the smaller and the bigger Sinnamanur plates are far separated by time and the palaeographical differences are apparent. The formation of the initial vowel *a,* the *e*-mark in consonants, the letters *na, ma* and *ya* â€” of which the two latter, it is surprising to find, resemble the *ma* and *ya* â€” of which the two latter, it is surprising to find, resemble the *ma* and *ya* of the Velvikudi and the Anaimalai inscriptions, â€”show marked differences. The differences which the smaller Sinnamanur plates and the Madras Museum plates present, except in the formation of the letter *ya*, are very slight. They are almost nil. Consequently, Mr. Venkayyâ€™s identification of the second king Arikesari Asamasaman Maravarman mentioned in the smaller Sinnamanur plates with Maravarman Pallavabhanjana of the Madras Museum plates and that of his son â€” his unnamed son who was victorious at Marudur â€”
Jatilavarman Nedunjadaiyan of the same plates, becomes untenable even on the grounds of palaeography. This point will become clearer in the sequel where the identification of the kings mentioned in the smaller and the bigger Sinnamanur plates is discussed.

The Sanskrit portion of the bigger Sinnamanur plates begins with a fragmentary verse in which the king (perhaps Pandya) boasts of having subdued the ocean â€” an attribute which the mythical Pandya kings generally assumed in consequence, perhaps, of their sea-bordering kingdom, their naval power, and their sea-borne trade, from the earliest historical times. From him were descended the kings known as Pandyas (v. 2) â€˜who engraved their edicts on the Himalaya mountainâ€™ and whose family-priest was the sage Agastya (v. 3). One of the Pandya kings is said to have occupied the throne of Indra (v. 4) and another to have shared it with that god, and still another, to have caused the Ten-Headed (*i.e.,* Ravana of Lanka) to sue for peace (v. 5). One was a conqueror of the epic hero Arjuna (v. 7)[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/copper_plates_at_tirukkalar.html#_ftn4).
Verse 8 refers to a king who cut off his own head in order to protect that of his master and also to a certain Sundara-Pandya who had mastered all the sciences. Many kings of this family had performed Vedic sacrifices *Rajasuya* and *Asvamedha* (v. 9).[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/copper_plates_at_tirukkalar.html#_ftn5)

In this family was born king Arikesarin. His son was Jatila ; his son Rajasimha (II) ; his son Varaguna (I) ; and his son Sri-Mara entitled Srivallabha
