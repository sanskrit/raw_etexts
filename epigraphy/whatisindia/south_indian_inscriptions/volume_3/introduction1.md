\(37\) The Ancient History of Conjeeveram in the *Sketches of Ancient Dekkan* by K. V. S. Aiyar.

In publishing his paper on the *yupa* inscriptions of king Mulavarman from Koetei (East Borneo), Dr. J. Ph. Vogel throws out a suggestion that there might have existed a direct intercourse between the ancient Pallava capital Kanchi and the Archipelago. It is a well known fact that Siam, Annam, Cambodia, Java and Borneo abound in antiquities of Indian origin (See Book VIII in Fergussonâ€™s History of Indian and Eastern Architecture).

The revived line of the Cholas begins with Vijayalaya who is distinguished by the title Parakesarivarman. There are copper and lithic records which though not referring directly to his rule, mention him as a Chola king who had well established himself on the Chola throne. The Uttama-Chola plates already referred to in connection with Karkala mention the 22^(nd) year of a Parakesarivarman different from the later Parakesarivarman Parantaka I, â€˜who took Madirai and Ilamâ€™ (also referred to in the same inscription). Evidently the earlier Parakesari is Vijayalaya to whom also under the same title are attributed two stone records from the Kailasantha temple at Conjeeveram[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/introduction1.html#_ftn1) and another from Ukkal.

The Tiruvalangadu plates state that Vijayalaya captured the city of Tanjavur and made it his capital and that he also built in it a temple to the goddess Nisumbhasudani (Durga). The Kanyakumari inscription states that he constructed the city of Tanjapuri anew. Nos. 672 to 675 and 1071 of Prof. Kielhornâ€™s â€œ*Lists of Inscriptions of Southern India*â€? are attributed to Vijayalaya. These come from Conjeeveram, Ukkal, Tirukkovalur and Suchindram. The first three are places in Tondai-mandalam and the fourth is in the Pandya kingdom outside the limits of the Chola country.

If the resuscitation of the new Chola line of Tanjore was due to the conquests of Vijayalaya and its expansion in the north and south to those of his son Aditya I and his grandson Parakesarivarman Parantaka I, respectively, it is highly improbable that the records mentioned above could beattributed to the founder Vijayalaya. Probably they are to be assigned to Parakesarivarman Parantaka I.

It is not stated in any of the records, who the enemy was from whom Tanjore was wrested by Vijayalaya. About the middle of the 8^(th) century A.D. Tanjore and the surrounding country was under the rule of Muttaraiyan chiefs. In the Sendalai Pillar inscription of Perumbidugu Muttaraiya, the latter is styled â€œthe king Maran, the Lord of Tanjai (*Ko-Maran-ranjai-kkon*) and *Kalvar-Kalvan[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/introduction1.html#_ftn2)*, *Tanjai-nar-pugal-alan*, a Kalva of Kalvas, the
