**XIII.- Inscriptions of Rajakesarivarman Sundara-Chola Parantaka II**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

No. 119 to 122 Sivayoganathasavamin, Vedapurisvara temples

**No. 119.â€” ON THE NORTH WALL OF THE CENTRAL SHRINE IN THE SIVAYOGANATHASVAMIN TEMPLE AT TIRUVISALUR**[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/parantaka_ii.html#_ftn1)

This inscription is dated in the 2^(nd) year of Rajakesarivarman and registers a gift of land to the temple at Tiruvisalur by Pirantakan Irungolan *alias* Siriyavelar of Kodumbalur. This chief has been identified by Mr. K.V. Subrahmanya Aiyar with Pirantakan Siriyavelar *alias* Tirukkarrali-Pichchan mentioned in a Tirukkalittattai inscription.[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/parantaka_ii.html#_ftn2)
The name Siriyavelar occurs again in a much mutilated Tirukkalittattai inscription of the reign of Sundara-Chola *alias* Ponmaligaittunjinadevar (*i.e.,* the lord who died in the golden palace) who â€˜drove the Pandya into the forest[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/parantaka_ii.html#_ftn3).â€™
The king who died in the golden palace was Sundara-Chola Parantaka II., the father of Rajaraja I[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/parantaka_ii.html#_ftn4).
This Sundara-Chola Parantaka II., is called a Rajakesarivarman in No. 302 of 1908 quoted above which also refers to Ilam; but the passage is much mutilated. The officer Siriyavelar is stated in a record of the time of Rajaraja I.[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/parantaka_ii.html#_ftn5) to have died on the battlefield in Ceylon in the 9^(th) year of Ponmaligaittunjinadeva (i.e., Sundara-Chola Parantaka II.)[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/parantaka_ii.html#_ftn6).
Evidently Sundara-Chola Parantaka II. and his General were engaged in a battle with the Ceylon king who must as usual have helped with his forces the Pandya king, the natural enemy of the Cholas.

Applying the correction of 23 years in the *Singhalese Chronology* worked out by Professor Hultzsch (*Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society* for 1913, pp. 517-531) we gather that Mahinda IV. Must have been the sovereign of Ceylon who was contemporaneous with Sundara-Chola Parantaka II. In his time, according to the *Mahavamsa*, Chapter LIV, there was a fight with Vallabha (*i.e.,* the Chola king) in which it is stated that Mahindaâ€™s General â€˜destroyed him (the Chola) utterly.

Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 2^(nd) year of (*the reign of)* king Rajakesarivarman, Pirantakan Irungolan *alias* Siriyavelar of Kodumbalur purchased and give the following land for feeding at noon with one sumptuous meal[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/parantaka_ii.html#_ftn7) one Brahmana (*versed*) in the Vedas, in the sacred temple (*srikoyil*) of the god (*perumandigal*) of Tiruvisalur in Avaninarayana-chaturvedimangalam, a *devadana* and a *brahmadeya* on the northern bank (*of the Kaveri*), as long as the moon and the sun (*endure*). He (*also*) paid fifty *kalanju* of gold to the great men (*perumakkal*) of Tevangudi as *iraikaval[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/parantaka_ii.html#_ftn8)* for the one-eighth *sey (of land*) purchased from Tayanarayana Bhatta-Somayajiyar of Tolur, on the northern bank of the (*channel called*) Paramesvaravaykkal, (*forming*) the first padagam of the *sadukkam* of Narayananar . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . Tirunarayanachcheri got it exempted from the payment of taxes and gave over (*this*) one-eighth *sey* (*of land*). This (*charity is placed*) under the protection of the great men of the great assembly.

**No. 120.â€” IN THE SAME PLACE**[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/parantaka_ii.html#_ftn9)

This is again a record of Rajakesarivarman dated in the 4^(th) year and must be attributed to Parantaka II, since it mentions the General Pirantakan Irungolar *alias* Siriyavelar.

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! In the 4^(th) year of (*the reign of*) king Rajakesarivarman, Pirantakan Irungolar *alias* Siriyavelar, paid 130 *ilakkasu* to the great men of the big assembly and gave, freed from payment (*of taxes*) (*adeyam*[\[10\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/parantaka_ii.html#_ftn10)) the following land for the sacred midday offerings to (*the temple of*) the god (perumanadigal) at Tiruvisalur in amaninarayana-chaturvedimangalam, a *devadana* and a *brahmadeya* on the northern bank (*of the Kaveri*), (*to last*) as long as the moon and the sun.

(L. 4.) (*One*) quarter (*veli of land)* . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . *kandam* on the western side of the sacred shrine (*sriykoyil*), (*forming*) the second *padagam* of the *sadukkam* of Bhavanandi-Chaturvedibhatta-Somayajiyar of Kunjapevil (*living*) in (*the quarter*) Tirunilakandachcheri and (*one*) *kani* (*of land*) in the village-site (*ur-irukkai) of Tiruvisalur, (forming)* the *nattam* portion of the *attakam* of Nandisvara Bhatta (living) in Srimadhavaracheri, â€” in all this quarter (*veli*) and (*one*) *kani* (*of land*) were given (*by him*) (*to last*) as long as the moon and the sun. (*The assembly of) all Mahesvaras shall protect (this charity).*

**No. 121.â€” IN THE SAME PLACE**[\[11\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/parantaka_ii.html#_ftn11)

This Sanskrit inscription supplies some additional information about \[Pirantakan\] Irungolar *alias* Sririyavelar mentioned in the two previous records. He is here called Siruvela the foremost member in the family of the daughter of king Pirantaka and the light of the Irungola race. The first of the attributes is interesting and has perhaps to be understood with reference to the marriage of a member of the Kodumbalur family named Samarabhirama to the Chola princess Anupama[\[12\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/parantaka_ii.html#_ftn12) mentioned in an inscription from Muvarkoyil. If this is so, it follows that Anupama was a daughter of king Parantaka I. It is also known that prince Arikulakesari, son of Parantaka I., married Pudi Aditta-Pidari, daughter of Tennavan Ilangovelar, another member of the same family which was called Irukkuvel, Ilangovel or Irungola.

In the 5^(th) year of king Sundara-Chola this chief Siruvela (*i.e*., Siriyavelar) is stated to have given to the god at Srivisalura (*i.e*., Tiruvisalur) some *mashakas* of gold for rice *offering* and the *gatanakas* (*gadyanakas*) which accrued to the king as revenue from the village Nimba or Nimbagrahara for repairs, and a lamp. Nimba or Nimbagrahara on the norlther bank of the Kaveri is apparently the modern Veppattur called Amaninarayana-chaturvedimangalam in Tamil inscriptions.

(Verse 1.) The light of his race, the fortunate one . . . . . . . .. . . . . . (*gave*) . . . . . . . . . .. . . .*mashakas* increased by five for offering in perpetuity cooked rice in midday to the god dwelling in the temple . . . . . . . . . . . named Srivisalura. (*He*) also (*gave*) for whitewash (i.e.,repairs) the *gantanakas* (*gadyanakas* ?) of the village Nimba, which were payable of the king.

(V. 2.) The king named Siruvela who was the light of the Irunkola race and the foremost (*member*) in the family of the daughter of (*king*) Pirantaka gave with delight a lamp to Hara (*Siva*) whose abode was at Srivisalura.

(V. 3.) May the *Mahesvaras* protect the lamp presented with delight in the prosperous fifth year of (*the reign of*) the best of kings, the illustrious Sundara-Chola, by him who bore the name Siruvela, to Isa (*Siva*) who was pleased (*to dwell*) in the abode (*temple*) of Srivisalura (*situated*) in the virtuous village named Nimbagrahara on the northern bank of the (*river*) Kaveri.
