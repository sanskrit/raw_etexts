2.  Saka-Samvat 1054 :
    Nidubrolu.[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/vikrama_chola.html#_ftn6)

**V. A Sanskrit inscription at Sevilimedu : 16th year.**

The Chellur plates of Kulottunga-Choda II.[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/vikrama_chola.html#_ftn7) and the Pithapuram inscription of Mallapadeva[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/vikrama_chola.html#_ftn8) stae that Vikrama-Choda was the son and successor of the Eastern Chalukya king Kulottunga-Cholda I. or Rajendra-Choda (II). The Pithapuram inscription adds that he bore the surname Tyagasamudra, that he went to govern the Choda country, and that after his departure the country of Vengi became devoid of a ruler. On the strength of these statements I have identified Vikrama-Choda with the hero fo the *Vikkirama-Solan-Ula,* in which his surname Tyagasamudra occurs, and with the Chola king Parakesarivarman, *alias* Vikrama-Choladeva, whose inscriptions inform us that he originally resided in the Vengai country and that he left it to ascend the Chola throne. The newly discovered Teki plates show that Vikrama-Choda was not, as was hitherto believed,[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/vikrama_chola.html#_ftn9) the eldest son of Kulottunga I., but a younger brother of Vira-Choda, the third son of Kulottunga I.[\[10\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/vikrama_chola.html#_ftn10)
As the two copper-plate grants which mention Madurantaka[\[11\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/vikrama_chola.html#_ftn11) do not contain the name of Vikrama-Choda, it remains doubtful whether his mother was Madurantaki or another of the queens of Kulottunga I.[\[12\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/vikrama_chola.html#_ftn12)
and, if the former should be the case, whether he came next to Vira-Choda in seniority or was another of the four younger sons of Madhurantaki.[\[13\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/vikrama_chola.html#_ftn13)

The Tamil inscriptions of Vikrama-Chola state that he left the North for the South and was crowned as Chola king.[\[14\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/vikrama_chola.html#_ftn14)
Professor Kielhornâ€™s calculations of the dates of his inscriptions in the Tamil and Telugu countries show that his coronation took place on (Approximately) the 29^(th) June A.D. 1118.[\[15\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/vikrama_chola.html#_ftn15)
Guided by his Tamil inscriptions, we can distinguish three periods in the career of Vikrama-Chola. The first of these was his expedition into the Kalinga country, which is mentioned in the first place in his Tamil inscriptions. On this occasion he defeated the Telinga or Telunga Bhima of Kulam,[\[16\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/vikrama_chola.html#_ftn16) who was apparently one of the Nayakas of Ellore.[\[17\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/vikrama_chola.html#_ftn17)
The Kalinga war is also referred to in the inscriptions beginning with poomaadhu punara[\[18\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/vikrama_chola.html#_ftn18) and in the *Vikkirama-Solan-Ula.* An unpublished poem in honour of Kulottunga II., states that Akalankan (*i.e.,* Vikrama-Chola), the son of Sungandavirtton[\[19\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/vikrama_chola.html#_ftn19) (*i.e.,* Kulottunga I.), â€œaccepted (from the author) the great poem (*parani*) about Kalinga.â€? This is a distinct reference to the historical poem *Kalingattu-Parani*, which describes the conquest of Kalinga by Kulottunga I. As Vikrama-Chodaâ€™s inscriptions place the Kalinga war not only before his coronation in A.D. 1118, but before his stay in Vengi, it must have taken place before the end of the reign of his father Kulottunga I.[\[20\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/vikrama_chola.html#_ftn20) and is perhaps identical with that expedition into Kalinga, which is ascribed to Kulottunga I. himself in his inscriptions and in the *Kalingattu-Parani*. This expedition seems to have taken place before the 26^(th) year of the reign of Kulottunga I., *i.e.,* A.D. 1095-96.[\[21\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/vikrama_chola.html#_ftn21)
