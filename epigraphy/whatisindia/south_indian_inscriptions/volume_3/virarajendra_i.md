[No. 81 to 82 Inscription at Tirunamanallur & Kilur](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_81_to_82_virarajendra_i.html)

[No. 83 to 84 Inscription at Tindivanam & Perumber](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_83_to_84_virarajendra_i.html)

In an earlier part of this volume, it was shown that Raja kesarivarman *alias* Virarajendradeva I., the victory at Kudalsangamam, must have reigned in the period intervening between the reigns of Rajendradeva and of Kulottunga I.,[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/virarajendra_i.html#_ftn1) and that, apparently, his immediate predecessor was Rajakesarivarman *alias* Rajamahendradeva,[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/virarajendra_i.html#_ftn2)
and his immediate successor Parakesarivarman *alias* Adhirajendradeva.[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/virarajendra_i.html#_ftn3)
Since then, Professor Kielhornâ€™s calculations of the dates of an inscription at Belaturu[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/virarajendra_i.html#_ftn4) and of another at Manimangalam (No. 29 above) have established the fact that Rajendradeva ascended the throne (*approximately*) on the 28^(th) May A.D. 1052,[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/virarajendra_i.html#_ftn5) while the reign of Kulottunga I. commenced (*approximately*) on the 9^(th) June A.D. 1070.[\[6\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/virarajendra_i.html#_ftn6)
Further, Professor Kielhorn has shown that the date of the Manimangalam inscription of the 5^(th) year of Virarajendra I. (No. 30 above) probably corresponds to Monday, the 10^(th) September A.D. 1067, and that, consequently, this king ascended the throne in A.D. 1062-63.[\[7\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/virarajendra_i.html#_ftn7)

That Rajamahendra reigned between Rajendradeva and Kulottunga I., may be concluded from an Alangudi inscription of the 6^(th) year of Parakesarivarman *alias* *Tribhuvanachakravartin* Rajarajadeva (II.),[\[8\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/virarajendra_i.html#_ftn8) which quotes successively the three following earlier dates : -

\(a\) Line 22. â€“ â€œthe third year of the lord Vijaya-Rajendradeva, who was pleased to conquer Kalyanapuram and Kollapuram and to fall asleep (*i.e.,* to die[\[9\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/virarajendra_i.html#_ftn9) in battle) on an elephant.â€? This statement must refer to Parakesarivarman *alias* Rajendradeva, who is known to have set up a pillar of victory at Kollapuram.[\[10\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/virarajendra_i.html#_ftn10)

\(b\) L. 55.- â€œthe third year of king Rajakesarivarman (*alias*) the lord Sri-Rajamahendradeva, who, while the law of Manu[\[11\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/virarajendra_i.html#_ftn11) flourished (*as*) of old, rescued the great earth from being the common property (of *other kings*), dispelled (*with his*) sceptre the dark Kali (*age*), and was pleased to be seated on the throne of heroes under the shade of a red parasol.â€?

Â© L. 63.- â€œthe thirty-fifth year of the glorious Kulottunga-Choladeva, who was pleased to rule after having abolished tolls.â€? This refers to Kulottunga I., who bore the surname Sungandavirtton,[\[12\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/virarajendra_i.html#_ftn12) *i.e.,* â€˜the abolisher of tolls.â€™

A lately discovered inscription of the 3^(rd) year of â€œking Rajakesarivarman *alias* the lord Sri-Rajamahaendradevaâ€? at Tirupapuliyur (No. 119 of 1902) opens with a short historical introduction, at the beginning of which it is stated that the king â€œby a war-elephant caused Ahavamalla to turn his back on (the bank of) the winding river." The mention of Ahavamalla as an opponent of Rajamahendra corroborates the conclusion derived fro the Alangudi inscription of Rajaraja II., that Rajamahendra must have reigned in the period between Rajendradeva and Kulottunga I. Among the kings who ruled in this interval according to the *Vikkirama-Solan-Ula*, there are only two whose identification is not self-evident, *viz.,* the predecessor and the successor of Virarajendra I.[\[13\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/virarajendra_i.html#_ftn13)
Consequently, Rajamahendra, the enemy of Ahavamalla, must be identical with the unnamed king who is alluded to in the *Kalingattu-Parani* and the *Vikkirama-Solan-Ula* as the predecessor of Virarajendra I. The subjoined table shows the reigns of Rajendradeva and his successors according to the present state of our knowledge.

| Rajendradeva[\[14\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/virarajendra_i.html#_ftn14) Parakesarivarman | 28^(th) May A.D. 1052 | 12^(th) year.[\[15\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/virarajendra_i.html#_ftn15) |

If the years given in the third column are added to the initial dates preceding them in the second column, it becomes evident that the reigns of these kings must have overlapped each other. The same had been the case with their predecessor Rajaraja I., Rajendra-Chola I. and Rajadhiraja I. As regards Rajamahendra, his reign seems to be covered altogether by those Rajendradeva and Virarajendra I. Perhaps he was a son and temporary co-regent of Rajendradeva. This was suggested already by an inscription of the 9^(th) year of Rajendradeva, which mentions among the boundaries of a village â€˜the road of Rajamahendra.â€™[\[19\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/virarajendra_i.html#_ftn19)
A further confirmation is furnished by the fact that his successor Virarajendra I. adopted the surname Rajakesarivarman. If this king had recognized Rajamahendra Rajakesarivarman as his right predecessor, he would, in accordance with all precedents, have assumed the title Parakesarivarman.
