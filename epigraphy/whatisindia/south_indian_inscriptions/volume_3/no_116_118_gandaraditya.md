This is again an inscription of Madiraikonda Rajakesarivarman dated in the 7^(th) year of his reign. It registers a gift of land by purchase, by two Vellala brothers of Onpadirruveli in Arkattu-kurram, a subdivision of Sonadu, to the Mahadeva temple of Tiruttandisvaram at Velichcheri.

Onpadirruveli may be identified with Ombattuveli in the Tanjore taluk of the Tanjore district. Arkadu which was evidently the headquarters of the subdivision Arkattu-kurram is now a petty village in the vicinity of Tirukkattuppalli.
