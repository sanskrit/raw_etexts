This and the next number together constitute one record of Parakesarivarman who is identical with Madhurantaka Uttama-Chola. The object of the inscription is to register the grant of certain lands to the temple at Tirunallam in Vennadu, which had been constructed of stone by queen Sembiyan-Madeviyar in the name of her husband Gandaraditya.
Prior to the date of this record she is stated to have laid out a new flower-garden for the temple by purchasing lands from the assembly of Tirunallam and getting them exempted from payment of taxes and to have increased the original provision for feeding Brahmanas in the temple.
The king also granted in the 3^(rd) year of this reign two *veli* of land for the upkeep of the garden and in the sixth year a further 16 *veli* for the expenses in connexion with the feeding of Brahmanas ( II. 24 to 26).

In the 7^(th) year and 240^(th) day of his reign when the king was encamped at Pichchankoyil, one of his executive officers named Parakesari Muvendavelan informed the former that the gift for feeding Brahanas was not sufficient and that a further gift of 12 *veli* of land had to be made. This was done accordingly in the 7^(th) year of reign (II. 23 to 40). A detailed description of the boundary line of the two *veli* and the 12 *veli* of land respectively granted for the maintenance of the flower-garden and the feeding house is given in 47 lines (II. 51 to 98). The privileges and exemptions granted in favour of these two lands occupy lines 99 to 115. With line 116 commences a new grant dated in the 8^(th) year and 143^(rd) day of the same king when he was encamped at Karaikkattu Panaiyur. The request now was for regulation of the expenses for all the income derived from the *devadana* lands of the Tirunallam temple. Accordingly, on the 151^(st) day of the same year the king ordered that specified amounts of gold and paddy collected as tax on the *devadana* lands of Tirunallam were to be deducted from the general revenue and that the number of Brahmanas who were fed in the feeding house be raised from 25 to 40, the additional being met from the remaining balance under a certain item provided from in the old regulations.

This brings us to the end of No. 151 which is engraved on the last section of the south wall and the adjoining section on the east wall of the temple which itself faces west. The two next sections on the east wall, two lines on the top of the north wall and a portion again of the east wall seem to contain the continuation. Consequently, on account of the irregular arrangement on the walls, this continuation is treated separately as No. 151A. It describes the regulated expenses referred to at the end of No. 151. As many as 4,151 *kalam* of paddy and lands, whose measurements are given in great detail, were provided for, in order to maintain the regular service in the temple, such as, the various dishes of oblations to the images, sandal paste, incense, lamps, the *sribali*-ceremony held on the natal star *jyeshtha* of queen Sembiyan-Madeviyar, feeding Brahmanas, pay (with cost of clothing) of the worshipper, the festivals *Margali-Tiruvadirai* and *Vaigasi â€“ visagam*, the pay (with cost of clothing) of Brahmanas who crushed sandal, the Brahmana servants who held the canopy (over the images) and rendered other necessary service, servants who picked up flowers and strung them, servants who swept the sacred temple and smeared it with cowdung, musicians, trumpeters, conch-blowers, watchmen of images, reciters of the *Tiruppadiyam* hymns, Brahmanas who attended to the general management of the temple (kovil-variyam), the temple accountant of the potter caste, the potter who supplied pots, the dyer (?) who dyed the sacred cloth (for the images), the Brahmana who carried the water from the Kaveri for the sacred bath, the official auditor who checked the temple transactions under orders of the king, temple repairs, the monthly sacred baths and the ceremonies on eclipses, renewal of screens and canopies, the purificatory ceremony called *Jalapavitra*, annual renewal of sacred cloths, the astrologer who recited the astronomical changes every day and carried the calendar (nalolai) with him, the pay (including cost of clothing) of the gardeners and of their assistants, the temple architect, the carpenter and the blacksmit, special worship for the images of Tripuravijaya, Vrishabhavahana and Ganapati and the sacred bath with the five articles, *viz.,* milk, curds, butter, sugar and honey. The extent of the houses occupied by the temple servants, hymners, priests, musicians, the temple manager and others, is also recorded.

The several officers of the king who legalized the grant by affixing their signatures, the immunities granted to and the privileges enjoyed by the donee, viz., the present Umamahesvara temple at Tirunallam, are of very great interest. The officers mentioned are the councilors (Karumam-arayum), revenue officers (Puravuvari), officers (in charge) of revenue registers (Varippottagam), revenue clerks (Variyilidu), *Mugavetti[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_151_uttama_chola.html#_ftn2)*, *Pattolai* and the Chief Secretary (*Olainayagam*). The privileges and immunities granted are almost the same as those mentioned in Vol. II, pp. 512 and 530 f. The scheme of the document was apparently a model on which the later grants recorded on the large Leyden copper-plates[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_151_uttama_chola.html#_ftn3) and other similar ones were drawn up.

(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! Udaiyapirattiyar Sembiyan â€“ Madeviyar was pleased to convert the temple of god Mahadeva (*Siva*) of Tirunallam in Vennadu into a sacred stone temple, bearing the sacred name of (*her husband*) the glorious Gandaraditya.

(L. 2.) For the land required to (*lay out*) a sacred flower-garden to the god, (*she*) obtained free of taxes, by complete sale, (*a portion of*) the land belonging to the members of the assembly of this village.

We were requested that, in order to (*make*) provision for *korru* and *pudavai* (*cloth*) money for the four persons who do work in the flower-garden made (*therein and called*) the glorious Gandaraditya and other flower-gardens, the two *veli* of Kiladakuvilai land in Vennadu with its income of two hundred and twenty-four *kalam* of paddy may be entered in the books from the 3^(rd) year (*or reign*), as a tax-free *devadana* for the maintenance of the flower-garden (*nandavanappuram*).

(L. 8.) We declared that the two *veli* of Kiladukuvilai land in Vennadu shall have its previous owners replaced and the tenants removed[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_151_uttama_chola.html#_ftn4); that it shall, inclusive of the *karanmai* and *miyatchi*, be a tax-free *devadana* for the maintenance of the flower-garden (*nandavanappuram*) of Mahadeva (*Siva*) at Tirunallam; that it shall be (*so*) registered in the accounts and receivefrom the 3^(rd) year (*or reign*) all immunities (*parihara*), not being subjected to the payment of any *antaraya* (taxes).
