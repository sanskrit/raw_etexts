**Translation of the Sanskrit text**

...(V. 51.) Encircled by the fire of whose prowess the Pandya king at once entered the sea, as if intent upon quenching that affliction in haste, abandoning (*his*) royal glory and (*his*) hereditary dominion.

(V. 52.) The fire of whose anger after burning (*his*) enemies quenched not in the waters of the sea (but) subsided (*only*) by the tears of the wives of the Simhala (*king*) who was cut to pieces and killed by (*his*) weapons.

(V. 53.) He built for Purari (*Siva*), who was before (*this*) on the silver mountain (Kailasa), a golden house called Dabhra-Sabha and (*thus*) put to shame his (*i.e.,* Sivaâ€™a) friend, the lord of wealth (Kubera) by (*his*) immense riches.

(V. 54.) His son Rajaditya defeated Krishnaraja in battle and went to heaven. His brother named Gandaraditya, whose feet were worshipped by the rows of diadems (*worn on the heads*) of the rulers of the earth, became king.

(V. 55.)
[\[1\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_205c_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn1)Arindama (*i.e., the destroyer of enemies*) bearing indeed a name which was full of meaning, became the best of kings; the dense forests became a abode of kings, who fled from his anger.

(V. 56.) From him was born the king known as Parantaka who received glowing prowess from the sun, profoundness from the ocean, great heroism from Hari (*Vishnu*) the abode of strength, an incomparable body from Kama (*cupid*), prosperity from Vishnu and from the moon a splendor pleasant to the eye.

(V. 57.) The mass of people believe this king to be Manu, who, out of love for the (*good*) conduct which was set forth by himself, has come to the earth once again to establish his law which had become lax under the influence of the Kali (*age*).

(v. 58.) While that emperor Sundara was ruling the circle of the earth, the syllable *ha* (indicative of sorrow) was heard by people only in words like *hara*.[\[2\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_205c_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn2)

(V. 59.) This (*king*), who was almost (*the god of*) Death of the Kali (*age*), considered the circle of the earth to be a more becoming jewel to (*his*) two serpent-(*like*) shoulders than golden armlets brilliant with flawless stones (*gems*).

(V. 60.) The courtyard about the portals (*of* *his palace*) was covered with the dust of gold-pieces which (*having*) dropped down during the great confusion (*ensuing on the occasion*) of (*the giving away of*) unlimited charities, were crushed to powder by the hoofs of horses.

(V. 61.) His son Arunmolivarma[\[3\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_205c_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn3) was born (*like another*) Murari (*Vishnu*) supporting on his two arms, long like the *prasa* (*weapon*), the glorious (*goddess*) Sri (*Lakshmi*) who closely embraced the whole of (*his*) body, and bearing on the palms (*of his hands*), the *sankha* and *chakra* in the form of auspicious marks.

(V. 62.) The eyes of people fully delighted in the extraordinary moon (*viz.,* his body) (*which maintained*) great pure luster in *both* the fortnights (paksha) \[*or* was of pure descent on both sides (maternally and paternally)\] and presented a very big (*i.e.,* *complete*), orb (always) \[*or* had an extensive kingdom to rule\].

(V. 63.) The Naga-women danced on the occasion of the birth of this emperor saying â€œthis (*king*) in all probability shall relieve our husband (*i.e*., Adisesha) of the weight of the earth on his head.â€?

(V. 64.) King Sundara-Chola of great prowess went to heaven, requested (*as it were*) by the assemblage of gods to protect (*it*) immediately from the attack of the armies of demons and demi-gods.

(V. 65.) â€œI am determined to follow my lord Sundara (*i.e.,* the beautiful) before (*he*) is coveted by the celestial damsels,â€? so saying zealously, his devoted queen the glorious Vanavanmahadevi, a very Arundhati in (*her*) manifold good qualities, abandoned her own people[\[4\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_205c_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn4) and followed him as \[night\] the day to heaven, afraid as it were of the allurement (of her husband) by celestial nymphs and (desirous consequently of) being near (him) even there.

(V. 67.) After him, his son named Aditya ruled the earth. He, who excelled the mind-born (Cupid in his (superior) beauty, killed the Pandya king in battle.

(V. 68.) Having deposited in his (capital) town the lofty pillar of victory (viz.,) the head of the Pandya king, Aditya disappeared (from this world) with a desire to see heaven.

(V. 69.) (*Though*) requested by the subjects (*to occupy the Chola throne*), in order to destroy the persistently blinding darkness of the powerful Kali (age), Arunmolivarman who understood the essence of royal conduct, desired not the kingdom for himself even in (*his*) mind, while his paternal uncle coveted his (*i.e.,* Arunmolivarmanâ€™s) dominions.

(V. 70.) Having ascertained by the marks (*on his body*) that Arunmoli was the lotus-eyed (*Vishnu*) himself, the able protector of the three worlds that had incarnated (*on earth*), Madhurantaka installed him in the office of heir-apparent, and (himself) bore the burden of (*ruling*) the earth.

(V. 71.) Applying (*his*) mind to (*the devotion of*) Sarva (*Siva*), utilizing (*his*) wealth in the act of performing His worship, (*employing*) all (his) retinue in the construction of houses (*i.e.,* temples) for Him, and directing (*his*) subjects to (*regularly*) perform His festive processions, (*showing his*) wrath (*only*) in the killing of enemies and (*distributing his*) riches among virtuous Brahmanas, that king (Madhurantaka) bore on (*his*) board shoulder, the (*weight of the*) earth.

(V. 72.) Arunmolivarman was himself then[\[5\]](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume_3/no_205c_aditya_ii_karikala.html#_ftn5) installed in the administration of the kingdom (*as if*) to wash away the stain of the earth caused by the Kali (*-age*) of his body (*bathed by the water during the ceremony of installation*) ; and the ends of the quarters heavily roared with the tumultuous sounds of the war-drums, rows of bells and bugles, kettle drums, tambourines and conches.

(V. 73.) (*Surely*) the milky ocean formed itself into a circle in the shape of (*his*) white parasol in the sky and came to see his (*own*) daughter Sri (*Lakshmi*) resting on the chest of this (*king*).

(V. 74.) Indeed ! the ladies of (*the lords of*) the quarters, who were taken captives during the *digvijaya* (*i.e.,* the conquest of the quarters), rendered (*their*) service to this victorious monarch with chowries (*made*) of (*his*) fame, lustrous as the shining moon-beams.
