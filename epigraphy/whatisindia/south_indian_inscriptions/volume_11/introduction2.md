**BOMBAY-KARNATAKA INSCRIPTIONS**

**VOLUME XI - Part II**

**INTRODUCTION**

As stated in the Preface, all the inscriptions published in this Part belong to the reign of a single ruler, nameslu, the Western Chalukya king, Tribhuvanamalladeva **Vikramaditya VI.** they do not add very much to our knowledge of the political history of the reign of this great emperor. Nevertheless, some of them throw welcome light on a few problems of chronology pertaining to his reign besides disclosing some new facts about the feudatories who flourished under his patronage. A review of these facts would, it is hoped, serve as a useful introduction to the part now being placed before scholars.

Two records of Vikramaditya VI, one from Amminbhavi, Dharwar District (No. 121) and othe other from Unachgeri, Ron taluk of the same District (No. 122) are dated Saka 993, Virodhikrit and Saka 994, Paridhavin.
These dates correspond to A.D. 1071-72 and 1072 respectively. Other records of Vikramaditya VI issued independently in A.D. 1071 have also been found. On these dates, it should be remembered, Somesvara II was still on the throne, which he occupied till A.D. 1074. It would thus appear that Vikramaditya VI virtually assumed independece as early as A.D. 1071 although he did not succeed in finally overthrowing his elder brother Somesvara till A.D. 1076. No. 206 of the present collection coming from Sirur mentions Tribhuvanamalla-Bhagalamahadevi, a queen of Tribhuvanamalladeva (*i.e.,* Vikramaditya VI). This princess is not known from any other source.

No. 124 from Morab dated Chalukya-Vikrama year 3 introduces the kingâ€™s younger brother *Yuvaraja* **Jayasimha** who is given the string of titles, Trailokyamalla Vira-Nolamba-Pallava-Permadi. The adoption of these Nolamba titles between Saka 986 (=A.D. 1064) and Saka 990 (=A.D. 1068) for the first time by a chalukya prince, who was none other than this Jayasimha, would indicate, that after the Nolambas ceased to exist as a ruling power, Jayasimha was made the viceroy of that region and held the tract of territory which had till then been the patrimony of the Nolambas. As fas as is known, this prince seems to have *Yuvarja* up to A.D. 1082 (No. 127) when he rebelled agaist his brotherVikramaditya VI and after this date nothing more is heard of him.

Some facts concernig *Yuvaraja* **Mallikarjuna,** son of Vikramaditya VI, gleaned from the present collection may be set out here. When Fleet wrote on the history of the later Chalukyas in his Dynasties of the Kanarese Districts he was not aware of the existence of this prince who was the eldest of the four sons of Vikramaditya VI, the other three being Jayakarna, Somesvara III and Tailapa. A doubt has arisen in the minds of some scholars as to whether Mallikarjuna and his uncle Jayasimha were both holding the office of *Yuvaraja* at the same time, somewhere about A.D. 1079. The Mutgi inscription of Vikramaditya VI published by Dr. Barnett is supposed to lend support to this possibility. For, this record which bears two dates, *viz.,* Chalukya-Vikrama year 4 (=A.D. 1079) and 35 (=A.D. 1110) mention *Yuvaraha* Mallikarjuna. It is know that on the earlier date Jayasimha was the *Yuvaraja* because, as stated in the previous paragraph, records applying to him the designation of *Yuvaraja* are found up to A.D. 1082.

 However, on a careful examination of the Mutgi record, it will be seen that the two dates cited in it relate to transactions that took place separately on these dates and that *Yuvaraja* Mallikarjuna is mentioned only in connection with the later transaction of A.D. 1110. Hence it would be erroneous to suppose that he was already a *Yuvarja* in1079 A.D. when actually it was Jayasimha who was holding this postion; in this capacity he functioned, as stated already, till probably A.D. 1082. It must be observed, however, that on an identical date in A.D. 1082, i.e., Sunday, 25^(th) December, both Jayasimah amdn Mallikarjuna are described as *Yuvaraja* in two records, one, of the latter at Aland in Hyderabad State. It israther difficult to account for this anomalous state of affairs of two persons of the same family holding the position of *Yuvaraja* on or before 25^(th) December 1082, the earliest date found for Mallikarjuna as *Yuvarja,* the news had not reached distant parts of the kingdom like the Dharwar region. The records of prime Mallikarjua discovered so far, including those in this collection (Nos. 139, 162) range from A.D. 1082 to 1123. Attention may also be drawn here to the titles *Malava-bala-balahaka-samiranam* (No. 139) and *Visala-raya-kuvara-javadandam* (No. 162), borne by him. Evidently the **Visalaraya** referred to here is to be identified with prince Visala of the Jalor branch of the Parmara dynastysince he was the only prince of that name who was flourishing in this incription is dated in this period. It is well-known that Vikramditya VI conducted one or more campaigns against Malwa which was at this period ruled bythe Paramaras.
It is notimpssible that the two epithets of *Yuvaraja* Mallikarjuna refer to this conflict with the rulers of Malwa and that this prince also took part in one of them and that Visaladeva of the Jalor family was his adversary. From the availabel records of the Paramara family no information is, however, forthcoming regarding Visaladevaâ€™s conflict with the Chalukyas. The Mutgi inscription referred to above, describes the chief **Vikramadityadeva,** lord of **Varchamanapura,** as the son-in-law of Mallikarjuna. Dr. Barnett has suggested that **Vardhamanapura** wa probably to be identified Wadhwan in Kathia war.
A more likely place would be Waddaman in the Mabbubnagar District of the Hyderabad State; this area was not far from Kalyna, the capital of the Chalukyas, and must have formed the core of their kingdom whereas Wadhwan in Kathiawar rather too far away from Mutgi, the centre of the chiefâ€™s activities. In all likelihood this was also the Vardhamananagari which the Kakatiya ruler Rudradeva is stated to have burnt. A record of Mallikarjuna, now preserved in the Bijapur Museum, contains certain verses which bear close resemblance in purport, diction and style to those found in the Kannada work *Pampa-Ramaayana* of **Nagachandra** *alias* **Abhinava-pampa.** On account of this similarity it has been conjectured that this poet flourished during the reign of Vikramaditya VI. It is not unlikely that the poet was the protÃ©gÃ© of *Yuvaraja* Mallikarjuna himself.

Four of the records (Nos. 128, 160, 177 and 211) edited here mention the **Kadamba** chief **Guvaladeva,** the feudatory of Vikramaditya, and range in date from A.D. 1082 to 1125. This Kadamba prince is to be idntified with Guvaladeva, the elder of the two sons of **Jayakesin** I mentioned in the Narendra Inscription of the time of Vikramaditya VI and Jayakesin II, dated Saka 1047, Visvavasu (=A.D. 1125).
