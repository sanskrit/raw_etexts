**No. 41**

**(B.K. No. 21 of 1926-27)**

**Nagavi, Gadag Taluk, Dharwar District**

**On A Slab Set Up In Front Of The Temple Of Nagarjuna**

The record which is badly damaged belongs to the time of **Nityavarshadeva** *alias* **Kottigadeva.** It mentions his **Ganga** subordinate **Satyavakya-Permanadigal** (i.e., **Marasimha II)** as governing the **Gangavadi Ninety-six Thousand, Purigere Three Hundred, Belvola Three Hundred, Kisukadu Seventy and Bagade Seventy.** A subordinate of his by name **Boluga** is described as the crest-jewel of the **Papakalla-kula.** The portion describing his exploits is completely worn out. But from what remains of it, it appears that he wrested from the **Pandya (king)** his golden umbrella and banner. The record registers a gift lf land, made by Boluga, on the occasion of **Lunar eclipse** which occurred on **Friday, Mrigasira-nakshatra, Margasira, punname of the year Sukla** corresponding to **Saka 891** (=**26^(th) November A.D. 969**) for imparting education and for maintaining a feeding-house (*satra*) in the temple of Ramesvara at **Nagavi.** The inscription was composed by **Samiyanna.**



**No. 42**

**(B.K. No. 1 of 1927-28)**

**Savadi, Ron Taluk, Dharwar District**

**On A Stone Leaning Against The Front Wall Of The Village-Chavadi**

The inscription belongs to the reign of **Kottigadeva** and is dated in **Saka 892** corresponding to the cyclic year **Pramoduta** (=**A.D. 970**). It mentions the kingâ€™s subordinate-**Marasingha-Permanadi** who was governing over **Kisukadu Seventy** and records the construction of a temple and a *mandapa* and th installation of a *linga* and the goddess Bhagavati therein, by Gangara Vatsayya and states that Sunkada Ballayya granted twelve *mattar* of land to the temple and two *mattar* to its manager (*sthanapati*). The charity of bengi Galdugarayya, son of Ballyya, called also **Balavarman,** is extolled. The record was composed by **poet Narana** and engraved by naganarya.

The English equivalent of the date quoted would be probably **A.D. 971, February**

**15, Wednesday.** The week day cited in the record is evidently a mistake.

**No. 43**

**(B.K. No. 149 of 1926-27)**

**Hirehandigol, Gadag Taluk, Dharwar District**

**On A Slab In The Temple Of Udachavva**

The inscription belongs to the reing of **Nitayavarsha Yasakkenallata Kottigadeva** and is **dated in Saka 893, Pramathin, current, (wrong for Pramoda)** i.e., **A.D. 970** when his **Ganga** subordinate **Marasingha-Permadi** was governing **Purigere Three Hundred** and **Belvola Three Hundred** provinces. It registers the regulation of tax, made on the day of Uttarayana-sankranti in that year by **Kontada Peggalayya,** a son of Vachchapayya, who was administering **Pandigola** as *achalapravaritti,* with the Gavunda Nagiyamma and the sixty persons of the place.

**No. 44**

**(B.K. No. 11 of 1928-29)**

**Aihole, Hungund Taluk, Bijapur District**

**On Two Stone Pillars, Set Up In The Compound Of The Huchchimalligudi**

The record belongs to the reign of **Kottigadeva** and is dated in **Saka 893 (expired) Prajapati (=A.D. 971).** It registers a gift of *gosahasra* made by Santa-Gavunda to the temple constructed by him on the **11^(th) day of the bright half of Paushya.** The corresponding English date would be **A.D. 971, December 30, Saturday.** Since the week-day is lost, this is not verifiable.

The inscription was composed by **Chandramauli-Bhalara.**
