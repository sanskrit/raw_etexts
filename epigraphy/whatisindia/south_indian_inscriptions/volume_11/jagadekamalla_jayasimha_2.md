**No. 57**

**(B.K. No. 140 of 1928-29)**

**Banasankari, Badamai Taluk, Bijapur District**

**On a pillar in the shrine of Siva to the Proer eLeft of the Shrine of the Goddess Banasankari**

The inscription refers itself to the reign of **Jagadekamalladeva (1).** It seems to commemorate the death, probably in a fight, of Senabova **Nagavarmmayya,** a trusted servant of **Bhimadeva** who was a scion of the **Rashtrakuta family** and a few others. Bhimadeva is described as a bee at the lotus-feet of **Ahavamalladeva (i.e., Taila II).** the scent-epephant of (his) *mava* (father-in-law or maternal uncle), â€˜the lion of (his) *bhava* (brother-in-law) and a Hanuma (i.e., Hanuman) of **Simha (i.e., Jayasimha II)** and a Sauparna (ie., Garunda) in valour. He is evidently identical with **Bhimarasa** or **Bhimaraja** who was governing the **Banavase, Santalige and kisukadu districts** under Taila (II) and Irivabedanga Satyasraya *(Dyn. Kan. Dists.* pp. 430 and 433).

The record is **dated Saka 941, Siddharthin, \* \* su. 5, Sunday.** In Siddharthin, su. 5 and Sunday combined on three occasions which correspond to (1) A.D. 1019, April 12, (2) A.D. 1019, September 6 and (3) A.D. 1020, January 3.

**No. 58**

**(B.K. No. 44 of 1927-28)**

**Nagarahalli, Mundargi Petha, Dharwar District**

**Round The Pedestal Of The Linga Surrounded By Five Images Of Bulls In The Temple Of Panchalinga**

The inscription which belongs to the reign of **Jagadekamalladeva (I)** mentions the Mahasamanta **Dasarasa** entitled â€˜Sigana Garudaâ€™ i.e., the eagle of **Singa (i.e., Jayasinha II,)** as governing **Maseyavadi One Hundred and Forty.** It registers a gift of land made by the king and **Nagama-Gavunda** of Dharmesvara constructed by Tribhuvana-Narayana Dharma-Setti. Since Dasarasa is called a son (*magam*) of Jagadekamalladeva he may be taken to be a favourite servant of the king, not hitherto known from inscriptions.

The record is **dated Saka 944, Dundubhi, Chaitra, su. 5, Sunday** which is equivalent to **A.D. 1022, March 10, Saturday.** Sunday is probably a mistake for Saturday.

**No. 59**

**(B.K. No. 176 of 1926-27)**

**Ron, Ron Taluk, Dharwar District**

**On A Slab Set Up To The Left Of The Entrance Into The Temple Of Kalamaesvara**

The inscription belongs to the reign of **Jagadekamalladeva(I)** and is **dated in Saka 944, Dundubhi (=A.D. 1022).** It registers a gift of lands made by Machimayya to the temple of Mulasthanadeva constructed by his younger brother Sankimayya at **rona.** Sankimayyaâ€™s father was **Aytavarmma** born in the family of Brahma (i.e., a Brahmana) and a resident of the *maha-agrahara* Rona.

**No. 60**

**(B.K. No. 272 of 1927-28)**

**Banasankari, Badami Taluk, Bijapur District**

**On A Pillar Lying In The Temple Of Banasankari.**

The inscription refers itself to the reign of **Jagadekamalladeva (1)** and purports to be the memorial pillar set up in front of the goddess **Banadadevi** by *Sahasa-Bhima* Manevergade **Ketimayya** on **Sunday, Vaisakha, ba. 8 of the cyclic year Raktakshin** falling in **Saka 946** (=**Sunday, 3^(rd) May, A.D. 1024).** Ketimayya is stated to be a servant of *Mahasamanta* **Dasarasa** who must be identical with the chief Dasarasa mentioned in No. 58 above.

**No. 61**

**(B.K. No. 60 of 1928-29)**

**Marol, Hungund Taluk, Bijapur District**

**On A Slab Set Up Inside The Temple Of Ramalinga.**

The inscription belongs to the reign of **Jagadekamalladeva (1)** and registers a gift of land made to a *basadi* at **Maravolal** (the modern Marol) by the **Nolamba** chief **Ghateyankakara** who was governing the **Nolambavadi and Karividi-Thirty** divisions. **Maruvolal** was under the administration of **Mahadevi,** a daughter of **Sattiga** (i.e., Irivabedanga Satyasraya). The Jaina teachers Anatanvirya-Munia who was versed in all the *sastras,* Gunakirti-Siddanta-Bhattaraka and his desciple Devakirti-Pandita are also mentioned. The record is engraved indistinctly in a cursive script.
