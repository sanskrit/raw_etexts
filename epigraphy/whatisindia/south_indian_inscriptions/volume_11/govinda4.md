**No. 34**

**(B.K. No. 162 of 1926-27)**

**Asundi, Gadag Taluk, Dharwar District**

**On A Slab Set Up Behind The Temple Of Udachavva**

The record refers itself to the reing of **Nityavarsha** and is **dated in Saka 847, parthiva** (=**A.D. 925*).*** Since Govinda IV was the ruling king in that year, it has to be surmised that he also had the surname *Nityavarsha* like his father Indra III. (See *Annual Report on Epigraphy* 1916, Pt. ii, para. 38). The inscription registers a gift of land made by Nagayya to a temple built by him while **Chandraprabha-Bhatara** of the Dhora-Jinalaya of **Ba\[nka\]pura** was administering **Pasundi** (i.e., modern Asundi) and nagapuli Gavunda was the head-man (of the village.)

**No. 35**

**(B.K. No. 13 of 1927-28)**

**Kavajeri, Ron Taluk, Dharwar District**

**On A Slab Set Up On The Tank-Bund**

The inscription belongs to the reign of **Suvarnavarsha,** *i.e.,* **Govinda IV** and is dated in **Saka 855, Vijaya** (=**A.D. 933**). It records several gifts made by Ballajja, the *Gavunda* of **Kovujagere** to the temples and *mathas* constructed by him at **Kovujagere, Belvanige** and **Evamgal.** The erection of a *gavikallu* for himself and the stone (-structures) for his two sons, mentioned in the inscription is note worthy. He is stated to have constructed five temples.
