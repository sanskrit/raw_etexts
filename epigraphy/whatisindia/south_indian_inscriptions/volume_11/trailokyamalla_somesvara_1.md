**No. 78**

**(B.K. No. 459 of 1926)**

**Mugad, Dharwar Taluk, Dharwar District**

**On A Slab Set Up On The Tank Bund**

The inscription refers itself to the reign of **Trailokyamalla Ahavamalladeva** (i.e., Somesvara I) and records the gift of some lands at **Mugunda** in **Mugunda-Thirty** made by the **Nargavunda Chavunda-Gavunda** to the **Samyaktaratnakara-chaityalaya,** constructed in the village by hi, for repairs, etc., and for the feeding of visitors. It also records the construction of *natakasale* (theatre) attached to the temple by *Mahasamnta* **Martandayya,** grandson of Chavunda-Gavunda. Mahamandalesvara **Chattayyadeva** of the **Kadamba** family is said to have been governing **Palasige Twelve Thousand** and **Konkana Nine Hundred.** Mugunda was, according to the record, situated in **Maharajavadi-nadu** a subdivision of Palasige Twelve thousand. The inscription gives a long pedigree of he Jaina spiritual teachers of the **Kumudi-gana.**

The inscription is **dated in Saka 966, Parthiva, Chaitra, suddha 5, Sunday.** It may be remarked that the year Parthiva corresponded to Saka 967. The English equivalent of the date would be **A.D. 1045, March 25, Monday;** f.d.t. .18 Sunday is evidently a mistake for Monday. A.D. 1007-8 was the only date for the chief Chattayya known so far. This record, therefore, extends his period by 37 years.

**No. 79**

**(B.K. No. 2 of 1929-30)**

**Alur, Muddebihal Taluk, Bijapur District**

**On A Hero-Stone In The Village**

The record refers itself to the reign of a **Trailokyamalladeva** and is **dated in Puthiva (Parthiva), Jyeshtha, su. 10 Tuesday.** It mentions a Mahamandalesvara named Gandabherunda manneya-vallabha **Siddarasa, Chika-Sahani** and Malleya-Sahani. The details of the date correspond to **A.D. 1045, May 28,** but the characters appear to be too late for this date. The date cited in the record is not correct for the reign of Trailokyamalla Taila III. It is not therefore possible to say with any degree of certainty who the Trailokyamall of the record is. The inscription is much damaged.

**No. 80**

**(B.K. No. 38 of 1928-29)**

**Arasibidi, Hungund Taluk, Bijapur District**

**On A Mutilated Slab Lying In The Suleragudi.**

The records refers itself to the reing of **Trailokyamalladeva** (i.e. **Somesvara I**) and is **dated in Saka 969, Sarvajit Chaitra, amavasya, Sunday, solar eclipse (=A.D. 1047, March 29, Sunday**). It registers a grant of land made by **Akkadevi,** while she was encamped at **Gokage,** to the **Gonadabedangi-Jinalaya** temple at **Vikramapura (**i.e. Arasibidi) and to Nagesena-Pandita of the Hogari-gachcha, the Varasena-gana and the Mula-sangha.

**No. 81**

**(B.K. No. 157 of 1926-27)**

**Bentur, Gadag Taluk, Dharwar District**

**On A Slab Set Up In Front Of The Hanuman Temple**

The inscription belongs to the reign of **Trailokyamalla Ahavamalla** (i.e. **Somesvara I**). It registers a gift of land and house by the Thirty-six Mahajanas of **Benatavuru** to Madimayya who died while rescuing cattle from one Madiraja who had captured them unjustly and was driving them to **Annigere.**

The record is **dated Saka 970, Sarvadharin, Phalguna, su. 5, Monday.** The English equivalent of the date would be **A.D. 1049, February 9, Thursday,** the weekday cited being a mistake. If, however, Sarvadhrin (=Saka 970 current) be assumed to be of the Northern cycle (which is not likely) the corresponding English date would be A.D. 1047, February 2, Monday; f.d.t. .120.

**No. 82**

**(B.K. No. 92 of 1927-28)**

**Sirur, Mundargi Petha, Dharwar District**

**On A Slab Set Up Near The Salisâ€™ Shop**

This record belongs to the reign of **Trailokyamalladeva** (i.e. **Somesvara I**) and is **dated** in **Saka 970.** It is mutilated and damaged. The object of the inscription seems to be to register some gift made by certain Gavundas for the benefit of the ascetics to a *matha.* Mahasamantadhipati Dandanayaka **Ma\[di\]nayya** is stated to have been governing five villages in the **Masiyavadi One Hundred and Forty** and Mahasamantadhipati **Dasarasa** who is called the *vajra* of Madi (i.e. Madinayya) was administering **Sirivura** (i.e. modern Sirur)
