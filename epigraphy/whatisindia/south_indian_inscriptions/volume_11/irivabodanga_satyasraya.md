**No. 50**

**(B.K. No. 62 of 1926-27)**

**Yalli-Sirur, Gadag Taluk, Dharwar District**

**On A Slab Set Up Near The Village Chavadi**

The record belongs to the reign **Irivabedanga Satyasraya,** who is stated to have been halting at a place called **Sitipstbsys** (Sriparvata), at the time of the grant. It mentions the chief Mahasamanta **Sobhanarasa** (already referred to) with the usual *epithets:* â€˜**kannana-banta,â€™ â€˜Kataka-prakaraâ€™** and â€˜a beet at the lotus feet of **Ahavamalladeva.â€™** He is stated to have been governing over the **Huligere Three Hundred, Beluvala Three Hundred and Halasige Twelve Thousand** (divisions). While his-subordinate **Lenka Benayya** was administering the toll-revenue (*sunka*) of **Sirivura, Soratavura Sabbi . .** (probably Sabbi Thirty) and the **Two Six Hundred** (divisions), **Sobhanarasa** gave, at the request of the Eight *Gavundas* and the Sixty Tenants of Sirivura, six *mattar* of land to **Revabbe-Goravi** of the temple of Mulasthana. This charter which is **dated Saka 926, Krodhin, Paushya, amavasya, Sunday, Surya-grahna,** having been broken, the gift was renewed later in the **thirteenth year of the reign of king Sarvajna-chakravartin Bhuvarlokamalla** (mistake for **Bhulokamalla i.e., Somesvara III**) in **Kalayautkta, on Paushya, ba. 7, Sunday, vyatipata, Uttarayana-sankramana,** by the Mahapradhana, Senadhipati, Pattalakarana, Dandayada-Heggade and Dandanayaka, **Mahadevayya,** at the request of his brother-in-law **Padmarasa** who was the *Heggade* of **Sripura** and a *Pradhana* and *Kannada-sandhivigrahi,* and at the request of certain *Gavundas* and the Sixty Tenants of **Muluvalageri.** This later *pratisasna* was given to Amritarasi-Pandita, the then *acharya* of the Mulasthana temple.

The first of the dates agrees with **Sunday** (mistake for Saturday), **January 13, A.D. 1005** and the second correctly corresponds to **A.D. 1133, December 25, Sunday.**

The date, **Saka 9\[2\]7, Visvavasu, Phalguna, amavasya, Sunday** (according to the *Ephemeris,* mistake for Saturday) corresponds to **A.D. 1006, March 2, Saturday.**
