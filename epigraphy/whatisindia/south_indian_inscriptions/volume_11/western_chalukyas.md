**No. 45**

**(B.K. No. 231 of 1928-29)**

**Kurhatti, Navalgund Taluk, Dharwar District**

**On A Slab Lying In Front Of The Temple Of Hanuman**

This inscription, which is much damaged, belongs to the reign of king **Ahavamalla (Nurmadi-Taila II)** and his dated in the year **Vikrama** which corresponded to **Saka 902 (-A.D. 980).** It refers to a family of local chiefs, descended from **Revanta,** among whom are mentioned: (1) **Kemcha,** who acquired by conquest (the) **Belvala** (country) wherein lay **Navilgundapura** (the modern navalgund); (2) his eldest son **Siri-Mudda;** (3) in their family **Piriya \[Ko\]ti-gavunda** who built a Siva temple and a \[Jai\]na-sala; (4) his son **Piriya Aycha;** (5) in his family **Tonda;** and (6) his eldest son **Kalidhurandhara** who pleased (king) **Kannaradeva** (probably the Rashtrakuta king Krishna III) by his valour. It mentions also the Vedic scholars Chaturvedi-Bhatta, Jataveda-Bhatta, Chamunda-Bhatta, also called **Gunanidhi,** born in the race of the Rishi Agastya, and his younger brother Ereyamma-Dikshita, who was versed in the **Lakula-siddhanta,** was a **sakta** and performed many sacrifices. The record registers the gift of the village **Karanaguripatti** as an *agrahara* to **Gunanidhi** and of some money and land made by the king and his subordinate **Sobhana** who was ruling over the **BelvalaPurikara** country. **Sobhana** is identical with *Mahasamanta* **Sobhanarasa** (*Dyn. Kan. Dists.* P. **432** and *Ep. Ind.* Vol. IV â€“ p. **205**)
Karanaguripatti is the modern Kurhatti, from which the inscription comes.

**No. 46**

**(B.K. No. 260 of 1927-28)**

**Hallur, Bagalkot Taluk, Bijapur District**

**On A Slab In The Basavesvara Temple**

This multilated and damaged inscription belongs to the reign of **Taila II** and is **dated in Saka 911, Vikrita *(=*A.D. 990-91**). From what remains of the record, it appears to be a copy of the Sinda inscription at Bhairanmatti published in *Epigraphia India* Vol. III, p. 232. Dr. Fleet thinks that Saka 911 is a mistake for Saka 912 (expired), *(ibid).*

**No. 47**

**(B.K. No. 111 of 1926-27)**

**Housr, Gadag Taluk, Dharwar District**

**On A Slab Set Up Near The Durgavva Temple**

The inscription belongs to the reign of **Ahavamalladeva (Nurmadi-Taila II).** It records grants of garden-land at **Eleya-Posavuru** (i.e., modern Hosur) made by **Koralagunda, -**the *manneya* of **Mulugunda Twelve** and the nalgavunda (i.e., nadu-gavunda) who belonged to the **Sinda race** and the **Kunnala family** and bore the snake-banner (*naga-dhvaja)* and the tiger-crest (*vyaghra-lanchhana)*-and the gavundas of **Mulugunda Twelve,** headed by Aycha-Gavunda, for the benefit of the temple of Mulasthanadeva at **Posavuru.** A certain **Ereyamma-Gavunda,** gave land for *vidyadana,* in the same temple.
The Mahasamanta **Sobhanarasa** (same as the Sobhana of inscription No. 45 above) was then ruling over the **Two Six-Hundred** (divisions). He bore the *epithets,* **Kannana-banta** and **Konkana-bhayankara.**

The inscription is **dated in Saka year 915, Jaya, Uttarayana-sankranti and solar eclipse.** In Jaya, which corresponded to Saka 916 according to the Southern cycle and to Saka o15 according to the Northern cycle, there was no solar eclipse on the Uttarayana-sankranti day which fell on Monday, **December 24, A.D. 994.** But there was a solar eclipse in this year on **Pushya, ba. Amavasya,** which corresponded to **A.D. 995, January 4, Friday.**
