**No. 1**

**Badami, Badami Taluk, Bijapur District**

**On A Rock Behind The Temple Of Mallikarjunadeva**

This inscription in Pallva-Grantha characters is much obliterated. Of the kingâ€™s name, only the epithet or surname â€˜**Mahamallaâ€™** is preserved, and the record has to be assigned to king **Narasimhavarman I** of the **Pallava dynasty** of Kanchi. It is dated in the **13^(th) year of the kingâ€™s reign.** From the characters it may be ascribed to about the 7^(th) century A.D. Badami is herein mentioned under the ancient name of **Vatapi.â€™** According to Dr. Fleet, the present inscription will have to be assigned to the end of the reign of Pulakesin II.

(Published in *Ind. Ant.,* Vol. IX, p 99. The revised text of the inscription is given below with a plate).
