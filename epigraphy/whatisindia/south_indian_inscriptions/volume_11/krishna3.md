**No. 36**

**(B.K. No. 175 of 1926-27)**

**Ron, Ron Taluk, Dharwar District**

**On A Hero-Stone Lying In The Taluk Office**

The record refers itself to the reign of Kannaradeva (i.e., Krishna III), and introduces his brother-in-law *(bhava)* Mahamandalika Permadi Butarya as governing the Gangavadi Ninety-six Thousand, Belvola Three Hundred and Puligere Three Hundred provinces in Saka 864 corresponding to the cyclic year Subhakrit. It commemorates the death of one Pampayya of the Vaji family and the \[K\]aundilya (Kaundinya)-gotra in a fight with Butayya-Permadi who had attacked Rona on Sunday the 6^(th) day of the bright half of Vaisakha (=24^(th) April A.D. 942).

It is worth noting that Butarya, i.e., the Western Ganga prince Butuga II was already in possession of Belvola Three Hundred and Purigere Three Hundred in A.D. 942, althought it is stated in the Atakur inscription (*Ep. Ind.*Vol. VI, p. 50) that these privinces were given to him by Krishna II in A.D. 949-50 in recognit9on of his having killed the Chola prince Rajaditya.

**No. 37**

**(B.K. No. 126 of 1926-27)**

**Kurtakoti, Gadag Taluk, Dharwar District**

**On A Slab Set Up In The Virabhadra Temple**

The inscription belongs to the reign of Akalavarsha kannaradeva (i.e., Krishna III). and registers gifts of land made to the temple of Mulasthadnadeva and Adityadeva of Kuritakunte by Lokayya while Nanniya-Ganga Butuga (II) was governing the Belvola Three Hundred and Purigere Three Hundred provinces. The epigraph is dated Saka 868, Parabhava, Karttika, su. 5, Sunday. The tithi quoted fell, according to L.D.S. Pillaiâ€™s *Ephemeris,* on Saturday, 3^(rd) October, A.D. 946.
We have seen above (No 36) that this Ganga prince was ruling over the two provinces in A.D. 942.

**No. 38**

**(B.K. No. 182 of 1926-27)**

**Naregal, Ron Taluk, Dharwar District**

**On A Stone Set Up In Front Of The Village-*****Chavadi***

The inscription refers itself to the reign of Akalavarsha Krishnarajadeva (i.e., Krishna III) and introduces his Ganga subordinate Butayya-Permadi who was governing the Gangavadi Ninety-six Thousand extending as fas as Peldore (i.e., â€˜the great riverâ€™). It registers the gift of a tank made to the *dana-sale* (charity house) attached to the *basadi* constructed by Padmabbarasi, a qeen of Butayya, by Na\[ma\]-yara Marasinghayya, on Sunday, Pausha, su. 10, Uttarayana-sankranti of the cyclic year Sadharana failing in Saka 873.
The gift was entrusted to Gunachandra-Pandita, a pupil of Viranandi-Pandita who was a disciple of Mahendra-Pandita of the Kondakundanvaya and Desiga-gana. The (Body of the) Eighteen Members (Padinenbaru) and the (Body of the) Sixteen Members (Padinaruvaru) were to protect the gift.

The record reveals for the first time that Butuga II had a queen named Padmabarasi besides the Rashtrakuta princess Revakanimmadi.

By the sankranti, the date of the record would correspond to Monday, December 23, A.D. 950.

**No. 39**

**(B.K. No. 72 of 1926-27)**

**Soratur, Gadag Taluk, Dharwar District**

**On A Slab Set Up In Front Of The Virabhadra Temple**

This is an inscription of Akalavarsha Kannaradeva who bears the *birudas* Anevedanga, Madagajmalla and Chalakenallata. It states that while his body-guard (*amgaraka*) Ruddapayya was administering Saratavura, Ruddapayyaâ€™s *Perggade* Achapayya and *Gamunda* Sami Kalteyamma granted in the presence of the Fifty *Mahajanas* and the *Urodeya* Pittayya, land and money for *vidya-dana* and for the expense of the *matha* attached to the temple there.

The gift was made on the occasion of an eclipse of the moon, on Sunday, Margasira, su. 15 of Saka 873 corresponding to the cyclic year Virodhi\[krit\*\] (=16^(th) November A.D. 951) and entrusted to the care of Bhimarasi-Bhatara.

**No. 40**

**(B.K. No. 113 of 1929-30)**

**Narsalgi, Bagevadi Taluk, Bijapur District**

**On A Slab Built Into The Front Wall Of The Hanuman Temple**

This damaged inscription refers itself to the reign of Akalavarshadeva (i.e., Krishna III) and is dated in Saka 886, Raktakshin, halguna, solar eclipse (=Monday, 6^(th) March, A.D. 965). It mentions the Mahasamantadhipati Ahavamalla Tailaparasa of the Satyasraya family as a subordinate of the king, governing Tarddavadi One Thousand as *anumgajivita.* He is also given the *biruda* Chalukya-Rama. A subordinate of his, claiming descent from the Khachara-kula is mentioned but his name is unfortunately lost. The record seems to register a gift of taxes to some god at Narasalage included in the Murttage Thirty division.

This is the first known inscrption that establishes the political relationship of the Rashtrakutas and the Western Chalukyas of kalyani before the latter obtained sovereigny in A.D. 973.
