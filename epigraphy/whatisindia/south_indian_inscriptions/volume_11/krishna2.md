**No. 19**

**(B.K. No. 59 of 1926-27)**

**Sirumja, Gadag Taluk, Dharwar District**

**On A Hero-Stone Set Up Near The School**

This damaged inscription belongs to the reign of **Akalavarsha (Krishan II)** and is **dated in Saka 805** (=**A.D. 883**). It records the death of a certain Ereyamman in a cattle raid at \[Ni\]vudi.

This is the **earliest inscription** known so far of the reign of Krishna II for whom A.D. 888 was the earliest date found hitherto (see Kielhornâ€™s *Southern List,* No. 81).

**No. 20**

**(B.K. No. 73 of 1926-27)**

**Soratur, Gadag Taluk, Dharwar District**

**On A Slab Set Up In Front Of The Virabhadra Temple**

The inscription which is **dated in Saka 805, Sobhakrit** (=**A.D. 883**) refers itself to the reign of **Akalavarsha Kannaran-Bhatara** (i.e., **Krishna II)** and mentions **Indapayya** as governing the *nadu,* evidently the **Purigere-nadu,** in which **Saratavura** was situated. It registers gift of a *gosasa* by Masigara-Chidanna in the presence of the assembly of the Fifty (*Mahajanas*) of Saratavura.

**No. 21**

**(B.K. No. 20 of 1926-27)**

**Betigeri, Gadag Taluk, Dharwar District**

**On One Of The Hero-Stones In An Enclosure Known As Mallayyana-Katte**

| \>  |

The record refers itself to the reign of **Akalavarsha** (i.e., **Krishna II)** and is dated **in Saka 814, Pramadi, Ashadha, su. 7, Sunday** (=**A.D. 893, June 24, Sunday**). It states that a hero named Kaligalla died in a battle when **Mangatorana** was governing **Belvola-nadu** and a lady, probably his wife, set up the monument.
The attack of Battakere (i.e., modern Betigeri) b a certain Nagadhora seems to have been the cause of the fight.

**No. 22**

**(B.K. No. 56 of 1927-28)**

**Mevundi, Mundargi Petha, Dharwar District**

**On A Slab Set Up In Front Of The Venkatesadeva Temple**

This record which is engraved in characters of the 11^(th) century A.D. bears the **dated Saka 818, Nala, Karttika, su. 5, Monday** (=**A.D. 897, October 3, Monday**) and purports to belong to the reign of **Akalavarsha** (i.e., **Krishna II**). A Mahasamnta (name lost) of the **Yadava-vamsa** who was, at the time, governing **Kogali Five Hundred** and **Maseyavadi One Hundred and Forty,** is stated to have constructed at the capital town of **Melividu,** a temple, probably of Koyagesvara, and to have granted land for the same to **Vedavahana-Bhattaraka.** The chief beasrs all the titles of Kuppeyarasa of the same family, who was a subordinate of Amoghavarsha I (see No. 12 above). **Melividu** is evidently the modern Mevundi where the inscription is found.

**No. 23**

**(B.K. No. 39 of 1927-28)**

**Harlapur, Gadag Taluk, Dhrwar District**

**On A Slab Lying In The Virakta-Matha**

The record is **dated in Saka \[8\]18, Nala** and refers itself to the reign of **Akalavarsha** (i.e., **Krishna II**). Since the record is worn smooth, nothing more can be made out.

**No. 24**

**(B.K. No. 104 of 1926-27)**

**Chinchli, Gadag Taluk, Dharwar District**

**On A Slab Set Up Near A Ruined Temple**
