**No. 182**

**(B.K. No. 78 of 1927-28)**

**Doni, Mundargi Petha, Dharwar District**

This inscription is dated **Chalukya-Vikrama year 23, Bahudhanya, Pushya, amavasye, Sunday, Uttarayana-sankramana, Vyatipata,** corresponding probably to **A.D. 1098, December 25, Saturday,** which was the day of Uttarayana-sankranti; the week day cited in the record seems to be an error. The epigraph registers a grant of tax-free land made by the Mahajanas, who were headed by the *Urodeya,* and the *Settis* of **Dronapura** to the god Siddhesvaradeva.
Saktisiva-Pandtia, the *acharya* of the temple, received the gift.

**No. 183**

**(B.K. No. 243 of 1927-28)**

**Shirur, Bagalkote Taluk, Bijapur District**

**On Te South Wall Of The Siddhesvara Temple**

This inscription is dated **Chalukya-Vikrama year 24, Pramathin, Phalguna, ba. 5 Sunday.** The date appears to be irregular. In Pramathin, Phalguna ba. 5 fell on Friday = A.D. 1100, March 2. If ba. 5 is a mistake for ba. 7, the equivalent would be A.D. 1100, March 4, Sunday. The inscription registers a grant of land made by Prasannarasi-Pandita, the *acharya* of the temple of Siddhesvaradeva, to the tank called Bahiesettiyakere. The plot of land granted formed part of the property of the god.

**No. 184**

**(B.K. No. 79 of 1928-29)**

**Galgali, Bilgi Petha, Bijapur District**

**On A Broken Stone Built Into The Wall Of A House Near The Parvatadeva Temple**

This fragmentary inscription is dated **Bira-Vikrama year 26, Vishu, Sunday,** the month being Adhika-Bhadrapada (not verifiable). It seems to record the death of Kannasetti in a raid. The district of Taraddavadi and the village Niduvani are mentioned. Bira-Vikrama year aparently stands for Chaukya-Vikrama year.

**(B.K. No. 221 of 1928-29)**

**No. 186**

**(B.K. No. 238 of 1928-29)**

**On A Slab Set Up In The Hanumantadeva Temple**

This inscription, whose beginning is worn out, is dated **Chalukya-Vikrama year 28, Subhanu, Dipavali-amavase, Sunday, Vyatipata.** In Subhanu, Dipavali-amavasya *i.e.,* Asvina-amavasya ended on Saturday = **A.D. 1103,** October 3. Probably the gift was recorded on the next day. A grant of land appears to have been made.
Mallikarjuna-Pandita is mentioned.

**(B.K. No. 32 of 1926-27)**

**Lakkundi, Gadag Taluk, Dharwar District**
