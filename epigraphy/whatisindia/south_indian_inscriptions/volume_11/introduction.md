**BOMBAY-KARNATAKA INSCRIPTIONS**

**VOLUME I - Part I**

**INTRODUCTION**

**T**he Part which is now placed before the scholars comprises texts of 118 inscriptions secured from the Dharwar and Bijapur districts of the Bombay-Karnatak during the years 1925-30. Of these one belongs to the Pallavas of Kanchi, four to the. Early Chalukyas of Badami, thirty-nine to the Rashtrakutas of Malkhed while the remaining seventy-four refer themselves to the Western Chalukyas of Kalyana up to the end of the reign of Bhuvanaikamalladeva Somesvara II. Most of these inscriptions are not previously noticed or published by that pioneer scholar Dr. Fleet whose *Dynasties of the Kanarse Districts* published in Part II of Volume I of the *Bombay Gazetteer* remains even to-day, though out of date, a monumental work on the historical account of the ruling dynasties of the Kannada districts. The discoveries of fresh epigraphs made in recent years by myself and Messers. R.S. Panchamukhi and N. Lakshminarayana Rao, furnish some new and important details in connection with a few kings of the families represented in them.

**THE PALLAVAS:**

The earliest important epigraph in this volume is the Badami Rock Inscription (No. 1), engraved in the Pallava-Grantha characters of the 7^(th) century A.D. The record is unfortunately mutilated owing to the effects of wind and rain to which the rock is exposed. But from what remains of it, it may be made out that Mahamalla \[Nara?\] simh who is described in the last 3 lines as the foremost Pallava king **\[Nara\]-simhavishnu** of the Bharadvaja-gotra occupied Vatapi and (probably seized) a pillar of victory standing in that place, in the 13^(th) year of his reign. It is to be regretted that the next two lines which are in the Chalukyan alphabet of the period, and contained to Saka year combined with the regnal year of the king are completely damaged except the portion â€˜*Sakavarshe shashtyuâ€™* i.e., Saka year . . . . . . .(increased by) sixty â€¦. This date, to fall in the 7^(th) century A.D. may be interpreted to range from Saka 560 to 569 in which case the *lacuna* may be supplied as *shashty-uttara-pancha-satatame eka* (up to *nave*)*dhike.* This would definitely place the occupation of Vatapi by Narasimhavarman I some time before or within the period Saka 560-69 (=A.D. 638-647), which must have corresponded to the 13^(th) year of his reign. Since the Chinese pilgrim Hieun Tsiang visited Maharashtra when Pulakesin II was at the zenith of his power, i.e., in about A.D. 639, the above mentioned event must have taken place only after that date. Fleet has, on the strength of the non-mention of the sovereign power in the Kaira grant of Vijayavarma-raja, assigned the Pallava occupation of Vatapi to sometime before A,D. 643 and this apparently receives direct support from the expression *shashty-utta\[ra\], etc.,* occurring in lines 7-8 of the present epigraph.

Another important point deserving notice in this inscription is that Narasimhavarman who is called in line 5 by the name . . . . simhavishnu evidently \[Nara\]-simhavishnu is stated apparently to have seized (?) a pillar of victory (*jayastambha)* at Vatapi. In the Velurpalaiyam plates of Nandivarman III, he is similarly described as having seized the pillar of victory standing in the centre of Vatapi *(Vatapi-madhye vijit-ari-varggah sthitan=jaya-stambham=alambhayad=yah).* It is, however, worth noticing that in no inscription of his family is this king called narasimhavishnu, whereas his name is specifically mentioned as Narasimhavarman. This pillar appears to have been planted by the Chalukyas at badami after having conquered the Kadambas of Banavasi to whose sway, the Badami region belonged. It may be noted that Mayurasarman, the progenitor of the Kadambas, was placed, by the Pallavas, in charge of the country bounded by Srisaila in the east and Prehara(?) in the west and as such the Pallavas appear to have claimed allegiance from the kadambas from the beginning of the latterâ€™s political career. The Kadambas are, however, stated in their inscriptions to have waged constant wars with the Pallavas (cf. *Pallava-pralayanalah* applied to Mrigesa varman in his Halsi plates)
When the Kadamba power was on the decline at the end of the 5^(th) century A.D. the Pallavas might have attempted to establish their authority once again in that region which was apparently resented by the Chalukyas who were probably the growing subordinate chiefs ruling over the Vatapi region under the Kadambas. The Chalukyas then meted out a crushing blow to their nominal overlords the Kadambas and other enemies, and as a signal of their unchallenged victory, planted the *jayastambha* in the heart of Vatapi. That the Pallavas had attempted to nip in the bud the rise of the Chalukyas is explicitly mentioned in the expression *akrantatma-balonnatim Pallavanam patim,* i.e., â€œthe Pallava king who had opposed the rise of his (i.e., Chalukya Kingâ€™s ) Powerâ€? occurring in the Aihole inscription of Pulakesin II. The must refer to the conflict of the two powers before the campaign of Pulakesin II against the Pallava kinds as recorded in the Aihole inscription. This is supported by the statement in the Mahakuta pillar inscription of Kirtivarman I that the king had vanquished the Dramila, among the several chiefs of South India, who must be no other than the Pallava.
The *jayastambha* mentioned in the rock inscription must therefore be taken to refer to the commemoration of the victory won by the Chalukyas over their enemies the Kadambas and Pallavas and it is but meet to infer from the sequence that the Pallavas attempted to recover their original territory by capturing the pillar of victory planted in their enemies, capital.

**THE CHALUKYAS OF BADAMI:**

Only three kings are represented in the inscriptions published here, viz., Vijayaditya-Satyasraya, vikramaditya II and Kirtivarman II. No. 2 which belongs to the reign of Vijayaditya comes from Kurtakoti in the Gadag taluk, Dharwar district, and states that the kings, officer Loketinimmadi was administering Kuruttakunte, i.e., modern Kurtakoti where the inscription is found. The name Loketinimmadi is made up *Loketi* and *immadi* of which the first component word is apparently a corrupt form of Lokaditya. If this surmise is correct Loketinimmadi would be a male officer. This receives an indirect support from similar names of officers, i.e., Lokate or Lokate occurring in *Mysore Archaeological Report,* 1911, page 38, and in the Byadgi inscription of Rashtrakuta Krisha II where in Lokate is mentioned as the son of Bankeya. The suffix *irmmadi* or *immadi* appears to have been applied to the names of female persons also as in the case of Revakanimmadi and Singannanimmadigal. No. e. refers to the siege of Jakkili by king Vijayaditya-Bhatara but does not mention the circumstances under which the event occurred. The Anniegeri inscription (No. 5) of **Kirtivarman** recounts that a Jaina temple *chediya* was constructed by Gamunda Kaliyamma at Jebulageri evidently a suburb of Annigeri, in the 8^(th) year of the kingâ€™s reign and that a *kirttana* (sculpture or more probably a statue) was set up in front of it by Kodisulara Kuppa *alias* Kirttivarma-gosasi. This incidentally testifies to the practice, then in vogue, of erecting statues in public places which is a common feature of perpetuating the glory of great persons, in modern times.
