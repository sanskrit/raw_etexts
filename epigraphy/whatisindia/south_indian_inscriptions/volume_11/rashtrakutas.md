**No. 6**

**(B.K. No. 148 of 1926-27)**

**Belhod, Gadag Taluk, Dharwar District**

**On A Slab Set Up Behind The Temple Of Isvara**

The record is not dated. It refers itself to the reign of **Prabhutavarsha Jagattunga.** These *birudas* or *surnames* were borne by three kings of the Rashtrakuta family, viz., Govinda II, Govinda III and Govinda IV. But since the characters are too early for the period of Govinda (IV), the inscription must be assigned either to the reign of Govinda II or of Govinda III, probably the latter. It records the gift of a *gosahasra,* evidently at Belhode.

**No. 7**

**(B.K. No. 59 of 1928-29)**

**Kesarabhavi, Hungund Taluk, Bijapur District**

**On A Stone Set Up Near Th Temple Of Hanuman**

The kingâ€™s name which is damaged ends in **varsha.** Since the record is **dated in Saka 759** (=**A.D. 837**), it may be assigned to the reign of **Amoghavarsha I** (A.D. 814-15 to 877-78). It mentions a daughter (name lost) of the king who was perhaps the wife of **Yeraganga** who was ruling over the **Edadore** and other districts.

The details of date given in ll. 1-4 and 23-24 are: Saka 759 (expired), Jyeshtha, ba. 14, Wednesday. The given *tithi* fell on Tuesday (not Wednesday), .90. the date would correspond to A.D. 837, June 5, Tuesday. The cyclic year must be Pingala.

**No. 8**

**(B.K. No. 92 of 1929-30)**

**Huvina-Hippargi, Bagevadi Taluk, Bijapur District**

**On A Broken Pillar Lying Near The Entrance Into The Village**

The record belongs to the reign of **Amoghavarsha I** and is **dated in Saka 784, Chitrabhanu (=A.D. 862).** It registers the gift of the village **Pipparage** (i.e., modern Huvina-Hippargi) situated in the **Kannavuri-vishya** to the astrologer Goleya-Bhatta. The gift is stated to be a *Ratta-maltanda (martanda)-datti,* thus supplying us with a hitherto unknown *biruda* of the king, *viz.,* **Ratra-maltanda (Ratta-martanda).**

**No. 9**

**(B.K. No. 93 of 1929-30)**

**On The Same Pillar**

This and the previous record appear to refer to the same gift. The genealogies of the king and the donee and the boundaries of the village granted, ie., Puvina-Pipparage are here given in detail. And the occasion for making the gift to Goleya-Bhatta is stated to be the *tulapurusha* ceremony performed by the king who is called **Amoghavarsha** and **Nirpatinga-Vallabha,** at the time of a **solar eclipse.** The date of these two records would therefore be **A.D. 862, August 28, Friday** which was the day of the only solar eclipse in the year Chitrabhanu.

**No. 10**

**(B.K. No. 152 of 1926-27)**

**Bentur, Gadag Taluk, Dharwar District**

**On A Hero-Stone Built Into The Wall Of The Annadanappa Tuparisâ€™s House**

The inscription which is **dated in Saka 785, Tarana** (=**A.D. 864**) belongs to the reign of **Amoghavarsha I.** Since a larger portion of the record is seriously damaged, the contents cannot be properly made out. A grant of land seems to have been made to hero named Chikanna.
Incidentally the record refers to the observance of *vratas* and *sanyasana.*

**

**No. 11**

**(B.K. No. 60 of 1927-28)**

**Mevundi, Mundargi Petha, Dharwar District**

**On A Slab Set Up In Front Of Th Basavanna Temple**

The inscription refers itself to the reign of **Amoghavarsha I** and is **dated in Saka \[7\]86** (=A.D. 865). It mentions **Kuppeyarasa** of the **Yadava-vamsa.** From the Soratur inscription (*Ep. Ind.,* Vol. XIII, p. 77) we know that he was ruling the Purigere-nadu as a feudatory of the king. It is evident from the present record that â€˜Advaâ€™ the family name of this chief occurring in the Soratur epigraph is only a corruption of â€˜Yadavaâ€™.
