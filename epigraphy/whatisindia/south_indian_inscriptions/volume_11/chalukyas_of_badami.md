**(B.K. No. 18 of 1928-29)**

This damaged and undated inscription belongs to the reign of the king **Vikramaditya-Bhatara** and mentions **Ayyavole** (i.e., the modern Aihole). The writer was Chandradeva. In the absence of the date it is not possible to assign the epigraph definitely to Vikramaditya I or Vikramaditya II. Probably it belongs to the latter.
