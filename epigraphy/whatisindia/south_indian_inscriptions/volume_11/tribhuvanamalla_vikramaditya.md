**No. 119**

**(B.K. No. 186 of 1926-27)**

**Naregal, Ron Taluk, Dharwar District**

**On A Slab Inside The Temple Of Kalamesvara**

This inscription refers itself to the reing of **Tribhuvanamalladeva (Vikramaditya VI)** and places on record the gift of land made by Mundeyara Sri\[va\]nta-Gavunda on the specified date to Nilakantha Panditadeva, for the benefit of the temple of Mulasthanadevam built by him in the centre of the southern quarter of **Narayamgal.** At the time of recording the grant the **Sinda** Mahamandalesvara **Permadidevarasa** was ruling over **Kisukadu Seventy, Kelavadi Three-Hundred, Bagadage Seventy** and **Narayamgal Twelve,** from his capital at **Erambarage.** It is known from a record at Kodikop, a hamlet of Naregal (N.K. No 194 of 1926-27), that the chief was administering the same tract in A.D. 1144 under the Western Chalukya ing agadekamalla II(*J.B.B.R.A.S., Vol.* XI)

The character is dated **Saka 872, Saumya, Pushya, su. Punnami, Monday, lunar eclipse** and **Uttarayana-sankranti.** The details are vey irregular. In Saumya according to te Southern cycle, Pushya full-moon fell on Monday but the tithi ended at. 06. There was no lunar eclipse or Uttaryana-sankranti on this day. But in the previous year, *i.e.,* Kilaka, which was Saumya, according to the Northern Cycle Pushya-punnami commenced at 11 on Monday; but there was no eclipse on this day and the Uttarayana-sankranti occurred only five days later. But on the following, *i.e.,* Magha-purnima, there was a lunar eclipse. Taking Saumya by the Northern Cycle, the week-day ad tithi would yield the English date **Monday, December 18, A.D., 948.**

**No. 120**

**(B.K. No. 214 of 1926-27)**

**Yeribyateri, Ron Taluk, Dharwar District**

**On A Stone Set Up In Front Of The Temple Of Ramalinga**

This much damaged inscription belongs to the reing of **Tribhuvanamalla-Permadideva (Vikramaditya VI)**. It refers to a subordinate who belonged to \[Papakalla-kula\] and records a gift to the gof of **Balera** Jogesvarada Mulasthana and to the god Bolesvara. It entions Chavunda-Gavunda, Joma-Gavunda, Joga-Gavunda and Jakkeyabe.

The record is date **Saka 968, Parthiva, paushya, su. \[2\], Sunday, Uttrayanasankramana.** In Parthiva, the sankramana fell not on Sunday but on Tuesday (=December 24, A.D. 1045). But in the previous year, i.e., Tarana, it fell on Sunday, Paushya, su. 1 +Sunday, December 23, 1044 A.D. The latter appears to be the more probable date of the record.

Since the date falls during the first year of the reign of Trailokyamalla Somesvara I, the father of Vikramaditya VI, it is not possible to account for the imperial titles applied to the latter as early as A.D. 1044.

**No. 121**

**(A.R. No. 431 of 1926)**

**Amminbhavi, Dharwar Taluk, Dharwar District**

**On A Slab Built Into The Ceiling Of The Central Shrine Of The Jain Basti**

This damaged inscription purports to belong to the reing of **Tribhuvanamalladeva (Vikramaditya VI)** and refers to his subordinate Mahamandalesvara **Jayakesideva,** who was then ruling over **Konkana Nine-hundred, Palasige Twelve-Thousand** and **Kundur Five-Hundred** from his capital at Govage (Goa). It seems to record the foundation of Siva temple at Ammayanabhavi, an *agrahara* in Kundur-nadu and registers a gift of rice made for offerings in the temple by Machi-ya\[nna\] and others.

The record is date **Saka 993, Virodhakrit, . . . .. . pamchami, Sunday, vyatipata.** The month is lost. During the year, *panchami* combined with Sunday on the following occasions:-

(1) Jyeshtha, ba. 5 = May 22,

(2) Ashadha, su. 5 = June 5

(3) Nija-Asvina, ba. 5 = October 16,

(4) Karttika, su. 5 = October 30,

(5) Phalguna, su. 5 = February 26,

(6) Phalguna, ba. 5 = March 11, A.D. 1072.
