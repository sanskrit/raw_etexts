**TEXT OF INSCRIPTIONS**

**No. 91**

(*A. R. No*. 601 *of* 1929-30)

**VARAMBAḶḶI, UDIPI TALUK, SOUTH KANARA DISTRICT**

Slab set up in the field called Chandraseṭṭi-gadde by the roadside

**Dēvarāya I, 1417 A.D.**

 This is dated **Śaka 1339, Durmukhi, Chaitra śu. 1, Thursday.** In the cyclic year Durmukhi corresponding to Śaka 1338, the given *tithi* occurred on 1416 A.D., February 29, when the Weekday was Saturday. But in the next year, Hēmāḷambi (Śaka 1339) the given details correspond to **1417 A.D., March 18, Thursday f.d.t. .62.** The latter seems to be the intended date.

It registers a gift of land in Voramballi, an *adhivāsa* of Brahmūru, to Bichaḷadēva, son of Sōvarasa of Bhāradvāja-gōtra by Nāraṇ-orambaḷḷi son of Vishṇ-ōrambaḷḷi who was the *grāmiṇi* of the western portion of Brāhmūru. It states that**Śaṅkaradēva-oḍeya**was governing **Bārakūru-rājya.** Sāyappaṇṇa son of Dēvappa wrote the record, while the mason Dharaṇi (?), son of Malagōja engraved it.
