**TEXT OF INSCRIPTIONS**

**No. 142**

(*A. R. No*. 519 *of* 1928-29)

**HACHAVEṬṬU, KARKALA TALUK, SOUTH KANARA DISTRICT**

Slab set up in a field called Kallagaṇḍa

**Virūpāksha, 1466 A.D.**

**** This record is dated **Śaka 1326, Tāraṇa, Makara 6, Thursday**, solar eclipse. These details correspond to 1406 A.D., January 1. But this date is very early for Virūpāksha. If the Śaka year is a mistake for 1386, then the date falls in the reign period of this king, the *tithi* corresponding to **1465 A.D**., **January** 1, when the weekday was Tuesday. No eclipse occurred on that day. In the next year (1406 A.D., Pārthiva) the *tithi* occurred on January 2, Thursday, though even on that date the said eclipse did not occur. The latter might be the intended date.

It registers a gift of land Mahādēva of Yiṭṭāla, for worship, burning a perpetual lamp and feeding 36 brāhmaṇas daily in the month of Siṁha, by Kānteṇa Mārāḷuva *alias* Koṁṇa.
