**No. 97**

(*A. R. No*. 265 *of* 1931-32)

**HOSĀḶA, UDIPI TALUK, SOUTH KANARA DISTRICT**

Slab set up at Kannugadde near Chauḷikēri

**Dēvarāya II, 1423 A.D.**

****This is dated **Śaka 1315, Śōbhakṛit, Kārttika śu. 12, Sunday.** The given *tithi* corresponds to **1423 A.D., October 16** when the weekday was Saturday. This appears, however, to be the intended date.

****It registers a gift to god Vināyaka of Kellaṁgere by Nāraṇa-seṭṭi- son of Kōṭiyaṇṇa-seṭṭi of Chauḷiya-kēri, on the occasion of *uthāna- dvādasi*. The nature of the gift cannot be made out as the latter part of the record is damaged. It states that **Virupaṇṇa-voḍeya** was governing **Bārakūru-rājya** during this time.
