**SUPPLEMENTARY INSCRIPTIONS**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
^(\[1\]) We should read here either *sadyaḥ, or adya,* dropping the *visarga.*  
^(\[2\]) It is incorrect as it should be *-nṛita-,* but it cannot be known whether it is a mistake in the original or in the transcript.  
^(\[3\]) This verse is separate from the preceding one is only conjectural from Lele’s transcript. It is not possible to know if some more *aksharas* are lost here.  
^(\[4\]) One long letter is missing after da.  
^(\[5\]) Prosodically, the bracketed letter should be long.  
^(\[6\]) Read ![](srs40.JPG).  
^(\[7\]) *Sandhi* is violated here.  
^(\[8\]) As the stone is broken on both the vertical sides, it is not possible to ascertain as to how many of these letters are lost at the end of this line and how many at the beginning of the next line. This is to be noted in cases of the other breaks also.  
^(\[9\]) Read ![](srs41.JPG).  
^(\[10\]) Probably the date was given in the end. The break in this verse may perhaps indicate that the gift was made by the king Subhaṭavarman, whose name was possibly shown, for metrical exigencies, by the letters *Suvarmaṇā* just fitting at the end of the first hemistich of the stanza. This is also justified by taking ![](srs42.JPG) as one compound word, taken a two by Lele, which cannot be construed properly.
