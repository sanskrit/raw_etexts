**SUPPLEMENTARY INSCRIPTIONS**

**2nd or 9th of the** **month, dark half, Saturday, the latter being equivalent to the 16th of February, 1213 A.C.** However, it may be remarked here that according to the scheme of the current and expired year and also that of the pūrṇimānta and amānta month, the number of alternatives, with Saturday, may be multiplied, and in view of this, we cannot be definite on this point.

The latest known year of Trailōkyavarman’s reign is supplied by the Dhurēti copper-plate, dated in the Kalachuri year 967, equivalent to 1212 A.C. The month given in it corresponds on May ;^(\[1\]) and the importance of the present record is in that it furnishes for the ruler a date which is above 8∙9 months later.^(\[2\]) It is also the only record of this king’s reign available so far at Ajaygaḍh itself.

No. 192 ; PLATE CLXVIII  
**AJAYGAḌH STONE IMAGE INSCRIPTION OF THE TIME OF VIRAVARMAN Vikrama** Year 1335

THIS inscription was brought to light by N. P. Chakravarti by mentioning its purpose and date, in the *Annual Report of the Archaeological Survey of India,* under Epigraphy, for 1935-36, p. 92. It is edited here for the first time from a photograph kindly supplied to me, at my request, by Shri B C. Jain, Deputy Director of Archaeology in the State of Madhya Pradesh.

The record is incised, as we learn from Chakravarti’s report, on the pedestal of a colossal image of Śāntinātha in a ruined Jaina temple, to the west of the Ajaypāl tank, on the fort of **Ajaygaḍh** in the Pannā District of the Vindhya Division of Madhya Pradesh. The inscribed portion measures about fifty cms. broad by nine cms. high. The size of the letters gradually decreases in each of the lines, which are four in all, till in the latter half of the last line it is almost half of those employed in the first line. The preservation of the record is satisfactory, except that four letters at the end of l. 2 and three at the end of l. 3 are totally lost.

The **script** is Nagarī of the thirteenth century to which the record belongs. Worth noting from the **palaeographical** point of view are the somewhat similar forms of *ch* and *v,* as in *cha* and *vāṇī,* both in l. 3, and the slightly varying bend of the horn of *dh,* as in *sādhu* and *Madhurā,* in ll. 2 and 3 respectively. The consonant s is occasionally written so as to resemble *m, e.g.,* in *Masala* and *sadhu,* both in l. 2.

The **language** is Sanskrit ; the inscription is all in prose, excepting two verses in the concluding portion. The **orthography** calles for no remark, except that the class consonant preceded by *r* is
