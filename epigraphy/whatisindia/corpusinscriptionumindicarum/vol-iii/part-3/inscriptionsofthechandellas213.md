¹ Here is a reference to Pārtha’s putting to flight the enemies capturing Uttara’s cows, for which see *Mbh., Virāṭa Parva.*  
² For the *visarga* dropped- here, see *n.* 20, above.  
³ A *kalpa* is a day of Brāhmā, extending over thousand *yugas.* Here it is suggested that the king may live long for a *kalpa* and even longer that the Sun, the moon and the stars taking their birth and coming to an end many time in one *kalpa.*  
⁴ Kielhorn observes that this letter might be read as *mvi.* It seems to me, however, that the reading is intended to be *sēshān=vidhāya* meaning that having made the remaining of (the Brāhmaṇas) *śeshā, i.e., śēshavat ādhārabhūtān,* indicating their stay to be permanent. The word *śēsha* is used here in a double sense.  
⁵ Read *chakrē dvayaṁ.*  
⁶ Kielhorn explained it to mean “the sanctuary of the temple rising from the small hall”. But the context shows that here the word denotes the share which was due to the Brāhmaṇa, out of that collected in the customs house *(maṇḍapikā).* Compare *dēvōttara,* meaning rent-free holding in the possession of a god.  
⁷ Kielhorn translated this word as ‘the tribe of attendants’, and admitted that he could not quote any authority for this. *Pāda* here means feet (of the gods), and *kula* denotes abode, *i.e.,* the temple. The word thus appears to mean ‘a group of worshippers’. A worshipper is called *pādamūla* in the Sirpur inscription (E. I., XI, p. 192) and is probably connected with it. *Pāda-mūla* is of course primarily the foot-print *(Pādukā).* Cf. *Rāmagiri-svāminaḥ pādamūlāt* in the Ṛiddhapur plates of Prabhāvatī-Gupta. for which, see *C. I. I.,* Vol. V. p. 35. Text-line 1, translated as ‘foot-prints’.  
⁸ The word is unknown to the dictionaries and Kielhorn also noted his inability to explain it.
