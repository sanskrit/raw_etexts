¹ Read ![](nitro14.JPG).  
² Originally *vi,* corrected to *vē.*  
³ These *aksharas* are indistinct and the reading is probable, as also stated by Kielhorn. They were read by Hultzsch as *sasētuḥ.*  
⁴ This is as read by Kielhorn, but the reading is metrically defective. The traces, however, point out that *rāśēr* may have been intended. In this verse the word *mitra* is used in its double sense, viz. (1) friend and (2) the Sun. Similarly *dvija* means a twice-born and also a bird. A metaphor is employed in this verse.  
⁵ Kielhorn’s Query-mark after this letter shows that in his time it was already in traces. It has now totally disappeared and here I have adopted his reading. However, the whole word *ēva* appears to be redundant here so far as the sense is concerned.  
⁶ The words *dvijarāṭ* and *Trinētra* are used here in *double entendre,* the first, meaning (1) twice-born and (2) the moon; and the second meaning (1) three-eyed and (2) Śiva. Kielhorn has explained this verse to means that by this person his master Paramardin became the lord with three eyes, *i.e.,* Śiva, on earth, he being the third eye of the king. But the full significance of the stanza may be brought out also by observing that Paramardin honoured this man as Śiva honours the moon by placing him above his forehead. Similar expressions we often find in inscriptions, *e.g.,* cf. *Dhaṅgarājēna mānyaḥ* in No. 99, v. 1, above. For similar idea, also see No. 60, v. 52.  
⁷ From the traces that now remain, these three *aksharas* cannot be made out. Kielhorn read ![](nitro15.JPG), but the second *akshara* is metrically required to be long and the impression before me shows it to be *jyā.* The conjectural restoration here would be ![](nitro16.JPG).  
⁸ Kielhorn read ![](nitro17.JPG) and corrected it to ![](nitro18.JPG), but I do not see the sign of the *mātrā* in the second syllable.  
⁹ This word is used in its double meaning (1) Brāhmaṇa and (2) the moon, as some other words also in this stanza.  
¹⁰ The sky is known to be the middle stride of Vishṇu (Vāmana). In the same sense it is also used above. in No. 33, v. 2.  
¹¹ By *double entendre,* the expressions used in this verse are applicable to the person and also to Vishṇu, that is Purushōttama, as he was  
named.
