**INSCRIPTIONS OF THE CHANDELLAS OF JEJAKABHUKTI**

**ḌUBKUṆD STONE INSCRIPTION OF THE TIME OF VIKRAMASIṀHA**

stone which is now preserved in the Central Museum, Gwalior,¹ and two impressions, one of which was supplied to me by the Curator of the Museum and the other by the Superintending Archaeologist at Bhopal.²

The place, where the inscribed stone was found, lies in a dense forest and is situated about 70 kms. west-northwest of Shivpurī, on the top of a table-land, 122 kms. due south-west of Gwālior, the actual distance by road being about 160 kms. It is on the left bank of Kunu, a tributary of the Chambal. The inscription was seen by Cunningham’s draftsman, on one of the pilasters in the south cloister of an old temple standing in the midst of an enclosure surrounded by the remains of several small temples.³

The total height of the pilaster is 112 cms., and it is 47∙7 cms. broad. The inscription contains 61 lines of writing which covers a space 42∙5 cms. broad by 100 cms. high. It is in a state of fair preservation, with the exception of a few aksharas in the first two lines where parts of the surface of the stone have peeled off. Some of the aksharas are here and there damaged, but they can be made out from the context, with the exception of two at the commencement of l. 7 and one in l. 15. Nothing of historical interest, however, is lost. The size of the letters is between 1∙1 and 2∙5 cms.

The **characters** are Nāgarī of the eleventh century A.C. Attention may be drawn to the formation of some of the letters. The initial *a* is written in two different ways ; cf. *e.g., adhyāsya,* l. 9 and *ajani,* l. 21 ; in a singular instance in *dyuti-,* l. 16, the medial short *u* appears in the middle in right as attached to *r* in *guru* in ll. 40 and 45 ; the medial long *ū* is indicated by a curve attached to the middle of the vertical on the left and tuned downwards as to appear as a subscript *t* ; see *pūga,* l. 7 ; the rare initial *ṛi* occurs in *Ṛishabha-,* l. 2, and the initial *ē* resembles a triangle with its vertical point below, as in *ēva-,* l. 21. Of the consonants, *k,* when the first member of a conjunct and when the *mātrā* of *ṛi* is attached to it, loses its loop, as in *kshaya-,* l. 5 and *-kṛichch-,* l. 6 ; the conjunct consonant *gg* occasionally appears as *gn* and *ṇṇ* as *nl,* for which see respectively *vinirgata,* l. 32 and *mārggaṇa,* l. 16, and *varṇṇana-,* l. 19 ; the lowest extremity of *ḍ* is not turned up as a tail ; see *ḍiṇḍīra-,* l. 13 ; *th* and *chh* as subscript are laid flat and appear almost alike ; cf., *e.g., prasthāna* and *nirgachchhad,* both in l. 14 ; *dh* is in a transitional stage, appearing both as with and without the horn on its left limb and also with or without the top-stroke, and occasionally the vertical of *dhā* is joined by a horizontal stroke ; see *prasādhita-,* l. 8, *-dhārā,* l. 16 and *Vōdha* and *gandha-,* both in l. 9, for all these examples. Occasionally it is difficult to distinguish between *t* and *n, ch, dh* and *v, m* and the palatal and the dental sibilants.

The language is Sanskrit, and except for the introductory obeisance, a portion in lines 54-58, and the date etc., in the end, the record is metrically composed throughout. It has 37 verses, which are not numbered.

As regards **orthography** we may note (1) the use of the sign for *v* to denote *b* as well, as in *vōdha for bōdha* in l. 9 ; (2) the occasional use of the dental for the palatal sibilant and *vice versa;* see *saśinau,* l. 37 and *śatasō-,* l. 45 ; (3) the reduplication of a consonant following *r* (with a few exceptions like *dharma-karma,* l. 49 ; (4) the use of the *pṛishṭha-mātrā ;* and (5) the general tendency to use an *anusvāra* in place of a nasal, except in a very few instances, as in *kālāntara,* l. 54, as opposed to *chaṁdra* in l. 6 and *gaṁdha,* l. 9. This remark does not apply to a nasal when it ends a verse or a hemistich.

In spite of the fact that the letters are well formed and carefully engraved and also that the language is generally correct, a few grammatical errors have crept in : they are *ujvala* for *ujjvala,* l. 13 ; *chchhaträ* for *chhatra,* l. 18 and *niḥparyāyaṁ* for *nishparyāyaṁ,* l. 28.

¹ The stone was removed to the Museum some time about 1916 A.C. See *Gwalior Arch. Rep.* for V.S. 1973, No. 46 which is in manuscript form.  
² Neither of the impressions alone is perfect for editing the record on its basis, but they supplement each other. And my transcript of the record, which was prepared from them both, was also revised from the original, subsequently.  
³ Cunningham’s *A.S.I.R.,* Vol. XX, pp. 99 ff. For Ḍubkuṇḍ, see *Ind. Atlas,* Quarter-Sheet 51 ; Long. 77º 5½’E., 25º 43½’ N., as mentioned by Kielhorn, in *Ep. Ind.,* Vol. II, p. 232. However, in the map of the C.I. Agency, published by the Survey of India Office, Calcutta, in 1886, the place is shown situated on the west bank of Parang (Pārā) which too is a tributary of the Chambal and flows about 15 kms. west of Kunu, almost parallel to it.
