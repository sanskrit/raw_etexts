¹ Vyāsa, whose complexion was dark.  
² The word *atāḍaka* here means (1) not a striker and (2) relieved of Tāḍakā; and Hari has the double meaning of (1) a horse and (2) a monkey.  
³ That following his brother’s intention Bhīma disguised himself as a cook at the time of *ajñāta-vāsa* is well known.  
⁴ The reference is to Arjuna who vanquished the army of Chitraratha.  
⁵ Here is an allusion to Karṇa (born of the Sun) who removed the pride of the enemies of Duryōdhana (strong in contest), who made an attempt to check the fame of the enemy Arjuna (check the white fame of the enemies) and who removed the misfortune of the supplicants.  
⁶ *Siṁhikā-bhū* is Rāhu (Saiṁhikēya) who causes an eclipse by devouring the Sun. The king is here described as overpowering the Sun in the form of his haughty adversaries and killing their elephants. For *aṅk-āgata-satva-vṛittiḥ,* cf. *Raghuvaṁśa,* II, 38.  
⁷ Heresr124.JPG is a play on the following words: *dāna* means (1) a gift and (2) ichor; *karavāla* means (1) a sword and (2) turn of the trunk of an elephant, *Dantapāli* is a kind of weapon.  
⁸ *Mitra* means (1) the sun and (2) a friend; and *jaḍa* means dull (the same as *jala,* meaning ‘water’).  
⁹ This verse mentions the actions of Vishṇu, Paraśurāma, Vāmana, Kṛishṇa and Nārāyaṇa, respectively. The word *jaḍa* is used here in its double meaning : (water) and (stupid), as above.
