**SUPPLEMENTARY INSCRIPTIONS**

No. 190 PLATE CLXVI  
**DHUBĒLĀ MUSEUM STONE INSCRIPTION OF THE TIME OF MADANAVARMAN**  
\[Vikrama\] Year 1203

THIS inscription was very briefly noticed by N. P. Chakravarti in the *Annual Report* of the Archaeological Survey of India, 1935-36, p. 94. As the stated therein, he found it “lying in the compound of the Dewan’s house at **Chhatarpur,** the principle town of a State of the same name and now the headquarters of a district in Madhya Pradesh. Some time subsequently, it was removed to the Museum at **Dhubēlā,** an adjoining village, where it is now exhibited.^(\[1\]) The record was edited by B.C. Jain, Deputy Director of Archaeology and Museum in Madhya Pradesh, in the *Journal* of the M.P. Historical Association, No. VI (1968), p. 44. The same scholar also favoured me with a rubbing, from which, and also from a photograph which I owe to the Chief Epigraphist, Archaeological Survey of India, the inscription is edited here.

The record is incised on the pedestal of a black stone status representing Śāntinātha, the sixteenth Jaina Tīrthaṅkara. The figure, which is in the *kāyōtsarga* posture, measures 150 cms. by 56 cms. The inscription consists of four lines of writing, measuring 28.5 cms. wide by 8 cms. high. It is in a perfect state of preservation. The writing shows slovenliness. The average size of the letters ranges between .8 and 1 cm.

The **alphabet** is Nāgarī. The letter *dh* has developed a horn on its left limb, as in *sādhu-,* l. 1 ; the *mātrā* of long *ū* is marked so as to appear a subscript *t,* as in pūrvva- in the same line ; and the form of ch is distinct from that of *v,* as in *cha* in l. 1, and *–varma* in line 4.

The **language is Sanskrit,** but the names in the last line are all without any case-ending. The record has two verses in the *Anushṭubh* metre, followed by a portion in prose, giving the date along with some other details. The **orthographical** peculiarities are that the consonant following r is reduplicated, as in *dharmma,* l. 1 ; the dental sibilant is put for the palatal except in one clear instance, *śrēshṭha* in l. 2 ; and the *pṛishṭha-mātrās* are occasionally used.

The inscription refers itself to the reign of the illustrious **Madanavarman,** whose dynasty and the royal titles are not mentioned in it, but he appears to be doubtless the homonymous king belonging to the **Chandēlla house of Jējākabhukti.** The **object** of the record is to show the installation of the statue of Jinōttama (Śāntinātha), by Lakshmīdhara, the son of Hariśchandra,^(\[2\]) whose predecessors are mentioned in it. The names are all without any historical interest. We are further told that the image was regularly worshipped by his successors.

The **date** is given in the last line, as **Saṁvat 1293, Phā** (Phālguna) **sudi**^(\[3\]) **9th Monday,** which corresponds to the **10th February, 1147 A.C.**^(\[4\]) It is an intermediate date for the reign of Madanavarman who is known to have occupied the Chandēlla throne from 1125 to 1163 A.C.

The inscription is sectarian and devoid of any historical interest. It does not mention any geographical name. It appears to have originally belonged to **Ajaygaḍh,** one of the strongholds of the Chandellas.

^(\[2\]) This conclusion is probable and not certain. The language of the inscription is faulty and it cannot dearly be made out as to who really installed the image.  
^(\[3\]) Chakravarti read *vadi,* but the first of these letters is clearly *su* in the photograph and also in the rubbing.  
^(\[4\]) On Monday, the ninth *tithi* commenced at .04 moment of the day, after mean sunrise. The year was Kārttikādi Vikrama, expired.
