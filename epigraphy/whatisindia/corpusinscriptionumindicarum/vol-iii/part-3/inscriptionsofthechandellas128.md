**KĀLANJAR ROCK INSCRIPTION OF THE TIME OF PARAMARDIDĒVA**

\[Vikrama\] Year 1240

THIS inscription was brought to notice by F. Kielhorn, who discussed its date, from a rubbing supplied to him by Burgess, in the *Indian Antiquary,* Vol. XIX, p. 37 (No. 67), and also included in his *List of Inscriptions of North India.*⁶ It is incised on a rock between the fourth and the fifth gate, locally known as Budh Budr (Būḍhī Bhadrā) and Hanumān *Darvāzā,* respectively, in the fort of **Kālañjar,** in the Narainī *Tehsīl* of the Bāndā District in Uttar Pradesh. It does not appear to have been noticed by Lieut. Maisey or General Cunningham who visited the place in the last century. It is edited here for the first time from an inked impression which I owe to the kindness of the Chief Epigraphist.

It is a short inscription consisting of 5 lines of writing, which covers a space 24∙5 cms. broad by 22 cms, high. The writing is well preserved except that it has lost two *aksharas* in the middle of l. 1, which, however, can be made out from the context. The height of the individual letters, excluding the top-*mātrās,* is about 3∙5 cms.

The **alphabet** is Nāgarī. The letter *dh* has developed a horn on its left limb, and *r* is denoted by a vertical with a stroke attached to its middle on the left, both these examples to be seen in *Yaśōdhara,* l. 3. The **language** is Sanskrit, which is generally correct ; and the record is in prose. The **orthography** calls for no special remarks.

The inscription refers itself to the victorious reign of the illustrious **Paramardidēva** ; and though nothing about his family or his titles is stated herein, from the provenance of the record  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
¹ The *rēpha* above this letter is cut as the curve of the medial *ī.*  
² The *akshara* in the brackets was originally engraved as *pa.*  
³ Better read ![](ns604.JPG). In *kē* that follows the sign of the *pṛishṭha-mātrā* is separated from the letter, as some others in this inscription.  
⁴ *Pushpāṇi* or *puṇyāni* is intended.  
⁵ Both these *daṇḍas* are endowed with a top-stroke with which they are joined to the preceding letter.  
⁶ See *Ep. Ind.,* Vol. V. *appx.,* p. 37, No. 178. It is No. 400 of Bhandarkar’s *List of Inscriptions.*
