**INSCRIPTIONS OF THE CHANDELLAS OF JEJAKABHUKTI**

villages are now included in the Khurai *tehsīl* of the Sāgar District, which is separated by the Vetravatī from the Vidishā District. If this identification is correct, it also appears almost certain that the Sūḍali *vishava,* in which these places are said to have been then included, denoted the region lying to the east of the river and more or less comprising the modern *tehsīl* of Khurai (now in the Sāgar District).

^(\[1\]) From facsimile accompanying Kielhorn’s article in *Ind. Ant.,* Vol. XVI.  
^(\[2\]) Denoted by a symbol.  
^(\[3\]) The superscript of this letter is so formed as to appear a combination of the palatal and the dental sibilant, and in the subscript of the same letter that follows, it is shown by a serif.  
^(\[4\]) The sign of punctuation is superfluous and the name that follows can also be read as ![](jen2.JPG).

^(\[5\]) The consonant of the last *akshara* of the name appears to have been changed subsequently. Looking to other instances in the record we cannot be certain whether it is *ḍ or d.*  
^(\[6\]) The whole *akshara* is struck out but it cannot be *dhō* as conjectured by Kielhorn. For ![](jen3.JPG), see n. above, ![](jen4.JPG) means ‘belonging to’.  
^(\[7\]) The consonant of this *akshara* can also be read as ![](jen5.JPG).  
^(\[8\]) It literally means a pillar (marking the boundary).  
^(\[9\])This expression, which is an example of *madhyama-padalōpī samāsa* means ‘an ant-hill by a *madhūka* tree’.  
^(\[10\]) The first *akshara* of this expression looks the archaic *ta.*  
^(\[11\]) The punctuation-marks are unnecessary, as some others in this and the following lines. They are not marked here. The same we find in the Sēmrā grant, below, No. 126.  
^(\[12\]) The syllable in brackets also looks like ḍha but it seems to be intended for ṭa, which is all the more certain from a comparison of it in the name Sūḍha in l. 19, below, which is so read in the light of the next inscription. Ṭakārī (and not Ḍhakārī) appears as a famous place in some other plates also.
