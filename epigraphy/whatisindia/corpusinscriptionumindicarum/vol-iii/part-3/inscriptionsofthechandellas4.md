**INSCRIPTIONS OF THE CHANDELLAS OF JEJAKABHUKTI**

Kielhorn in the *Epigraphia Indica,* Vol. I (1888-1892), pp. 122 ff., with text is the Nāgarī, from, impressions supplied to him by Burgess, with is translation (pp. 130 ff.) and a photolithograph facing p. 216 ; and some of its historical importance was later on discussed by scholars from time to time.^(\[1\]) It is edited here from an excellent inked impression which I owe to the kindness of the Chief Epigraphist, Archaeological Survey of India.^(\[2\])

As stated above, the record is engraved on a large slab. The inscribed surface measures 1∙72 metres broad by 0∙74 metres high and consists o twenty-eight lines of writing. The stone has suffered considerably about the middle of lines 17-21, and in the latter half of the last lines and some others *aksharas* here and there have been damaged or rendered illegible by the effects of weather; moreover, a few of the *aksharas* which were wholly or partially visible in Kielhorn’s time have now been completely broken away. However, in most of the cases the missing *aksharas* can be supplied by conjecture, in view of the context and occasionally from the lithograph published in the *Epigraphia Indica,* referred to above, from which too I have compared my reading of the text. The letters are well formed and carefully engraved. Their size varies from 1∙9 to 2∙2 cms.

 The **characters** are of the Nāgarī alphabet. To make some general observations, we find that the top-strokes are occasionally angular, *e.g., of dānava,* l. 1, the vertical strokes of the letters generally end in a curve and the *daṇḍas* are often marked as the modern Nāgarī *ra.* The initial a and the consonants *t, n, v* and *s* show transitional forms; see, *e.g.,* a in *ākalpa-,* l. 3, and *āsthāna-,* l. 23; *t* in –*avatu* and *vikrānta-,* both in l. 1 : *n* in *dānava,* l. 1, and *–ajani,* l. 3, and *s* in *yasya-* and *sānu-,* both in l. 8. The initial *i,* which appears in ll. 4 and 26, is formed of two dots horizontally placed and subscribed by a loop ending in a tail ; and the initial *ē, e.g., in ēk = aiv-,* l. 20, has its left curve joined to the right vertical, which has a tail below. The loop of *k* as the first member of a conjunct consonant or in letters like *ku* and *kṛi* gives place to a stroke or is joined to the vertical not directly but by a stroke; cf., *e.g., kshaya-, kṛita and krīḍa-,* all in l. 6, *kula-* in l. 12, and *chakrē* and *kṛitī,* both in l. 26. The letter *ṅ* has not developed the dot, *e.g.,* in *saṅga,* l. 2; the lingual *ṇ* is laid flat when a subscript ; see *vitīrṇṇa-,* l. 2 ; the rare *jh* appears twice, in *nirjjhara* and *jhātkāra,* both in l. 8 ; and *ph* in *phala-* in l. 6. *Dh* is in a transitional stage, showing its left limb resembling v in most cases, but occasionally this limb appears developed and is very rarely horned, though this horn is not joined to the lower part or the vertical ; cf, respectively, *dhāttri, dhīr- and –mvudha-,* all in l. 3. R which has assumed the modern form as in *tārā-,* l. 2, is sometimes engraved in a slightly varying way, *e.g.,* in *kirāta, ramya* and *vāri,* all in l. 8. The subscript form of this letter is denoted by a serif attached to the lowest extremity of the vertical, as in *prasava-,* l. 3. This form is occasionally indistinguishable from the curved end of the verticals with appear throughout the inscription, as stated above, or from the stroke for the medial short *u,* which sometimes shows this form ; see, *e.g., -asura-, vara- and ttrīn,* all in l. 1.

 In spite of the carefulness devoted to the record by the mason in its technical execution, we observe that in some cases it is difficult to distinguish between *t* and *v,* as in *tanu-,* l. 1, between *p* and *y* as in *pātu* and *paya-,* both in l. 2, between *bh* and *h,* as in *–bhṛiti* and *bhīma* in ll. 2 and 10, respectively. As for the mātrās, a peculiar example of the medical *ā* is to be seen crescent-shaped in *kaṭāksha-chchhaṭā-* in l. 2, and a rare instance of the medial *ō* is in *trilōka-,* l. 1, where the *pṛishṭha-mātrā* assumes the form of a dot attached to the left of the top-stroke of *l.* The secondary short *u* appears both in its ordinary form as in *avatu,* l. 1, and as a serif as of the subscript *r,* as in *bhuvana-* in the same line. And finally, the formation of the last *akshara trē* is noteworthy.

 The **language** is Sanskrit, generally correct ; and with the exception of a short sentence paying obeisance to Vāsudēva in the beginning and the date and some other particulars in the last line, the record is all metrically composed. The style is ornate and the composition abounds in figures of speech like *anuprāsa, upamā, rūpaka, vyatirēka* and the rare *parisaṅkhyā* (v. 25). The language is fluent ; but one of the verses (No. 4) does not admit of proper construction, as shown in a note appended to the text. The total number of verses is forty-nine ; they are not numbered.

 As regards **orthography** we notice that (1) the sign for v is everywhere employed to denote *b ; see vrahma,* l. 2 ; (2) the dental sibilant is occasionally written for the palatal as in *Kasmīra,* l. 13, while the reverse is also found *e.g., in Kailāśa* in l. 24 ; but such cases are very few ; (3) the
