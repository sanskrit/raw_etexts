**INSCRIPTIONS OF THE CHANDELLAS OF JEJAKABHUKTI**

**SĀGAR COPPER-PLATE INSCRIPTION OF TRAILŌKYAVARMAN**

was camped when the Garrā grants were made. On the strength of this we may also assume that in 1208 he had rather advanced further in the north. Of the **Geographical** names occurring in the record. Ṭiharī, the place of the king’s residence when he issued the grant (l. 10), has been identified with the same village and also known by its longer name Ṭehri-Bāṇapur, near Ṭīkamgaḍh, the chief town of district in Madhya Pradesh. **Maṇḍāüra** or Maḍaura, the gift-village (l. 7) has been identified with the modern Madaora in the Lalitpur sub-division of the Jhānsī District and lying about 45 kms. south of Ṭīkamgaḍh; and Ṭehrī is at almost the same distance to the south-east of Lalitpur. **Sihaḍōuṇi** (l. 7) is, of course, identical with Siyāḍōṇi of the inscriptions and has been taken identical with Sirōn *Khurd,* situated about 15 kms. west-northwest of Lalitpur. And lastly, **Vaḍavāri** (l. 7) is obviously the same as Vaḍavāḍa of the Garrā plate (No. l) and is also mentioned in the Sēmrā grant of Paramardin. There is no sufficient data in the inscription to identify **Raikōura,** the original place of the donee, mentioned in l. 12.

¹ From impressions.  
² Expressed by symbol, which is more probably for *Siddham.*  
³ The vertical of the consonant *v* is not completely cut and it appears as *d.* A faint trace above the topstroke indicates that the sign for the *mātrā* was incised very lightly and it could not come in the impressions.  
⁴ A redundant stroke makes the subscript of ![](nitro151.JPG) appear as *bh.*  
⁵ Both these names appear as carved after rubbing out some other *aksharas* engraved originally. The first of the names may also be read as ![](nitro152.JPG). The *anusvāra* on *ma* of the name that follows is doubtful.  
⁶ A redundant horizontal stroke appears between this letter and the *mātrā,* as in some other places also.  
⁷ Katare read the letter as *da,* but it is mutilated and the *pṛishṭhamātrā* appears partially.  
⁸ The *akshara* pa is not fully cut, as also in some other lines below.  
⁹ The name can be read also as *Raukōra.*  
¹⁰ The *daṇḍas* in this and the preceding lines are redundant.
