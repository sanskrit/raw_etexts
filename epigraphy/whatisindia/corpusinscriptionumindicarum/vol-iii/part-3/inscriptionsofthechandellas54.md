\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
^(\[1\]) Some other letters originally cut in place of nmū- and dru, which were subsequently corrected.  
^(\[2\]) The *akshara* in the brackets was lost in Kielhorn’s time also, and the reading adopted here is as proposed by him.  
^(\[3\]) Read ![](god1.JPG). The consonant of the second of these aksharas is damaged.  
^(\[4\]) The bracketed *akshara* is entirely lost.  
^(\[5\]) Kielhorn read *-śitaṁ* and corrected the first of these letters to si, to give the sense of āsitaṁ. But my impression shows a *rēpha* attached to *ś* and thus I take the letter as *Śra.*  
^(\[6\]) The preceding letter was originally cut as ![](god2.JPG) and later on altered to ![](god3.JPG). This verse contains a play on vṛitta meaning (1) round and (2) conduct, and on guṇa meaning (1) thread and (2) merit.  
^(\[7\]) The *visarga* is omitted here not wrongly, as Kielhorn has observed, but in accordance with the *Vārttika* on Pāṇini, VIII, 3, 36.  
^(\[8\]) This refers to the legend according to which Bhīshma was born from the Ganges *(Tridaśa-sarit)* by Sāntanu. See Mbh., I, 99. 47; Mēdinī, 118, 81 (Gāṅgēyaḥ Syāt Pumān Bhīshmē).  
^(\[9\]) The bracketed akshara appears to have been changed to sa, which suits the sense.  
^(\[10\]) There is a pun here on the word pala, meaning (1) flesh and (2) a weight (and thus a coin of that weight). Śivi is the well-known mythical king.  
^(\[11\]) Kielhorn read this akshara as ti and corrected it to ni, but I do not think that the emendation proposed by him is necessary. Rājati is in the loc. absolute; the verb is ubhayapadī.  
^(\[12\]) Read ![](god4.JPG). The latter ha, which was repeated by mistake, has been scored off; but I fail to find the two signs of the anusvāra also struck off, as Kielhorn observed.  
^(\[13\]) The pṛishṭha-mātrā of ![](god5.JPG) is very thin and the consonant of ![](god6.JPG) in appears to have been corrected. The letter ![](god6.JPG) is damaged by the crack.
