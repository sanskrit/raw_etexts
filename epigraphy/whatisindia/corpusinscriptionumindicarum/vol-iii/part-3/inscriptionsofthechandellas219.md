No. 157 ; PLATE CXXXXIV

**NARWAR COPPER-PLATE INSCRIPTION OF VĪRASIṀHADĒVA**

\[Vikrama\] Year 1177

THIS inscription was transcribed and translated by Fitz Edward Hall, without a facsimile in the *Journal of the American Oriental Society,* Vol. VI (1858-60), pp. 542 ff., where he also states that “a negative facsimile” of it “has been lithographed in the *Journal* of the Archaeological Society of Delhi, for January, 1853.” Nothing is now known about the journal mentioned by Hall ; and in his writing he did not state anything as to how, when and where the plate was actually found. The present whereabouts thereof are also unknown, and as even an impression too of it is not now forthcoming, I have copied here Hall’s transcript and added my notes to it.

¹ Read ![](sr134.JPG) There may originally have been the *rēpha* on the following *akshara.*  
² A *kāka-pada* sign is engraved at the end of this line. This quarter also shows a wrong pause-fall.  
³ Here, as often elsewhere,![](sr135.JPG) is engraved as ![](sr136.JPG)  
⁴ The word *pūrvā* means a *praśasti* ; and while editing this inscription, Hultzsch failed to see this when he remarks that “the word *praśasti* has to be supplied with *pūrvāṁ” (Ind. Ant.,* Vol. XV, p. 202, *n.*).  
⁵ There is no punctuation mark to close the inscription.
