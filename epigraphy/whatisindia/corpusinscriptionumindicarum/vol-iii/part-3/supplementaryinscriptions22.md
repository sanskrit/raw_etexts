**SUPPLEMENTARY INSCRIPTIONS**

Kṛishṇarāja and his successors, viz., his son Kākala and grandson Vikramasiṁha. Thus a struggle for the throne appears to have been going on for two or three generations from the time of Kṛishṇarāja to that of his grandson Vikramasiṁha, roughly from about 1060 to 1115 A.C., and during this period Rāmadēva, who is described as fierce in battle *(raṇ-ōtkaṭa)* in our No. 76 (v. 7), may have occupied the throne at least for some time. If this suggestion is accepted, we may conclude that it is perhaps owing to the confusion caused by this struggle that the mention of the name of the reigning king may have been avoided by the composer of the inscription.

^(\[1\]) From the original and an impression.  
^(\[2\]) Expressed by a symbol.  
^(\[3\]) The first of the *daṇḍas* is so close to the preceding *akshara* as to look like a *mātrā,* and the second appears to have been inserted subsequently.  
^(\[4\])*rēpha* on the first of the bracketed *aksharas* is faint even on the original. The idea of the water of the Ganges flowing out of the *kamaṇḍalu* recalls that in *N.S.C.,* Canto I, v. 48.  
^(\[5\]) The slanting stroke of the subscript of the bracketed *akshara* is faintly visible even on the original.  
^(\[6\]) The sign of *anusvāra* on the penultimate letter is blurred. The meaning of the word *pattikā* is not known to me. Though not known to lexicons, from context it appears to denote a territorial division.  
^(\[7\]) The construction in this verse is not proper, but it shows that in that region *araghaṭṭas* (water-wheels) were used for irrigating fields. The word *śētī (khētī* ?) is local, meaning cultivation, from kshētra (?). According to M. Willams, *sētakī is nady-ādi.*  
^(\[8\]) The subscript letter of the second *akshara* is cut as *y,* ending in a stroke as of ph. The preceding sentence is in the local language and I am unable to understand it. The sense shows that *nechaka* is a local word meaning a garden.  
^(\[9\]) The reading is certain. It probably means those who observe fast for a month.  
^(\[10\]) *Pala* is a weight equal to four *karshas.*  
^(\[11\]) The word *karsha* appears also in No. 84, v. 76. The expression that follows has to be corrected to -(Sanskrit).
