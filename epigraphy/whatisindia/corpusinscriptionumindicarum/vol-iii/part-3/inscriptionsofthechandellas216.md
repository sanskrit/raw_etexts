**INSCRIPTIONS OF THE CHANDELLAS OF JEJAKABHUKTI**

**GWĀLIOR STONE INSCRIPTION OF THE TIME OF MAHĪPĀLA**

in a good state of preservation and indicates that the letters were beautifully formed and carefully engraved. Their average size with the *mātrās* is between l.2 and l.5 cms.

The **characters** are Nāgarī of the beginning of the twelfth century A.C. and show a sort of affinity with those of the preceding inscription which too is from the same place ; but some of the forms of letters of the present inscription are rather archaic. To note some of their peculiarities, we find that g and *ṭh,* when subscripts of a conjunct consonant, lose their vertical ; see respectively, *-aṅga,* l. 1 and *kaṇṭha-* and *adhishṭhāya,* both in l. 2, but there are exceptions, *e.g.,* the *akshara* g retains its vertical in *–aṅgināṁ-,* l. 5. *Th* is represented by two hollow circles placed vertically and sometimes assuming the form of the modern *sh,* as in *patha* and *Manōratha,* both in l. 4. The letter *ṇṇ* appears as *ṇl,* for which see *–arṇṇava-,* l. 5. *N* is by mistake often engraved as *t* ; cf. *Manōratha* and *vipināṁvu,* both in l. 4. The slightly different varieties of the form of *r,* as noted while editing the preceding inscription, may be illustrated in *dharitrīṁ,* l. 2, where the letter shows a wedge, in *kurutē,* l. 3, where a horizontal stroke is attached to the left of the vertical, and in *kshatriya,* l. 2, where it appears almost as modern. This very letter, when the latter member of a conjunct consonant, is sometimes complete with the preceding letter half-drawn, as in *kshatriya,* and is sometimes shown by a serif, as in *pratāpa,* both these words to be found in l. 2.

The **language** is Sanskrit ; and with the exception of the concluding portion containing the date, the record in its preserved portion is composed in verses. In all there are 24 stanzas, composed in different metres ; and the rare metres like *Bhujaṅgaprayāta* and *Pṛithvī,* and *Atitōṭaka,* which is still seldom to be seen, have been used, showing the poet’s skill in versification. The verses are not numbered, but are marked in the end by two vertical strokes and their first halves are marked by one vertical stroke, as usual.

With respect to **orthography,** we notice (1) the use of the sign of *v* to denote *b* as well, *e.g.,* in *vabhau,* l. 2 ; (2) reduplication of a consonant following *r*, as in *vārttā,* l. 3 ; (3) the use of the dental sibilant in place of the palatal to be found only five times in the extant portion of the record, *viz.,* in *–asmavēsma,* l. 5, *visadī-,* l. 6, and *śasvat,* occurring twice in l. 7 ; (4) the sporadic use of the *pṛishṭha-* and the *ūrdhva-mātrās* ; (5) the tendency to use a *para-savarṇa* more often than an *anusvāra* ; (6) the use of *h* for *gh* in *aṅghri,* l. 2 ; and (7) the marking of final consonants regularly, including *m,* which is rightly used at the end of a word, excepting only two instances showing its wrong use by its change to an *anusvāra* at the end of both the hemistiches in verse 21.

The **object** of the inscription is to record the construction of a temple dedicated to Hara (Śiva), by Āśāchandra, who is said to have been a younger brother of Madhusūdana, a son of Māṇichandra and a grandson of Manōratha of the Māthura Kāyastha clan, who was in charge of recording the income and expenditure of king Bhuvanapāla. The **date** of the *pratishṭhā* of the temple when the *liṅga* was set up in it, is recorded in words in the last line ; it was **the sixth day of the bright half of the month of Māgha when eleven hundred and sixty-one years had elapsed from the time of the king Vikrama.** The date cannot be verified ; but taking the year to be the Chaitrādi Vikrama expired *(atīta),* it corresponds to **Tuesday, 5th January, 1104 A.C.,** when the *tithi* ended ar ∙45 after mean sunrise, and for the Kārttikādi, to Monday, 23rd January, 1105 A.C., when the *tithi* ended at ∙55 after mean sunrise.

As stated above, the inscription is fragmentary. Its contents, as can be known from the extant portion thereof, may now be reviewed briefly. The first stanza, of which only the third quarter is preserved, introduces a king of the name of **Bhuvanapāla,** and the second, which too is fragmentary, mentions his son whose name is unfortunately lost.¹ Stanza 3 is rather better preserved ; it gives the name of **Padmapāla** and states that he was a grandson of Bhuvanapāla and a son of **Dēvapāla,** thus supplying the name which has been lost in the second stanza.² This

¹ The beginning too may have contained a sentence in prose paying obeisance to Śiva ; this portion too is now lost.  
² Verse 2 has the reading *“aparājitaḥ”* at the end of the hemistiches ; and, as observed by D. R. Bhandarkar, it is possible to take Aparājita as an elder brother of Dēvapāla, or, as the Yamaka shows a *biruda* of Dēvapāla himself, whose name occurs in stanza 3. See his *List of Inscriptions,* No. 169, *n.* Bhuvanapāla is the same as Mūladēva of the preceding record, as said in its verse 12.
