No. 112 ; PLATE CIV

AJAYAGAḌH ROCK INSCRIPTION OF THE TIME OF KĪRTTIVARMAN

(Undated)

THIS inscription was found by Alexander Cunningham in the touring season of 1883-84 and was noticed by him in his *Archaeological Survey of India Reports, Volume* XXI, p. 54 (Pl.), where he says that the inscription consists of four lines and contains the name of Kīrttivarman in the last line. The record was again noticed by N. P. Chakravarti in the *Annual Report* of the Archaeological Survey of India, for the year 1935-36, p. 92; and from an ink-impression applied by the Government Epigraphist for India, it was edited by Dr. Sant Lal Katare, in the *Epigraphia Indica,* Volume XXX, pp. 87 ff., with the text in Nāgarī and Plate (facing p. 90). From the same plate the subjoined transcript is prepared.

The inscription is engraved above a group of female images on a rock lying below the upper gate of the fort of **Ajayagaḍh,** situated by the side of the chief town of a *parganā* of the  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
¹ Originally incised as ![](lesus2.JPG) and later on the curve above the top-stroke was attempted to alter so as to form a *mātrā.*  
*2* Kielhorn remarked that the superscript of *rbhū* was omitted while engraving, but in the impression before me it is very clear. This verse has a pun on the word *agada* meaning (1) free from disease and (2) without the *gadā,* mace.  
³ Kielhorn read the bracketed letter as d![](lesus3.JPG) and corrected it to![](lesus4.JPG).  
⁴ Above this letter is a fault of the stone appearing as an *anusvāra* sign.  
⁵ Both the bracketed *aksharas* are rather peculiar ; the fore-part of the first was probably formed as the of *y* and subsequently corrected, and the second appearing as ![](lesus5.JPG). In the following ![](lesus6.JPG)-, *n* appears as *t.*  
⁶ The subscript of ![](lesus7.JPG) appears more like ![](lesus8.JPG).  
⁷ This *akshara* looks somewhat like ![](lesus9.JPG) but it is as I have taken it here.  
⁸ The fourth *pāda* of this verse obstructs against the metre *ślōka,* though it is a different type of *anushṭubh.* ⁹ Kielhorn says that the subscript is formed as o but in the impression before me it is clearly the same as taken here.  
¹⁰ This *akshara* is a combination of the palatal and the dental sibilants.  
¹¹ The vowel attached to the bracketed letter is clearly u and the consonant of the following letter, though indistinct and cramped, is *ś,* marking the whole *akshara* to be *śu* and not *ba,* as it was read by Hultzsch in *Ind. Ant.,* Vol. XI, p. 311. And thus I agree with Kielhorn who  
observes that perhaps this letter ![](lesus10.JPG) was at first omitted and was inserted on revision and this is why it appears as a *visarga* in Cunningham’s  
photozincograph. In the impression the two circles, as of *ś* (and not v) are clear.  
¹² The tail of ![](lesus11.JPG) is curved to the left.
