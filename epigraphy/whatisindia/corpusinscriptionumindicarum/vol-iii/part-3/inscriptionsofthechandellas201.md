**INSCRIPTIONS OF THE CHANDELLAS OF JEJAKABHUKTI**

¹ *Sandhi* is not made here. The reading of the five *aksharas* following the name is clear; they were read by Kielhorn as *praka\[ṭākshata\],* but they give no suitable sense.  
² Only the *mātrā* of this *akshara* now survives. Similarly the first two *aksharas* of the next line have also peeled off completely and they have been restored here from Kielhorn’s reading. This shows that the stone was in a better condition when Cunningham took the impression.  
³ This is *yābhyāṁ,* which would not suit the metre. The first and the third letters are not distinct.  
⁴ The consonant of the bracketed *akshara* has now peeled off.  
⁵ *Sandhi* is now made here.
