^(\[1\]) Here too the reading is from the traces left.  
^(\[2\]) The sign of *visarga* is almost mingled with the letter that follows.  
^(\[3\]) This *akshara* appears as ![](sn36.JPG).  
^(\[4\]) Most of the *aksharas* in the latter half of this verse have now disappeared, leaving only traces.  
^(\[5\]) The reading of bracketed letters at both the places in this half of this verse is uncertain ; and according to Dr. Sircar, they are Hastināpura and Vīsvala, respectively. Sircar also suggested that the latter denotes the Chāhamāna king Vigraharāja IV, whose known dates are 1153 and 1164 A.C. ; and since Vijayadēva’s grandson, the hero of the present record, was a later contemporary of the Imperial Chāhmāna king of Ajmer and Delhi, and probably also an officer under the Gāhaḍavāla monarch Vijayachandra (c. 1255-70 A.C.), who is reported to have come into conflict with the king of Delhi, his grandfather (Vijayadēva) may be taken to have been a minister under Āsalla, son of Nṛivarman, who also defeated Vīravarman, in battle with Gōpāla and thus he continued for two generations. For this suggestion of Sircar, see Ep. Ind., Vol. XXXIII, p. 37. But this is merely a conjecture, unsupported by any other evidence and also involving a number of probabilities, besides that it is based on the uncertain reading of both the names, *viz.,* Hastināpura and Vīsvala, which may also be read as *Vimvala.*  
^(\[6\]) Engraved ![](sn37.JPG), subsequently changed to ![](sn38.JPG), with the mark of the *mātrā* still visible.  
^(\[7\]) The upper curve of the *mātrā* of the preceding letter is extremely faint on the original.  
^(\[8\]) Sircar read ![](sn39.JPG).
