No. 113 ; PLATE CV

FRAGMENTARY MAHŌBĀ INSCRIPTION ENDING WITH THE NAME OF KĪRTTIVARMAN

(Date lost ?)

THIS inscription was discovered by General Cunningham in 1865, at **Mahōbā,**¹⁰ the ancient *Mahōtsavanagara* and the chief town of a *Parganā* of the same name in the Hamīrpur District of Uttar Pradesh. The place lies 86 kilometres to the south of Hamīrpur and 55 kilometres to the north of Khajurāhō, and is connected with both these places by metalled roads and is also a railway station on the Jhānsī-Mānikpur branch of the Central Railway. Cunningham found the stone let into the wall of a *Dargāh* known as of Pīr Muhammad Shāh ; but some time later it found its way to the Museum at Allahabad, where Cunningham saw it again in 1872, and from an impression thereof taken by him there, he published a short account of it in his *Annual Report* of the *Archaeological Survey of India* for 1883-1884, Volume XXI, p. 71, and facsimile (Plate xxi). In 1885 a transcript of the inscription with a short abstract thereof in German was published in *Zeitschrift d. Deutsch. Morg. Ges,* Volume XL, p. 47, by E. Hultzsch, who also edited it almost about the same time in the *Epigraphia Indica,* Volume I (1888), pp. 217 ff. It is edited here from the original and a fresh impression kindly supplied by the Director of the Provincial Museum, Lucknow, where the stone is now exhibited.

¹ ![](V2.png) is probably dropped by the writer in view of the preceding *mātrā* and not knowing that the *sandhi* would be wrong since the *visarga* has already been dropped here.  
² The *mātrā* of *ō* is partly visible above this letter.  
³ There is a *kāka-pada* sign at the end of this line.  
⁴ cf. ![](V3.png) in *Raghuvaṁśa,* Canto II, v. 47.  
⁵ Katare read ![](V4.png). But what he takes to be a *pṛishṭha-mātrā* is in fact intended to be a *daṇḍa* which is very closely engraved before this syllable.  
⁶ A redundant stroke makes this letter appear as ![](V5.png). *cf. Pīta-śaila-vishayēshu,* below, in No. 150, v. 9, and *Pita-parvata-talē,* in C. I. I.,  
Vol. IV. p. 280, and text, v. 10. In the former, it is called a *vishaya.*  
⁷ The reading of ![](V6.png) is doubtful, as a horizontal stroke appears between the two limbs of this letter.  
⁸ This means either (1) authority over the main gate of the fort ![](V7.png) or the supreme authority over (all the) gates ![](V8.png) of the fort.  
⁹ Dr. Katare observes that the inscription ends abruptly and also that the scribe apparently left out the last two letters ![](V9.png) which have to be  
conjecturally restored. But what appears to me is that these two letters may have been scribed just below the last two letters of the  
line, since there appears an *anusvāra* and a horizontal stroke in the Pl.  
¹⁰ Mahōbā is one of the well-known strongholds of the Chandēlla rulers; it is situated in Long, 79º.53’ E.; Lat. 25º, 18’ N. The place and its  
antiquities are described by Cunningham in *A. S. I., A. R.,* Vol. XXI. pp. 71 ff. For the discovery of the inscription, see *ibid.,* Vol. II, p. 447.
