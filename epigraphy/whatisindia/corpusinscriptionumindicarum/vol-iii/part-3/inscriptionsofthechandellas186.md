¹ From an impression.  
² Denoted by a symbol.  
³ The vowel-sign of the bracketed letter is indistinct and the expression has to be taken in the sense of *vidhṛita-Kēdāra-rūpaya,* as already remarked by Kielhorn who gives the parallel example of *dēhabaddha.*  
⁴ This expression, which grammatically cannot be defended, is used for metrical exigencies, and *tiḥ* is not changed to *tēḥ* in the original, as supposed by Kielhorn. This appellation is better known by its modern name Chhattīsgaḍh which signifies (the region or country of) thirty-six forts but not cities, as Kielhorn also remarked. But though the word *gaḍh* primarily means a fort, in its secondary sense it may be taken to denote a town which was thus fortified. The word *karaṇa* that follows is used to denote the occupation of a Kāyastha. It also means a document, for which see *C. I. I.,* IV, p. 150, l. 35.  
⁵ In many cases in the record the sign for *b* and *v,* though separate, are not distinguishable. Also see *tirōbabhūva* in v. 27, below.  
⁶ The *anusvāra,* about which Kielhorn was doubtful, is clear in the impression before me, though indistinct in the Plate.  
⁷ A *kāka-pada* sign is engraved here. The fourteen *vidyās* referred to here are the four *Vēdas,* the six Vēdāṅgas, the Mīmāṁsā Nyāya, Dharmaśāstra and the Purāṇas.  
⁸ The word *dharma* has to be taken here to denote a title or a distinguishing feature.  
⁹ Originally *ārādhya* and later on the sign of the *mātrā* put above the second letter. The word *tāmraka* is used here in the sense of *tāmra-paṭṭa,* a royal grant, authorising him to enjoy the village. Cf. *śāsana* in v. 6 of No. 112, above.  
¹⁰ Originally ![](rd20.JPG)with the superfluous *ma* struck off later on. Niśi- is wrongly put here for *niśā-* which would not suit the metre, as also![](rd21.JPG) lengthened in the fourth foot.  
¹¹ Originally samētām, with the *mātrā* of tā scored off later on.  
¹² Originally ![](rd22.JPG), which is later on corrected. This one and the preceding two errors have also been noted by Kielhorn. Also read *niyukta* in  
place of *yukta.*  
¹³ The reading of *sa* is certain, but the metre requires this letter to be long, *e.g., nityaṁ* which also gives the same sense.
