¹ The correct Sanskrit form of this name is Bhuvanapāla.  
² The horizontal stroke of the second *akshara* is missing, marking it appear as *rā.* ³ This *daṇḍa* is rather attached to the following letter and appears as a *pṛishṭha-mātrā.* The preceding sign of *anusvāra,* as some others below, is so faintly marked as to be visible only on the plate.  
⁴ The *daṇḍas* are redundant. For ![](ns301.JPG) that follows, kielhorn suggested .![](ns302.JPG)  
⁵ This *akshara* in brackets is engraved as *tā.* Drop *Rāja* at the beginning of this line.  
⁶ The consonant of this *akshara* is engraved as g with the horizontal stroke missing.  
⁷ The curve above is omitted in the process of engraving.  
⁸ The superscript *r* is lightly engraved and the medial *ē* sign is detached so as to look like a *daṇḍa.* ⁹ Read *bhavadbhiḥ* followed by a *daṇḍa,* and then *iti.*  
¹⁰ Read ![](ns303.JPG) as in No. 119, l. 41.  
¹¹ Here again the upper curve of *khi* is missing.  
¹² This *akshara* is disfigured by some redundant strokes.  
¹³ The subscript *dh* is only partly engraved and looks like *r* with double strokes, as in *grāmaḥ* in l. 10.
