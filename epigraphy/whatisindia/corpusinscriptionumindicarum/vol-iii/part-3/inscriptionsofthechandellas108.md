**INSCRIPTIONS OF THE CHANDELLAS OF JEJAKABHUKTI**

About the exact location of **Naugāva,** the **origin**nal place of the donee (l. 16), we can hardly be certain for want of details. However, it may be noted here that one Navagāmva is mentioned in the Māndhātā grant of the Paramāra king Jayavarman II, of V.S. 1317, but there the name appears with the word *sthāna* applied to it.¹ whereas in the present grant it is mentioned as a *bhaṭṭāgrahāra.*

TEXT²

Metres : Verses 1-4 Anushṭubh ; v. 5 Śālinī.

**First Plate**

¹ See No. 60, text, l. 31, and my remarks about the location of the place mentioned in it.  
² From a set of estampages supplied by the Director. Provincial Museum, Lucknow. After my writing on the record was completed, I have also compared my transcript of this inscription from the original plates in the Provincial Museum, Lucknow, for which I am thankful to its Curator Shri V. N. Shrivastava, for placing them at my disposal and giving me all facilities for my work there.  
³ Denoted by a variant of the symbol.  
⁴ The upper stroke of *th* in *pṛithvī* is not engraved.  
⁵ A superfluous stroke makes this *akshara* look like *thō.*  
⁶ The *ē* resembles *pa* and the lower extremity of the vertical of the following letter is joined to that of its fore-limb.  
⁷ The vertical stroke showing the *mātrā* is detached from the letter so as to look like a *daṇḍa.* Below are some other instances of the type, which are not noted every time.  
⁸ The *daṇḍa* is superfluous.  
⁹ Read *cha* followed by a *daṇḍa* and then *astu.*  
¹⁰ Both these *aksharas* are mutilated and the first of them appears more like *sā* than *śā.* It may also be noted here that the third *pravaras* of this *gōtra* is *Śyāvāśva.* Read![](ns201.JPG). By wrong strokes of the chisel, *rchchya* appears as *rdha* and *va* in *pravarāya* as *tra. Vā* in *–sāvāsa-* also appears to have been tampered.
