^(\[1\]) The*daṇḍa,* is redundant.  
^(\[2\]) A flowery design is carved between the double *daṇḍas,* as intended to separate the second part of the inscription.  
^(\[3\]) Read ![](srs9.JPG), but it would be metrically defective. Better ![](srs10.JPG).  
^(\[4\]) Read ![](srs11.JPG):, or better, ![](srs12.JPG):.  
^(\[5\]) The *pāda* contains seven (and not eight) syllables.  
^(\[6\]) Read ![](srs13.JPG), for the sake of metre.  
^(\[7\]) These two letters are illegible. They may be conjecturally restored as ![](srs14.JPG):.  
^(\[8\]) The portion in the brackets is now lost and has been restored here from Chakravarti’s reading. He also observed that some portion after ![](srs15.JPG) was probably left owing to its damaged condition.
