¹ The bracketed *akshara* was originally omitted and was later on written below the line, with a mark above, to draw attention.  
² The *daṇḍa* is redundant or, it may have been a *kāka-pada* sign.  
³ The *mātrā* of the preceding *akshara* has partially come out.  
⁴ The sign of *anusvāra* is struck off on the original.  
⁵ The *daṇḍa* appears to have been inserted subsequently.  
⁶ ![](kp3.JPG) is clear on the original. Kielhorn read it as *nya.*  
⁷ Taking the preceding *cha* with these two letters, Kielhorn remarks in *op. cit.,* p. 236, that *Chaḍōbha* is evidently the place now called Ḍubkuṇḍ. But failing to see any similarity between the two names, I interpret the expression so as to take *cha* separately, and thus it is easy to explain *Ḍōbha* connected with Ḍubkuṇḍ or Ḍōbkuṇḍ, the latter of which also appears in maps, as seen above.
