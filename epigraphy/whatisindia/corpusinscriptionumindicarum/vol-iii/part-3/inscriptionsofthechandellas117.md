¹ The first of the bracketed letters may also be read as *va,* and the letter preceding it has the sign of a *pṛishṭha-mātrā* which has not been joined to the stroke at the top; it has also a redundant curve as of the medial *i.* The second of the bracketed letters I take as *drē* and not as *ḍē,* as also conjectured by Venis. The whole word appears also in the Augasī grant of Madanavarman (No. 118), where the second *akshara* is clearly *ra,* as also read by Kielhorn, who remarked that these syllables denote some particular kind or kinds of grain which he was unable to explain. But in that grant the third letter of the word is uncertain, appearing either as *ḍē* or *drē.* In the present inscription, of course, the second letter may be read either as *ra,* or *va,* and the third I take to be *drē* as the upper portion thereof ends in an angle and as it is also shown by the subscript which is faintly visible. Thus the reading of these three syllables appears to me as *kōradrē,* or *kōvadrē,* for *kodravē,* in the sense of the common millet known as *kōdō* and *kōraḍē,* as is also suggested by Venis as an alternative in the sense of ‘dry’, since this word, which is in Marāṭhī, appears to have been unfamiliar in the region of Bundelkhand.  
² The subscript of the bracketed letter is mutilated by a scratch on the plate.  
³ The *daṇḍa,* which was originally engraved, appears to have been later on scratched off as unnecessary.  
⁴ The bracketed letter was originally *sa,* later on changed to *śa.*  
⁵ Read ![](ns531.JPG)  
⁶ Both the consonants of the second *akshara* are deformed and the curve at the end of the following figure appears as the slanting stroke marking the consonant *t.* Read ![](ns532.JPG).  
⁷ The *daṇḍa* is redundant.  
⁸ As noted by Venis, this is one of the glaring examples of engraving, without caring for the exact forms of letters.  
⁹ As *n.* 21 above. Better read ![](ns533.JPG).  
¹⁰ As Venis has rightly remarked, this stroke is probably used to show that the letter preceding it is a concise form of a word like *Chaudhuri,* or so.  
¹¹ The reading of the first and the last *aksharas* of the name is uncertain.  
¹² This is a contraction of *dvivēdā* (or *–din).* and the *paṁ* that follows is a contraction of *Paṁḍita, i.e.,* Paṇḍit.  
¹³ As also in some other cases, the first *akshara* of this and also of the next two lines is completely hidden under the strip, but they are clear in the facsimile published in *Ep. Ind.,* Vol. X. facing p. 48.  
¹⁴ Venis read ─ *āsana* ─ which gives no such a meaning as may be applicable here. Therefore we have to adopt the reading as in the other grants of the house as āsavēkshu, in the sense of “palm-trees and sugar-cane”.  
¹⁵ The consonant of the bracketed letter is rather peculiarly formed and it also occupies more than the usual space. Here the use of the palatal sibilant instead of the dental appears probably due to the local influence, as we also find in some other records of the house, e.g., in No. 129.  
¹⁶ Venis read ![](ns534.JPG) but this is because he mistook the horizontal stroke joining the verticals of *dhā* for *ma.*  
¹⁷ These two letters as redundant here. See my remarks on the same word in No. 129.
