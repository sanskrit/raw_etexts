^(\[1\]) From the original stone and an impression.  
^(\[2\]) Expressed by a symbol.  
^(\[3\]) This *daṇḍa* is very close to the following letter and appears as a part of it.  
^(\[4\]) A redundant chisel stroke has made this *akshara* appear as *ṭha.*  
^(\[5\]) For all this mythical account and the origin of the Sārasvatas, see *Harsha-charita,* Ch. I.  
^(\[6\]) The word *itihāsa* has been contracted here for metrical exigencies.  
^(\[7\]) The *akshara* in the brackets is engraved as nu.  
^(\[8\]) One who conducts or is a member of an assembly. See *Vāchaspatya,* under the word, where it is stated : ![](sn61.JPG)  
Also see *Śabdakalpadruma* in M. William’s Dictionary, under ‘sabhā’.  
^(\[9\]) It is not known if the second akshara of the the name has to be read as i, for which cf. iti in the next line and again in l. 18.  
^(\[10\]) By a wrong stroke the letter in the brackets shows a combination of the dental and the palatal sibilant.  
^(\[11\]) The Sanskrit form of this name would be *Dēvaśrī.* What is intended is *nāmnīṁ,* which would not suit the metre. It may also be noted that in each of the quarters of the verse, which is *Svāgatā,* the first *akshara* which should be long has been changed to two short ones.
