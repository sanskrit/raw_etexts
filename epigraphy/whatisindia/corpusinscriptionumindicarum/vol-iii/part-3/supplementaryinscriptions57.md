**SUPPLEMENTARY INSCRIPTIONS**

where the plate was for some time deposited ; and last of all, **Varāhi** mentioned as the head-quarters of the territorial division in which the grant village was situated (l. 5), is the modern village Varahī, lying about eight kms. south by west of Nāgōd, on metalled road to Jasō and in the same region as of the well-known archaeological place Chandrehe.

**APPENDIX**

The following table shows that the produce of the village was divided into 33 shares which were donated to thirty-four Brāhmaṇas, excluding, of course, two or three in each cases mentioned in line 15 where their names and the other particulars are chiselled off. It is not necessary to presume that each of the donees received one share, for, as we are told, two of them (Nos. 3 and 4) obtained three shares each, one (No. 6) two and a half shares ; three (Nos. 1, 5) and 19) received two shares each ; five (Nos. 7, 14, 22, 29 and 33) got half a share each ; and the rest sixteen obtained one share each.

It may also be observed here that donees No. 8 to 12 appear to have been all brothers ; and Nos. 17 and 27, whose particulars are not mentioned, seem to have been, in each case, a brother of the donee mentioned just before.

*Note* :-In the table that follows, a question mark is put in the case of doubtful reading ; an asterisk to show that the particular item is not mentioned ; and two asterisks to show that the details are lost in the chisel strokes.
