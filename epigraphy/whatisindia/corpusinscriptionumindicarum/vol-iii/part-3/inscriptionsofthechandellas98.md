¹ C. read this *akshara* as *ṭha* and corrected it to *.ra,* possibly in view of the *rā* that follows. But it is not necessary as the surnames were  
changing in that age, as seen above. The actual name of the donee is not mentioned here.  
² The consonant of *Rā* may also be read as *v.*  
³ Here *agni* and not *a* as it is written before. It is an abbreviation of *agnihōtrin.*  
⁴ This name may be also read as *Sēmēka,* and in that case we have to supply the preceding *daṇḍa.*  
⁵ This name may also be read as *Gō,* with the supply of the preceding *daṇḍa.*  
⁶ Here appears a superfluous *daṇḍa,* with its top curved to right so as to appear as *piṁ.*  
⁷ As C. suggested, read ![](ns3.JPG).  
⁸ Read ![](ns4.JPG)
