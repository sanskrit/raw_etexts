**INSCRIPTIONS OF THE CHANDELLAS OF JEJAKABHUKTI**

**GARRĀ COPPER-PLATE INSCRIPTIONS OF TRAILŌKYAVARMAN**

of the king, appears to be identical with Beḍwāḍā in the Lalitpur sub-division of the Jhānsī District and situated in N.L. 24º 30’ and E.L. 78º 41’. It is most probably the same as Vaḍavāri of the Sēmrā grant of Paramardin,¹ and of the Sāgar plate of Trailōkyavarman, the latter of which is edited immediately below. **Kakaḍādaha,** where the battle is stated to have been fought (ll. 10-11) and which too is mentioned in the Sēmrā grant, has been suggested to be probably identical with Kakaḍwā or Kukurooa (N.L. 24 28’; E.L. 78 42’); this place also is in the Lalitpur sub-division. **Pāṇiülih** may have been Pannā, the headquarters of the district of the same name in Madhya Pradesh; and the granted village (of grant No. 1) **Kādōhā** appears to be identical with Kōdōa (N.L. 24º 48’; E.L. 79º 52’),² now in the adjoining district of Chhatarpur. **Vikrauṇi** and **Lōhasihāṇi**, mentioned respectively as a territorial Division and the gift-vill age included in it (grant II, l. 7), may have been Bikaura in Sāgar District (N.L. 24º 13’; E.L. 78º 41’) and Lōhāṇī, lying in N.L. 24º 23’; E.L. 79º 12’, in the Bijāwar *tehsīl* of the Chhatarpur District. A study of the situation of all these places clearly indicates that the first of the charters relates to a grant made in close proximity of the scene of the battle, and the second to a gift made in a region to its east, at some distance, and thus it is evident that Trailōkyavarman succeeded in re-establishing his authority in the central and also the western parts of his ancestral dominions.

¹ Above, No. 126, l. 8.  
² It is noteworthy that this place is only a little south of Garrā where the plates were found.  
³ From lithographs facing p. 275 in *Ep. Ind.,* Vol.XVI, subsequently comparing the text from the originals.  
⁴ A part of this *akshara,* as of some others below, is hidden beneath the protecting band.  
⁵ There is a redundant horizontal stroke running accross the vertical of the *mātrā* of this *akshara* and also across the one preceding it.  
⁶ This name can also be read as ![](nitro35.JPG).  
⁷ Because of a superfluous stroke of the chisel the consonant of the third akshara of the name appears as *dh.*  
⁸ A redundant bar runs across the verticals of this *akshara,* as also noted by Dikshit. See also *n.* 3 above.  
⁹ This is, *Rāüta.* The *daṇḍa* here and in the following line is put to show that it is a contraction.  
¹⁰ The corrections are made here in view of the expression appearing in the second grant.
