**INSCRIPTIONS OF THE CHANDELLAS OF JEJAKABHUKTI**

**AHĀR STATUE INSCRIPTION OF THE TIME OF PARAMARDIDĒVA**

of Lalitpur in the Jhānsī District and about 90 kms. south-southeast of Jhānsī itself.¹ **Vasuhāṭikā** where the family resided (l. 2), cannot be identified. It may, however, be pointed out that a village of the name of Hāṭa lies about 45 kms. due east of Bāṇapur. Similarly, we have no definite clue to identify **Ānandapura** (v. 3) ; and last of all, **Madanēśasāgarapura** (v. 3), as already mentioned above, is Ahār itself, where the inscription was found.²

TEXT³

\[Metres : Verse 1 *Āryā ;* vv. 2, 4 and 5 *Vasantatilakā* ; v. 3 *Śārdūlavikrīḍita* ; v. 6 *Rathōddhatā* ; v. 7 *Anushṭubh*\].

¹ I am indebted to Shri B. C. Jain for the information that this place contains an old temple which may probably be identified with the *Sahasrakūṭa* of the inscription.  
² Traditionally, the place is still so called as I came to know in my visit to it.  
³ From an impression.  
⁴ Denoted by a symbol.  
⁵ The sign of the *mātrā* of this *akshara* resembles the subscript *n* and the preceding *akshara* is deformed by an additional wrong stroke of the chisel.  
⁶ Both these *aksharas,* which are now lost, have been conjecturally restored from the context.  
⁷ Owing to a wrong stroke of the chisel, the bracketed *aksharas* look more like ![](ns596.JPG)  
⁸ The first of the *aksharas* in the brackets is damaged and the sign of *mātrā* on the second is not distinct on the impression. It may have been clear on the original.  
⁹ The letter in the brackets was originally engraved with the sign of *visarga,* which was later on changed to the *mātrā.*  
¹⁰ The first *akshara* of the name was originally omitted in writing and was later on inserted just above its proper place, in a smaller size. The *pada-chhēda* shows that possibly the name may also have been Udayachandra, but to accept it would involve a literary error  
*(Vidhēyāvimarsha).* ¹¹ These letters indicate the end of recording the main purpose.  
¹² These four *aksharas* have been restored from the traces left.  
¹³ The whole of this line which has faintly and partly come out in the impression, has been restored from the traces left, and the reading  
has been finalised with the help of the brochure referred to above.
