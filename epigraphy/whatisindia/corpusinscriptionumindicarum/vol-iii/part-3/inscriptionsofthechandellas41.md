**INSCRIPTIONS OF THE CHANDELLAS OF JEJAKABHUKTI**

same name in the Pannā District of Madhya Pradesh.¹ At this place a number of inscriptions of the time of the Chandēlla kings have been discovered.

The **writing,** which is damaged in the initial portion and a letter or two here and there, as can be seen from the transcript, covers a space measuring 1∙22 metres broad by 9 cms. high. It consists of four lines, as already stated above. The size of letters is about 1∙2 cm. The **characters** are Nāgarī of the eleventh century A.C. The initial *ē* shows its right limb as a vertical resembling that of *p; see ēk-ātapatraṁ,* l. 3, in which both these letters appear. The guttural nasal *ṅ* figures twice in l. 4, in *siddh-āṅganā* and *–kāraṅ = grāmaṁ,* where it is formed of straight strokes showing angles where they meet, and is also without the dot. *Ch* and *v* are almost alike; cf. *vimuchya,* l. 1. *Dh* shows a horn on the left limb; this horn is more often a slanting stroke, as in *sūtradhāraḥ,* l. 1, but occasionally it is curved and separated from the lower limb, as in *nāmadhēyō,* l. 2. *Th* which occurs only once, in l. 4, is formed of two loops placed vertically before a vertical stroke; and almost so is the letter *sh,* which too occurs only once in *maharshiḥ,* l. 2, with the distinction that its upper loop touches the top-stroke and the lower one is comparatively bigger in size. *R* which ends in a tail, *e.g.,* in *charanti,* l. 2, is sometimes engraved as *v,* cf. *grāmō,* l. 3. The sibilants *ś* and *s* present transitional forms. The former of these syllables sometimes appears in its old form beginning with a curve as in *śaila,* l. 1, but in some other instances it is without the knot in the middle of the left limb and shows a sudden bend to the right; cf. *śīlaiś-,* l. 2; its developed form almost resembles the modern one, as in *śīmā,* l. 2. Similarly the antique and the developed forms of s are to be seen side by side in *vāsaḥ svarg-aukasām,* l. 1. The dots of the sign of the *visarga* are rectangular.

The **language** of the inscription is Sanskrit; and, excepting the initial sentence denoting obeisance to Chaṇḍikā, the record is **metrically composed.** In all there are eight verses; all of them are numbered.² **Orthographically,** the following peculiarities may be noted : (1) the letter *b* is throughout denoted by the sign for *v; e.g.,* in *vivudha* for *vibudha,* l. 1; (2) in two instances out of about a dozen, the dental sibilant is put for the palatal; they are *visuddha,* l. 2 and *sāstra,* l. 3; and the palatal sibilant appears for the dental about half a dozen times out of 21; cf., *e.g.* in *śīmā* for *sīmā,* l. 3. The wrong use of both these sibilants occurs in *śāsana,* l. 4, spelt as *sāśana;* (3) consonants following *r* as doubled, *e.g.,* in *āvirvvabhūva,* l. 1, with a few exceptions like *saṁpūrṇa,* l. 4; (4) the final consonants *t* and *n* appear in their full forms in *āvir-āsīt,* l. 4 and *dhīmān,* l. 3; (5) the dipthongs are denoted by the *pṛishṭha-mātrā,* an additional upward stroke being marked for *ai* and *au;* but there are a few exceptions to this, like *–śaila,* l. 1, ¬*-tatō-* and *kṛitinō,* l. 2; (6) *dri,* is spelt as *dru* in *pītādri,* l. 4; and (7) sandhi has wrongly been observed in *sthitim-itāḥ api* put as *sthitim-itāpi* in l. 2.

The **object** of the inscription is to record the grant of the village of **Pipalāhika** and the sanction of the authority over the gates³ of the fort of **Kālañjara** in favour of one **Mahēśvara,** by the illustrious **Kīrttivarman.** Nothing besides the name of the king is mentioned in the record, but from the statement that he donated a village to Mahēśvara on whom he also conferred the authority over the gates of the fort which was then included in the dominions of the Chandēlla kings, he is none else than the king Kīrttivarman of the **Chandēlla** house, whose earliest and the latest dates are provided respectively by the Darbat inscription of 1075 A.C. and the Dēogaḍh inscription of 1098 A.C. (our Nos. 109 and 111). And the present inscription, which unfortunately bears no date, has to be placed during this period, as also indicated by its palaeography

After the auspicious symbol, the record contains a stanza in glorification of (the fort) of Kālañjara, stating that it is longed for their abode even by the inhabitants of the heaven, *i.e.,* gods. The next verse describes Brahmā who created the three worlds, and in verse 3 is mentioned Brahmā’s son *(ātmaja)* Kaśyapa, a sage who gave his name to the earth *(kāśyapī).* The following two stanzas introduce a family sprung from Kaśyapa and known as Vāstavya, in which was born **Jājūka,** who crossed the ocean of (was dexterous in) knowledge consisting of *kalā, purāṇa,*

¹ The place is situated at 24º 54’ N. Lat. and 80º 20’ E. Long. It is about 25 kms. due northeast of Pannā and about 32 kms. south-west of *Kālañjar.* Its antiquities are described by Cunningham in his *A. S. I. R.,* Vol. VII, p. 46: and Vol. XXI, pp. 46 ff.  
² The number at the end of the last verse is not visible.
