¹ As already noted by Hiralal, the letter ![](ns573.JPG) is superfluous.  
² This *akshara* is perhaps *tri,* an abbreviation of *Trivēda.*  
³ For the correct reading of the name, see *n.* 2 in p. 452 in the main article, above.  
⁴ I agree with the editor of the *Ep. Ind.,* who remarked that plural ought to have been employed here and also in l. 21 below.  
⁵ For the meaning of this expression, see *n.* 2 in p. 453 in the article above.  
⁶ It appears probable that in the original all these words are in the plural, as required by the context, but the defective engraving led Hiralal to mark improper corrections. See *n.* 4 above.  
⁷ *Āṭavika* is a government officer in charge of the forest and wild tribes.
