¹ The reading is certain, but Kielhorn read *sva-charitairu-,* which is not possible besides that it also offends against the metre.  
² This is as read by Kielhorn; but both these letters are distorted and it is possible that *-dhvajaṁ* may have been the intended reading.  
³ Read ![](lexus501.JPG).  
⁴ Both these *aksharas* are damaged beyond recognition and I have adopted Kielhorn’s reading here.  
⁵ The sense requires here something like *vidhātu-,* which also suits the metre.  
⁶ Kielhorn read these two letters as *girā,* which cannot be construed. The first of the letters is indistinct but *r* is certain.  
⁷ The nine *aksharas* ending with *stra* are distorted and are adopted here from Kielhorn’s reading. It Is, however, not known why such a place needed a protection as mentioned here.  
⁸ Originally *trē,* perhaps altered to *tra,* as Kielhorn observed.  
⁹ The *anusvāra* is faintly visible on the impression.  
¹⁰ Originally *mai.*  
¹¹ The first two letters in this line were read by Kielhorn as *mahā,* but I am confident about my reading which is also applicable here.  
¹² The bracketed *aksharas* are now totally lost and I have adopted them from Kielhorn’s reading.  
¹³ The letters *sudhā* are repeated here and the first combination of them is probably struck off in the original. Moreover, the first *akshara* we have to read as *sā.* This quarter, though of the *anushṭubh* class, offends against the metre *ślōka* which requires the sixth letter to be long.  
¹⁴ Read *Rāüta,* or *Rāṇaka.*  
¹⁵ Kielhorn me, however shows only eight and they appear as ![](lexus502.JPG) The line is complete, without space for any other letter.
