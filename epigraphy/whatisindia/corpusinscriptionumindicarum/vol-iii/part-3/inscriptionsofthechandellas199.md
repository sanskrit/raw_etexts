**INSCRIPTIONS OF THE CHANDELLAS OF JEJAKABHUKTI**

ment then closes with the date as we have seen above, and with the expressions indicating auspiciousness and great fortune’.

Of the **geographical places** mentioned in the inscription, Ḍobha (v. 19) is no other than Ḍubkuṇḍ or Ḍōbkuṇḍ, as we have seen above ;¹ and the other names, *viz.,* Jāyasapura (v. 29), Mahāchakra and Rajakadraha (l. 56) I am unable to identify. Both the latter places appear to be somewhat in the vicinity of Ḍubkuṇḍ ; but in the maps at my disposal I could not trace out any place with its name similar to either of these. However, taking all these places to have been then situated in the vicinity of the find-spot of the inscription, I am tempted to suggest that Jāyasapura may perhaps be identical with the modern town of Jasarājapura ; and Mahāchakra-grāma may have been the same as either the modern Makrērā or Mahurā, all of which are now included in the Shivapurī tehsīl in the district of the same name. Rajakadraha may have been either the modern Rājpurā or Rājōr, both of which are also situated in the same district. Lāṭa has already been identified ; and Vāgaṭa is obviously the same as Vāsaḍa, which too is well known.

¹ Also see n. on line 31 of the next below.  
² From the original and impressions.  
³ Both denoted by symbols.  
⁴ Both the bracketed letters are now lost and I have read them from the photolithograph in *A. S. I. R.,* Vol. XX. The upper curve of the *mātrā* of *pī* and the sign of *anusvāra* on *ṭha* are also lost.  
⁵ The *kākapada-*sign is engraved at the end of this and some other lines below, which is not noted separately. Again, in this line, some of the consonants are lost, leaving their *mātrās,* as shown here.  
⁶ Kielhorn read the *akshara* as *\[yu\]* but on the stone it is clear as taken here.  
⁷ Kielhorn could not make out the first of these two letters, but the traces show them on be as taken here. Both the letters are almost lost.
