**INSCRIPTIONS OF THE CHANDELLAS OF JEJAKABHUKTI**

he is undoubtedly the **Chandēlla** king bearing this name. The **purpose** of the inscription is to record the installation of an object which is not mentioned, by the illustrious *Paṇḍita* Jājō, the son of the Nāyaka *Paṇḍita* Yaśōdhara. The inscription is dated. **Thursday, the fourteenth of the bright half of Vaiśākha** of the (Vikrama) year **1240.** Kielhorn, who discussed the date in the volume of the *Ind. Ant.* which we have referred to above, has already concluded that this date regularly corresponds to **the 26th of April, 1184 A. C.,** taking the year as of the southern Vikrama era, *expired.*

Yaśōdhara and his son Jājō are not known from any other record, but from the title attached to his name, former appears to have been an influential person. No special value can be attached to the date of the record which gives only an intermediate year for Paramardin who is known to have occupied the Chandēlla throne from 1166 to 1202 A.C. In the present record, moreover, no imperial title is attached to his name, and this should not be taken to conclude that after the fall of Mahōbā in 1182, i.e., only about two years before the time when the present record was incised, he was relegated to be a petty local ruler by the conqueror, Pṛithvīrāja. The inscription is, after all, a private record and we have evidence to show that Paramardin ruled in the capacity of an imperial ruler even thereafter.¹

**FRAGMENTARY MAHŌBĀ STONE INSCRIPTION OF THE TIME OF PARAMARDIDĒVA**

\[Vikrama\] Year 1240

THE slab which bears the subjoined inscription is said to have been discovered in 1843, by General Alexander Cunningham, at **Mahōbā**⁶ in the Hamīrpur District of Uttar Pradesh. and is now in the Provincial Museum, Lucknow. It was found placed upside down as a common building stone in the fort wall at that place. Cunningham very briefly noticed the record in his *Archaeological Survey of India Reports,* Vol. XXI (for 1883-85), p. 72, with a facsimile in Plate xxii, drawing attention to its date and conjecturing it to belong to the reign of the Chandēlla king Paramardin. A brief account of the record was also published be Vincent Smith in the *Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal,* for 1879, pp. 143-44 ; and subsequently.

² From an impression.  
³ Of the *aksharas* in the brackets, the first is partly visible and the second is completely lost.  
⁴ The first of these two letters is mutilated and the second has lost its subscript.  
⁵ Probably due to some overwriting the reading of this *akshara* is doubtful.  
⁶ For the situation and antiquities of this place, see my remarks above in No. 113.
