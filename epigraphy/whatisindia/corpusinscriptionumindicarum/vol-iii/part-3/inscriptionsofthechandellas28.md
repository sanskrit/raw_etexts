**INSCRIPTIONS OF THE CHANDELLAS OF JEJAKABHUKTI**

on a full-bloomed lotus and holds a lotus-bud in each of the upper hands which are raised. The whole design is included in an oval figure of beaded borders, 8 cms. in height and 10 cms. in breadth, and divides the first six lines of the writing into equal halves.¹ Under the seat of the goddess is inscribed the **sign-manual** *Śrīmad-Dēvavarmmadēvaḥ sva-hastaḥ,* in two lines. The average height of the letters is about one cm., except for those of the second line of the sign-manual which are slightly smaller. The impression shows the plate to be in a perfect state of preservation.

The **characters** are Nāgarī. They share the characteristics of the script of those of the preceding charter which was issued only a year back ; but they are somewhat irregularly formed and slovenly incised, evincing that some of the letters and signs of the original draft were misunderstood both by the writer and the engraver. The record also abounds in grammatical and other mistakes, as will be known from the notes appended to the text that follows.

Despite this, the points that call for notice regarding the palaeography of the letters employed in the present inscription are as follows. The initial *ē* which resembles a triangle with its vertical point below, in *ēka-,* l. 5, appears as *pa* in ,i\>ēvaṁ, l. 13; *Kh* shows its older form in *vyākhyāna,* l. 17, but its advanced form in *–sākhinē,* l. 16 and *likhitaṁ,* l. 23 ; the conjunct consonant *gg* sometimes appears as *gg* as in *mārgga-,* l. 4 but as ,i\>gn, in some other cases as in *vinirggata-,* l. 16; *ṅ* has not developed its dot ; cf. *.–anaṅga,* and *–aṅganā,* both in l. 7; the letters *ch, dh,* *v* and occasionally r also are often confounded ; *e.g., ch* appears as *v* in *suchira-,* l. 11, and *cha,* l. 15, and reverse is the case in gatvā, l. 21; *r* is cut as *ch* in ,i\>–rātma, l. 15 ; *dh* is endowed with the top-stroke in *bandhu,* l. 7, but is devoid of it in *dhārā,* l. 5, where the verticals of *dhā* are also joined, as is often the case, with a horizontal stroke ; *d* occasionally appears as the modern *r, e.g.,* in *paṇḍita,* l. 16 ; and finally, *s* in *sataṁ,* ll, 11 and 12, and –*sākhāya,* l. 11, shows that this *akshara* had then begun assuming the modern form.

The **language** is Sanskrit, often barbarous and incorrect ; and in some places the case-terminations are altogether omitted, whereas in others we have wrong cases, incorrect verbal derivations, false genders, incorrect numbers, and moreover, often, putting the visarga sign unnecessarily. The record is in prose, with the exception of a verse in ll. 11-13 and six imprecatory verses in ll. 18-23 in the end, which are not numbered. In the composition the writer has evinced his fondness for similes and we also find some portions of the composition reading as parts of verses, *e.g.*, in *anushṭubh, mandākrāntā,* and *mālinī,* respectively in ll. 4, 7 and 8. With reference to **orthography,** we may note (1) the general use of the sign for *v* to denote *b* also, as in *vudvuda-,* l. 10 ; (2) the doubling of a class-consonant following *r, e.g.,* in *vargga,* l. 6 ; (3) putting the dental for the palatal sibilant in some cases, cf. *sāsana,* l. 5 and *asāsvata,* l. 13 ; (4) the wrong use of an *anusvāra* at the end of a stich ; see ll. 12 and 18 ; (5) the use of a dental nasal for the lingual ; cf. *visnu,* l. 6, *hiranya,* l. 18, *-gṛihnāti,* l. 19 and *punya,* l. 20; and finally, wrong spellings, *e.g.,* of *tri* as *truḥ,* l. 16, *jē* as *yē* in v. 6 (l. 22) but not in v. 5, and *jala* in l. 10 spelt as *yala,* some of which evince the effects of the locality. The spelling Kāliñjara (in ll. 3 and 5) and not Kālañjara, as it often appears, may also be noted with interest. In some cases the *mātrās* are detached from the letters to which they belong so as to make them appear as a *daṇḍa, e.g., in paurṇṇimā,* l. 14.

It is royal charter referring itself to the reign of the king **Dēvavarman** who belonged to the **Chandēlla** dynasty ruling at Kālañjara. The **object** of it is to record the grant of the village **Bhūtapallikā,** situated on the bank of the Yamunā river in the *vishaya* of **Navarāshṭramaṇḍala,** by the king Dēvavarman. The donee was a Brāhmaṇa-Paṇḍita named **Kikkana.**² the son of Paṇḍita Śōmēśvara and grandson of *Paṇḍita*Jayasvāmin, whose ancestors had come from a *bhaṭagrāma* known as Kumbhaṭī. He belonged to the Kṛishṇātrēya *gōtra* with the *pravaras* Ātrēya, Ārchanānasa and Śyāvaśva and to the Bahvṛicha *śākhā,* and expounded the Vēdas, the *Vēdāṅgas, Itihāsa,* the *Purāṇas* and *Mimāṁsā,* and was devoted to the six-fold duties *(shaṭ-karm-ābhirata)* obviously enjoined on the Brāhmaṇas.³

¹ This is the first of the Chandēlla grant issued with the representation of a royal emblem. ² As we find the dental nasal often put for the lingual in the present inscription, it is not possible to know whether the last letter of the name was really *na* or ,i\>ṇa. ³ See M. S., X, 75. Hiralal took these six duties to designate the practices of -*haṭha- yōga,* given under *shaṭkarma* in Apte’s Dictionary. But his statement cannot be upheld for want of evidence. It is also worth nothing here that the donee of the Nanyaurā grant of the same king also was *shaṭ-karma-rata.*
