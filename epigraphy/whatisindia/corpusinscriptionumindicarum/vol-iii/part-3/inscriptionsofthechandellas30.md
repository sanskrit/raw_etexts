¹ From an inked estampage.  
² Perhaps originally ![](lg16.JPG), corrected to ![](lg16.JPG).  
³ Hiralal read ![](lg17.JPG), but the curve above the akshara is distinct in the impression before me.  
⁴ Read ![](lg18.JPG). From ![](lg19.JPG) up to ![](lg20.JPG) the portion reads like a half of verse in Anushṭubh, of course, without the elision of a for the sake of metre.  
⁵ Originally engraved as ![](lg21.JPG) later on altered to ![](lg22.JPG).  
⁶ The meaning of this expression is not clear. The reading of the second of these aksharas is not certain, and the last of them can also be read as ![](lg23.JPG):.  
⁷ Read ![](lg24.JPG):. The visarga was inserted later on, and the vertical stroke above the loop of the second of these aksharas, and also the stroke representing the medial ā and a daṇḍa after ![](lg25.JPG), appear to have been struck off subsequently.  
⁸ Read -![](lg26.JPG). The consonant of the second of these akshara was originally incised as ![](lg27.JPG) but later on changed to ![](lg28.JPG).  
⁹ Read - ![](lg29.JPG)-. It appears that an anusvāra was originally engraved on ![](lg30.JPG) and also on the preceding ![](lg31.JPG), but both these signs were later on struck off.  
¹⁰ Read -![](lg32.JPG)-, as suggested by Hiralal. The sign of the visarga that follows is only one dot.  
¹¹ Originally ![](lg33.JPG), with the sign for medial ī chiselled off later on.  
¹² Read ![](lg34.JPG).  
¹³ To be restored to ![](lg35.JPG)-.  
¹⁴ Read ![](lg37.JPG). The sense requires the use of ![](lg38.JPG) or some such word before this.
