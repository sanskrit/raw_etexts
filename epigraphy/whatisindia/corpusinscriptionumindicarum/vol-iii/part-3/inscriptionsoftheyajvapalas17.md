**BAṄGLĀ STONE PILLAR INSCRIPTIONS OF THE TIME OF GŌPĀLADEVA**  
\[ Vikrama \] Year 1337

THE pillars which bear these inscriptions were all found on a waste land in the vicinity of a tiny hamlet known as **Baṅglā** situated about 8 kms. east of the fort of Narwar in the Shivpurī District of Madhya Pradesh. This site, which marks a battle-field, was first discovered in 1934-35 by the late M. B. Garde, who was then the Director of Archeology in the former State of Gwālior, now integrated with Madhya Pradesh. He noticed the inscriptions in general in his *Annual Report* of the department for V.S. 1991 (1934-35 A.C.), pp. 8 and 12, and enlisted seven of them in its *appendix* (Nos. 7-13). The site was also visited subsequently in 1955, by Dr. D. C. Sircar, as the Government Epigraphist of the Archaeological Survey of India, who prepared impressions of fifteen of these inscriptions ; and he edited seven of them

^(\[1\]) ![](113.JPG) is cut as mta.  
^(\[2\]) The number 23 is by mistake repeated in the original, and following it the subsequent numbers are continued. These I have retained here for the sake of facility.  
^(\[3\]) Most of the letters of the third quarter of this verse are mutilated and my reading is from the traces left. The consonant *t* is engraved as *r*, and *m* as *.bh.* Possibly *bhūtyaṁbu* is intended but it would not suit the metre.  
^(\[4\]) The reading is doubtful. The consonant of the first letter appears as s and the superscript of the second, as n  
^(\[5\]) The *mātrā* of *u* is clear, and the following *akshara* is engraved as *ga.*  
^(\[6\]) The sign of *visarga,* which was by mistake omitted first, was later on marked above its proper place.  
^(\[7\]) Some other *aksharas* were first engraved here.  
^(\[8\]) The second letter of the name is deformed. Sircar read it as *ga,* but the *mātrā* is clear on the original.  
^(\[9\]) The form of a petal is engraved after *nē.*  
^(\[10\]) These four *aksharas* are only to fill in the gap so as to complete the line. In the end, there is a heart-shaped design.
