**INSCRIPTIONS OF THE CHANDELLAS OF JEJAKABHUKTI**

side, again, the lines leave an open space which increases almost uniformly in each of the subsequent lines and thus the alignment of the record is not exactly vertical but slightly slanting inwards. The average height of the letters ranges between ∙5 and ∙7 cms.

 The **characters** of the inscription are Nāgarī of the tenth century, to which the record belongs. To note the peculiarities of the formation of some of the letters, we find that g as a subscript is engraved as *n,* cf. *svargga-,* l. 13; *ṅ* continues to be devoid of its dot, as in *bhaṅga* and *kalaṅka,* both in l. 5; and *ch, dh* and v are often alike ; see *dhavala-,* l. 3 and *chandra-,* l. 5 ; occasionally the first of these letters, *i.e., ch,* resembles v; see *chatuḥ-,* l.10 ; and in a few instances *dh* shows the beginning of a horn on its fore-limb, as in *vasudhā,* l. 12, where the verticals of *dhā* are also joined. The letters *t, n, and ś* appear in their antique form; see *nayan-āmṛita-* and *-śchandra-,* both in l. 1. P is often engraved as *y; cf. parama,* l. 6, and *y* is generally found with the curve bent upwards so as to serve the purpose of the vertical ; see *yasya,* l. 12. R, which is generally marked as a vertical with a horizontal stroke attached to the middle of its left, does resembles, v, as in *kairava-,* l. 5, and is sometimes also like *g,* as in *ravi-,* l. 8 ; this letter in its subscript form is shown by a serif ; cf. *praṇayi-,* l. 1. The signs for n and v are not frequently distinguished ; cf. *vṛiddha- and tmana-,* both in l.11, and also the signs for *ch* and v; see *chatuḥ* and *nāma-,* both in l. 10. The medial short *u* is a slanting stroke attached to the middle of the vertical and bent to the right ; see *-aśru,* l. 4; and the sign for the medial long *ū* is shown by a loop turned upwards and then suddenly bent down ; cf. *bhūmiṁ,* l. 12. A curious form of *ph* appears in *phalam,* l. 12.

 The **language** of the record is Sanskrit ; and it is written in an admixture of prose are poetry. In all these are thirteen verses which are not numbered. With reference to **orthography,** we may note (1) the use of the sign for v to denote b as well, as in *vahubhi-,* l. 12 ; (2) the general use of the *pṛishṭha-mātrā* with a few exceptions ; (3) the reduplication of a class-consonant following *r* as in *suvarṇṇa-,* l. 13, and frequently of a class-consonant preceding *r,* as in *mittra-,* l.1 ; (4) the correct use of all the sibilants and class-nasals ; and finally, (5) no change of *m* to an *anusvāra in samvatsara,* l. 7, and *samvat,* l. 8 ; and the use of the dental nasal in *pratigrihnāti.* l. 12.

 The inscription is one of **Dhaṅgadēva** of the **Chandēlla Dynasty.** Its **object** is to record the bestowal, by Dhaṅga himself, of the village **Chulli (or Yulli** connected with *Ūsharavāha,* to **Yaśōdhara** *bhaṭṭa,* son of the *bhaṭṭa* Jayakumāra of the Bhāradvāja *gōtra,* with the three *pravaras viz.,* Bhāradvāja, Āṅgirasa and Bārhaspatya, of the Vājasanēya *śākhā,* who had migrated from Tarkārikā. Yaśōdhara was the grand-father of the donee of the Nanyaurā grant of Dēvavarman, as will be discussed below while editing that grant.^(\[2\]) The present grant was made by the king for the increase of the religious merit and fame of his parents and himself, from Kāśikā *i.e.,* Vārāṇasī, on **Sunday,** the **lunar-eclipse** day in the month of **Kārttika** in the (Vikrama) **Year 1055,** as expressed both in words and numerical figures. The corresponding Christian date is Sunday, the **6th of November, 998 A. C.** when there was a **lunar eclipse** visible in India.^(\[3\])

 The inscription opens with the symbol for *Siddham,* followed by seven stanzas giving the genealogy. The first two of these stanzas introduce **Harshadēva,** mentioning him to be valorous and fierce like the scorching Sun of summer and also endowed with some other qualities. Stanzas 3 and 4 mention his son **Yaśōvarman,** who earned fame ‘by cleaving the temples of opponents’ elephants ; and the following three stanzas describe Yaśōvarman’s son, **Dhaṅgadēva,** stating that he was victorious in countless battles, righteous and just. All this description is merely poetic, the verses being good examples of the classical style of composition, containing figures as speech like *upamā, rūpaka and parisaṅkhyā.* Historically they are of no value, as all the three kings who are mentioned here with their mutual relationship are already known from the other records of the house. All these three names are repeated in the prose passage that follows and

^(\[1\]) See text, n, on the name, below.  
^(\[2\]) He also appears to be the royal priest mentioned in No. 114, v. 56.  
^(\[3\]) See *Ind. Ant.,* Vol. XVI, p. 201 and *ibid.,* Vol. XIX, p. 23, No. 5. In the former of these references Kielhorn also says that calculated by General Cunningham’s Tables, the result would be the following day, Monday, the 7th November. But considering the Tables and Kielhorn’s calculations to be correct, it is possible to hold that Sunday was the day of the eclipse and the grant was made actually on Monday when the period of the eclipse was over.
