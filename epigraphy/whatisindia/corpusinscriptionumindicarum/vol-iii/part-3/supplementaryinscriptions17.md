^(\[1\]) From Lele’s transcript in A. B. O. I., Vol. XI, pp. 49 ff. It may be noted here that his transcript does not represent the original accurately and he has made several changes, e.g., that of v to b, as is obvious.  
^(\[2\]) For the sake of convenience the verse existing on the extant portion has been taken here as I. Its metre is not certain ; and the portion commencing the second line appears to be a part of either *Mandākrantā or Śragdharā.*  
^(\[3\]) I am not certain about the metre in this line which is fragmentary.  
^(\[4\]) Insert a *daṇḍa* here.  
^(\[5\]) Here the number marking the stanza is put, of course presuming that two stanzas are fragmentary on the preceding portion which is now not available.  
^(\[6\]) This verse has lost 14 letters of the first quarter, the whole of the second quarter, and three letters of the third.  
^(\[7\]) Read -![](srs37.JPG)-.  
^(\[8\]) Read a *visarga* after this *akshara.*  
^(\[9\]) Here this *akshara* has to be taken separately in the *pada-chchhēda.*  
^(\[10\]) Read ![](srs38.JPG).  
^(\[11\]) Lele has taken this line separate but it appears to be connected with the preceding one and in continuation of it.  
^(\[12\]) This *akshara* should be prosodically long. Should we read mō with the case-ending ? ^(\[1\]) See above, Nos. 47-48 and 51.
