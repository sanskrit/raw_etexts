No. 132 ; PLATE CXIX

**CHARKHĀRĪ COPPER-PLATE INSCRIPTION OF PARAMARDIDĒVA**

\[Vikrama\] Year 1236

THIS is one of the four copper-plate grants edited by R. B. Hiralal in the *Epigraphia Indica,* Vol. XX (1929-30), pp. 125-136,¹⁰ all without facsimiles. As to their find and the present deposits, we have already remarked above,¹¹ that all of them were found with the Chief of **Charkhārī,** formerly a State in the Bundelkhand region of the Central India Agency and now included in the Hamīrpur District of Uttar Pradesh. The original find-spots of these plates are not known, and no information as to their present deposits is forthcoming ; and even an impression is now not possible to have. Under the circumstances, I edit this record from the text given by Hiralal, appending my notes to it.

The inscription is on **two plates,** both of which are incised on the inner side only. The first plate is stated to measure 60∙95 by 28∙57 cms., and the second 61∙25 by 26∙70 cms. Their  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
¹ As also noted by Venis, the sign of *anusvāra* is half engraved so as to look like a superscript *r.* Cf. the same sign on the fourth letter in l. 16 above.  
² A curve as of *ph* is attached to *ya* here, in the first of these letters.  
³ The bracketed letter appears as a loop followed by the verticals, which are also joined by a horizontal stroke as that of *dhā.*  
⁴ Because of a redundant stroke the superscript of this letter appears as *bh.*  
⁵ In ![](551.JPG)the curve of the *mātrā* is lightly engraved, it is clear on the plate.  
⁶ Read ![](552.JPG), in the light of a similar expression in the Sēmrā grant of the same king (No. 126).  
⁷ It is not known whether the sign of *visarga* was inadvertently or purposely omitted here. In the latter case, it is a somewhat rare *sandhi* but can be justified in accordance with the *vārttika* on Pāṇini’s rule VIII, 3, 36. Also better read ![](553.JPG).  
⁸ The latter part of this *akshara* is hidden under the strip referred to above.  
⁹ The sign of *visarga,* and probably also the horizontal stroke or strokes following it, are hidden under the strip.  
¹⁰ For the three other grants, see Nos. 108. 144 and 151. The present inscription begins on p. 128 (of *Ep. Ind.,* Vol. XX).  
¹¹ In No. 108.
