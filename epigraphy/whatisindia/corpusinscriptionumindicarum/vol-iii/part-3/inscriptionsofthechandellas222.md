¹ The correct form of this name is Śaratsiṁha. Also read ![](sr143.JPG)  
² The Sanskrit form of this name is Lakshmī.  
³ Insert a *daṇḍa* after this word.  
⁴ In fact, the name of the village occurs below in the text.  
⁵ *Mahanta* appears to be wrongly read for *mahattara* in the original.  
⁶ This word is not known to the dictionaries. Hall translates it by ‘class’.  
⁷ Read![](sr144.JPG) or better, ![](sr144.JPG). Some of the names occuring in the list are not Sanskrit and some without the proper case-endings, as already noted by Hall.  
⁸ The sign of zero is redundant, and what follows has to be read as ‘a half’, and not *daṇḍas.* ⁹ The *visarga* is wrongly dropped here in the original, or it is a printing error.  
¹⁰ The reading of the preceding *akshara* appears to be doubtful.  
¹¹ The correct word to be used here is *kshantavyam.*
