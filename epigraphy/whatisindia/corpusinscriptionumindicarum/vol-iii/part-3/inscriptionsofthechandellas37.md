**INSCRIPTIONS OF THE CHANDELLAS OF JEJAKABHUKTI**

![](Imp9.png)

¹ A dot above the first of these *aksharas* is probably due to a redundant stroke of the chisel, as some others in this inscription, or it may have been due to the fault in the stone. Taking the letters as with the *anusvāra,* the editor of the *Ep. Ind.* remarked that the intended reading seems to be ![](Imp10.png), *i.e.,* handful ; but recording to M. Williams, it is for *āchamana* on for rinsing the month. Moreover, the Śāstras lay down that water is poured on an image by a pot *(gaḍuka)* and (not from the palm). Katare agrees with me in reading the word as I have done here.  
² This *akshara* is wrongly engraved as ![](Imp11.png).  
³ The letters lost here may have been ![](Imp12.png), as to be restored from the traces, as also read by Katare  
⁴ It is also possible that the intended reading here may have been ![](Imp13.png): = he, by name.

⁵ This and the following sibilant show a combination of the dental and the palatal sibilants, Dr. Sircar translated the expression in “the Śaivas headed by the Pāśupata *āchāryas* and *vārikas, i.e.,* temple superintendents like the *Paṇḍās of today”,* for which see *op. cit.,* p. 164, *n.* 1. Our remark on the word *vārika* may be seen in No. 83 where too it occurs.  
⁶ I take *yēna* as an example of *Hētau tṛitīyā* and the correction in the brackets is as suggested by Dr. Sircar.  
⁷ Both these letters are indistinct in the impression but the latter appears as a conjunct consonant.  
⁸ The *akshara* in the brackets has altogether disappeared and the reading is only from the traces left Katare suggested dhi but my reading of it is more suitable.  
⁹ Read ![](Imp14.png) The superscript is perhaps *t,* wrongly engraved.  
¹⁰ The sign of *anusvāra* above *ya,* which was wrongly engraved at first, appears to have been struck off subsequently.  
¹¹ Here the *aksharas* appear to be as![](Imp15.png), but nothing can be made out of them. It is possible that a portion of the v. in l. 15, which could not be accommodated in this little space, is given below, which Katare took as a marginal note, though he has not pointed out its exact fitting, it is also possible that this half of the verse has to be completed by what is engraved in l. 17, after the portion containing the date, which, in this case, has to be taken as a paranthesis, and it would then give us the name of the engraver as ![](Imp16.png). In fact, the whole of this portion is so  
carelessly engraved and is also damaged that nothing can be said with certainly, and the suggestions made here should all be taken as tentative.  
¹² Both these *aksharas* are lost, leaving only traces. ¹³ In this notice of the inscription in *A. S. I., A. R.,* 1935-36, p. 93, Chakravarti took two  
*maṇḍapas* constructed by Vāsudeva, but this sense does not fit in the record. He appears to have taken the word in neuter dual, but it is  
masculine. The use of sati also shows that it is one (and not two), and the word is in the locative absolute. Also read ![](Imp17.png).  
¹⁴ The *daṇḍas* are redundant.  
¹⁵ Katare read ![](Imp18..png), for which see my remarks in the article above.  
¹⁶ This letter is again damaged and the reading is doubtful.
