No. 160 ; PLATE CXXXXVII  
**A YAJVAPĀLA STONE INSCRIPTION FROM NARWAR**  
(Undated and Incomplete)

THE stone bearing this inscription was discovered by M. B. Garde, the then Director of Archaeology in the (former) Gwālior State, in 1925 A.C. It was found by him in a vegetable vendor’s *(kūṅjaḍā’s)* house, at **Narwar,** an ancient town in the Karērā *tehsīl* of the Siprī (Shivpurī) District of Madhya Pradesh. Garde, who removed the stone to the Archaeological Museum at Gwālior, briefly summarised the contents of the record in the *Annual Report of* the Department for the same year, where it is stated that the inscription was engraved during the reign of Āsalladēva of the Yajvapāla dynasty. Subsequently, the record was edited by Dr. D. C. Sircar, in *Epigraphia Indica,* Vol. XXXII, pp. 65 ff., and Plate. He has rightly shown that the epigraph did not belong to the time of Āsalladēva but to that of his son Gōpāladēva. as to be seen below. The inscription is edited here from the original stone, which I examined in the Museum, and an inked impression supplied by the Chief Epigraphist, to whom my thanks are due.

 The record is inscribed on the countersunk surface of a dark pinkish stone surrounded by a plain border, and measures 64∙5 cms. broad by 61 cms. high. It consists of eighteen lines of writing, covering a space 48∙3 cms. broad by 34∙5 cms. high. But a noteworthy feature of it is that it is **incomplete.** Its last line, which contains the concluding part of verse 22, ends with the first six syllables of a new stanza, but the rest of the verse was not incised, even though there is enough space below (about 10 cms. high).

^(\[1\]) There is a redundant vertical stroke here also.  
^(\[2\]) Originally *khā* with the *mātrā* scored later on.  
^(\[3\]) These letters are partly lost and hence cannot be distinctly made out.  
^(\[4\]) Originally *syā* with the *mātrā* scored on subsequently.  
^(\[5\]) These letters too are partly preserved and cannot be made out.  
^(\[6\]) The fourth foot does not appear to be metrical.  
^(\[7\]) The decimal figure is only a dot and the tail of the limit figure appears to have been left while engraving. It may have been 9.
