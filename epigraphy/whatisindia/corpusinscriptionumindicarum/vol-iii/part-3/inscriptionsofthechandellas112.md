¹ From plate facing p. 12 in *Ep. Ind.,* Vol. XVI.  
² Denoted by a symbol.  
³ As Hiralal has already noted, this syllable in the brackets is ornamentally formed.  
⁴ A *kāka-pāda* sign is engraved here.  
⁵ In place of the superscript *r,* the sign of *anusvāra* is engraved on *rbhā.*  
⁶ This letter looks like a *ya.*  
⁷ What looks like the sign of *anusvāra,* above this letter may be a redundant stroke of the chisel, as there are some others below.

⁸ The superscript *r* of *rdi* is so mixed with the *mātrā* of the following letter as to form a graceful curve.  
⁹ The vertical stroke of *va* is omitted in the process of engraving, and thus the letter looks like *ta.*  
¹⁰ The first of these letters is apparently concealed under the protecting band, and the slanting stroke of *sh* is omitted, making the letter look like *pa.*  
¹¹ The *daṇḍa* is redundant.  
¹² Hiralal read the consonant of this *akshara* as *dh* and took the word *vāpa* to mean a measure of land. But in all the three instances in  
which this word appears in this and the next lines, this *akshara* is indistinct and my reading of is in view of my note on it in the corresponding  
portion in No. 118, above. Hiralal also observed that *mōraḷa* “is a kind of plant with sweet juice and flourishes in a kind of soil to which  
it has given its name, now corrupt into *mōraṇḍa”*. In Mālwā it is known as *mōra-dhana (dhānya).*  
¹³ *Drāṇa* and *prastha* are measures of capacity. Hiralal observed in this connection that they indicate the seed capacity whereas *vādha (pa)  * the area of land granted.  
¹⁴ The bracketed *akshara* is formed as *nu.*  
¹⁵ The punctuation mark is redundant.  
¹⁶ Here *shṇa* is carved as *pṇ.* the slanting stroke distinguishing *sh* from *p* being omitted.  
¹⁷ The *rēpha* is indistinct, but it is there.
