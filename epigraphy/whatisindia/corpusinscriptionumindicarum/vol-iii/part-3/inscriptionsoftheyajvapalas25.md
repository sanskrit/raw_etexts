^(\[1\]) The lost letters may have been ![](sn23.JPG), as in No. 162.  
^(\[2\]) Sircar observed that here the portion may have contained tīrē, but to me they appear to be traces of ![](sn24.JPG), as taken here.  
^(\[3\]) Here the name of the father may have been given but it cannot be made out completely.  
^(\[4) That is, *Rāüta.* Following it is probably the name of the hero and letters appears as ![](sn25.JPG), but the reading is uncertain.  
^(\[5\]) Whether the *daṇḍas* were followed by some more letters cannot be determined.  
^(\[6\]) From an impression which is No. 217 of *A. R. Ep., 1954-55, Appx. B.*  
^(\[7\]) The first two letters in this line are broken off, and except a letter or two here and there, the whole of the rest is lost. It is, however, included as it belongs to the battle and shows the year 1338.  
^(\[8\]) From an impression which is No. 215 of *A. R. Ep., 1954-55,* Appx. B.  
^(\[9\]) Expressed by a symbol.  
^(\[10\]) The year agrees with that in Nos. 162, 168-69 and 171 although in Nos. 164, 167, 170 and 173-174 it is given as 1338, for which see Dr. Sircar’s remarks, as already stated above.
