¹ The bracketed *akshara* also appears as *stū.*  
² See n. on the same word in l. 23. The *mātrā* of *nyu* that follows is faint.  
³ Perhaps *na* is redundant here.  
⁴ Above this letter is a faint slanting stroke appearing as a *mātrā,* erased later on.  
⁵ Probably, *Vikama-* is intended. The first and the third of the letters are misformed.  
⁶ As both the verticals are joined by a stroke, this *akshara* is *dhā* and not *vā* as read by *C.*  
⁷ The *mātrā* above this letter is faint, and the name may also be read as *Gōhaḍa* with a *daṇḍa* after as in some other cases.  
⁸ C. Proposed to correct this letter to *dvi* but it may be taken to denote Dīkshita and the change is not necessary.
