^(\[1\]) From the original stone and an inked impression.  
^(\[2\]) Denoted by a symbol.  
^(\[3\[) A *kāka-pada* sign (taken by Sircar as a *daṇḍa*) is engraved here, as also at the end of lines 8, 11 and 12, below.  
^(\[4\]) These three syllables are restored by Sircar as *Śāmbhavī,* qualifying *tanuḥ.*  
^(\[5\]) The reading of the bracketed letters is from the traces left. The name also appears in the preceding inscription, text, lines 9-10.  
^(\[6\]) Conjecturally restored by Sircar as (Sanskrit):. Two letters after ga are also missing; they are probably written above the line, which Sircar took as an unnecessary mark.  
^(\[7\]) The bracketed syllables are all damaged and the restoration is conjectural. The name Chāhaḍa is partially preserved.  
^(\[8\]) The first lacuna in this line may be conjecturally restored as *virājamānaḥ,* and the second as *prathita-pratāpaḥ.*  
^(\[9\]) The lacuna may be filled in by reading *n-ṇripa-Ā.*  
^(\[10\]) Sircar conjecturally restored these four aksharas as Lāvaṇy-ati, suggesting the name of the queen to be Lāvaṇyadēvī, as it appears also in verse 6 of the next inscription. Or, the intended reading may have been *Lōṇābhidhā,* as well, giving the Prakrit form of the name.  
^(\[11\]) To read *diṅ-mukha,* as suggested by Sircar, or, the intended reading may have been *vishṭapa,* as well.  
^(\[12\]) The reading of the bracketed *aksharas* is conjectural.  
^(\[13\]) The verse is *mātrika* and hence the short and long syllables cannot be known; and thus this long line, to show that the latter half of the verse is completely lost.  
^(\[14\]) The first of the *daṇḍas* is redundant and the second is a *kāka-pada* sign, partly visible.  
^(\[15\]) All these letters are visible in their lower parts. As Sircar observed, the intended reading may have been *kulēna cha dhanēna* *cha.*
