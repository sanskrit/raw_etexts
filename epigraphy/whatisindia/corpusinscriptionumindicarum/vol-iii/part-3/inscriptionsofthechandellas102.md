**MAHŌBĀ STATUE INSCRIPTION OF THE TIME OF PARAMARDIDĒVA**

\[Vikrama\] Year 1224

THIS inscription was brought to notice by General Alexander Cunningham in his *Archaeological Survey of Indian Reports,* Vol. XXI (for 1883-1885), p. 74 (No. 7), b publishing a transcript of its text, accompanied by a lithograph, which appears to have been prepared from an eye-copy. The record is stated to have been incised on the pedestal of a broken Jaina statue, found by him at **Mahōbā**¹¹ in the Hamīrpur district of Uttar Pradesh. Nothing about its exact find-spot is stated in the *Report,* and its present whereabouts are unknown. Thus it

¹ Read ![](np1.JPG).  
² Some of these five *aksharas* are mutilated but the reading is certain, as also seen from the plate. In view of this, we cannot agree with H. K. Sastri, who had no opportunity to examine the original and who suggested the reading to be *sa-parvv-ēkshu-,* which gives no sense. For his suggestion see *Ep. Ind.,* Vol. XVI, p. 275, *n*. 5. The word *āsana* used here has to be modified to *āsava,* in the sense of (a plant) from which spirituous liquor has to be extracted, as also used in some other grants of the house, for example, in our No. 118, l. 16.  
³ This letters is ornamentally formed and looks, like *pta.*  
⁴ C. read *śvabhra* here, but it is not suitable to the sense.  
⁵ The top-stroke of this letter is the same as the curve of the medial long *ī* above it. The *rēpha* on ![](np2.JPG) that follows is distinct on the plate but it is not deeply engraved.  
⁶ The repetition of the two letters is redundant as also in No. 119, above, from where this portion appears to have been taken.  
⁷ *Nyō* is crude. The loop is separated from the horizontal stroke.  
⁸ Read ![](np3.JPG)  
⁹ The joining horizontal stroke is either not marked or has not come out in the impression. The letter looks like *rā.*  
¹⁰ Probably to be read as ![](np4.JPG).  
¹¹ For situation and antiquities of the place, see above. No. 113, the inscription is also referred to by Smith, in *J. A. S. B.,* Vol. L, Pt. I  
(1881), p. 20.
