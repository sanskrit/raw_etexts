**AN INSCRIPTION OF THE DYNASTY OF VIJAYAPALA**

^(\[1\]) Read ![](fifitythree.JPG).  
^(\[2\]) The *mātrā* on the first of these letters was first formed as of medial long *ī* and later on corrected.  
^(\[3\]) Drop the *daṇḍa* and read the whole as ![](fifityfour.JPG).  
^(\[4\]) Read ![](fifityfive.JPG)-  
^(\[5\]) Here too is an arrow-mark.  
^(\[6\]) Read ![](fifitysix.JPG)- in the sense of a family coming from Valabhi. The *mātrā* of *kā* that follows is separated from the letter.  
^(\[7\]) Read ![](fifityseven.JPG); but it does not suit the metre.  
^(\[8\]) I am not certain about the reading of the *akshara* in the brackets and it is taken here as read by Kirtane, which appears to be possible.  
^(\[9\]) The word *sūnu* used here probably denotes a grandson, as it also means in Sanskrit, because the word *suta* is also used along with it.  
^(\[10\]) Read ![](fiftyeight.JPG);, or rather *utkīrṇaḥ,* to avoid repetition. The signs of both, the *anusvāra* and the *visarga,* are inadvertently put together. The whole line reads like a verse, though metrically defective.
