^(\[1\]) Here the pause falls wrongly by breaking the word *chāmīkara* in the separate *pādas*  
^(\[2\]) The curve of *k* is attached to the right of the vertical of *pa*.  
^(\[3\]) Read ![](john1.JPG), as also suggested by Kielhorn.  
^(\[4\]) The two *aksharas* which constitute a name have now completed peeled off and their reading is from the lithograph in *Ep. Ind.,* Vol. I, where they are slightly better preserved.  
^(\[5\]) The traces now left indicate that the bracketed *akshara* of the name was either *ga or gu.* Kielhorn takes it to be the latter.  
^(\[6\]) In the lithograph accompanying Kielhorn’s article the consonant of the bracketed letter is *t,* whereas in the impression before me it is *t altered* to *y.*  
^(\[7\]) For dropping this *visarga* and the one that follows, see *n.* on l. 2. above.  
^(\[8\]) Nine or ten *aksharas* are lost here. Kielhorn took them to be from ten to twelve.  
^(\[9\]) Originally ![](john2.JPG):  
¹⁰ Probably the word *vasudhā* is repeated here and what is intended is *–matiśaya.* Kielhorn read : ![](john3.JPG)-.  
^(\[11\]) Here is a floral design between two upright strokes on either side. It is omitted in the transcript.
