**INSCRIPTIONS OF THE CHANDELLAS OF JEJAKABHUKTI**

**GWĀLIOR STONE INSCRIPTION OF MAHĪPĀLA**

*subhaga,* both in l. 3. The left limb of *bh* sometimes ends in a long tail ; see *gabhīratā,* l. 23, *Y* is occasionally ornamental and sometimes it cannot be distinguished from *p* ; cf. *yad-ātmanā,* l. 1 and *rachitēyam,* l. 40 respectively. The letter *r* is formed at least in three different ways, *viz.,* by a vertical to which a horizontal stroke is attached at the left, with a loop, and with a wedge, as respectively to be seen in *Purushōttama, vara* and *vismaya-kāri,* all in l. 17. And lastly, the subscript form of this letter is represented either by its full form, with the preceding letter half drawn, as in *chakrirē,* l. 6, or by a serif attached to the lowest extremity of its superscript, as in *sahasra-,* l. 5. The loops representing the sign of *visarga* have a triangular notch between them.

The **language** of the inscription is Sanskrit ; and with the exception of the introductory *Oṁ ōṁ namaḥ Padmanāthāya* and the expressions showing the date in l. 40, the entire inscription is in verse. The total number of verses is 112 ; they are not numbered. The language is correct and fluent, containing elegant and florid expressions as in the best Kāvya style using figures of speech like *upamā, rūpaka, ślēsha, sandēha, apahnuti, vyatirēka* and also *parisaṅkhyā* which is of rare occurrence.¹

In respect of **orthography,** we have to note (1) the use of the sign for *v* to indicate *b* as well, except in *s(ś)aury-ābdhinā,* l. 5 where it is correctly used, but also in *bapah,* l. 1 where it is wrong ; (2) putting the dental for the palatal sibilant in a large number of instances as in *-aṁsu,* l. 8 but the use of *aṁśu* also to be seen in l. 29 ; on the other hand, the use of the palatal for the dental sibilant, *e.g.,* in *śāśan-ōdita,* l. 34. Here it may be pointed out that the word *śaśvat* occurring three times in the inscription is spelt as *sasvat* twice in ll. 12 and 25 but as *śasvat* in l. 19 ; (3) the reduplication of a consonant, more often, following *r* and occasionally, also preceding it ; see, *e.g., gīrvvāṇa-manttr = iva,* l. 41 ; (4) writing *ch* frequently as *chh,* see *vānchchhaḥ,* l. 22 ; (5) the use of the *jihvāmūlīya* instead of the lingual sibilant in four instances all of which occur in l. 36 ; (6) the general tendency to put the *parasavarṇa* which is sometimes so strong that the final *m* is wrongly used in instances like *tvam = viśuddha,* l. 25 and in combining the expressions tvam and *kō =si* as *tvamko = si,* which though grammatically correct, gives an idea of clumsiness, in ll. 20 and 25 : (7) the change of a final m occasionally to an *anusvāra* at the end of a stich, *e.g.,* in l. 37 ; and (8) a few instances of putting the *daṇḍa* so close to the preceding letter as to appear as a medial *ā* attached to it, as after *bhagavān* in l. 3. Some of the lines have the *kāka-pada* sign as the end.

The inscription refers itself to the reign of **Mahīpāla** who belonged to the **Kachchhapaghāta** dynasty of Gwālior. The **object** of it is to record the completion of the temple of Padmanātha, begun by his cousin **Padmapāla** and the grants made by the king in honour of the deity installed therein and in favour of some Brāhmaṇas. The **date** of the record is expressed in l. 40, in words, to be the **expired Vikrama year 1149,** and it is repeated in figures in the same line, as the **current year 1150, the day being the fifth of the dark half of Āśvina.** The date does not admit of verification, though it is one of the few dates mentioning both the current and the expired era. The year corresponds to 1092 A.C., taken as Northern.

The inscription falls into three parts, the first of which (vv. 5-33) gives an account of the king **Mahīpāla** and his ancestors, the second (vv. 34-67) glorifies him in bardic expressions, and the third (vv. 68-103) records the construction of the temple and the establishment of a Brāhmaṇa colony in its vicinity and the endowments made to them.

Opening with a short sentence paying obeisance to Padmanātha and after four *maṅgalaślōkas* in praise of Aniruddha, Hari and Ushā’s husband installed in the temple, in 26 verses it describes the genealogy of the **Kachchhapaghāta** (kachchhapāri, as mentioned in verse 5-7) family to which Mahīpāla, who completed the temple belonged. Here we are told that the originator of the house was **Lakshmaṇa** (v. 5). His son was **Vajradāman** who by honest means put down the valour of the ruler of Gādhinagar **(Kānyakubja) and performed tulā-dāna** a number of times (vv. 6-7). He was succeeded by **Maṅgalarāja,** who was a Śaiva (v. 8), and the

¹ These remarks are with reference only to verses 1∙68 forming the first two parts of the inscription. With the exception of a few verses, the rest of the record, which merely gives names and lists of articles is in the poetic form but not of the same high rank. With reference to the language it is interesting to note that in three instances, in 11, 14, 29 and 33, the *visarga* followed by *s* is dropped which is against Pāṇini VIII, 3, 36 but quite in accordance with the *vārttika* on the same.
