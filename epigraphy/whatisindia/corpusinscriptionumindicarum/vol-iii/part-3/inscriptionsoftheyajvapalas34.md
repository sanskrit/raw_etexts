No. 177 ; PLATE CXLII  
**SĒSAI PILLAR INSCRIPTION OF THE TIME OF GŌPĀLADĒVA**  
\[ Vikrama \] Year 1341

THIS inscription is on a memorial stone pillar in the tiny hamlet of **Sēsai** on the Agra-Bombay road, situated about 15 kms. south of Sīprī (Shivpurī), the headquarters of a distrcit of the same name in Madhya Pradesh. It was discovered in 1914, by M. B. Garde, the Superintendent of Archaeology in the former State of Gwālior, and was brought to notice by him in the *Annual Report* of the department for that year (i.e., V.S. 1971), which is not available in print.^(\[5\]) The pillar was again found at the same place by Dr. D. C. Sircar, in 1955, in his tour in the Shivpurī District ; and from the impressions then prepared by him, he edited the record, along with some others, in the *Epigraphia Indica ,* Vol. XXXI (1957), pp. 323 ff, with its transcript in Roman characters. The record is edited here from one of the those impressions which were taken by Dr. Sircar and kindly supplied to me by Dr. G. S. Gai, the Chief Epigraphist of the Archaeological Survey of India.^(\[6\])

The inscription consists of twelve lines of writing, covering a space about 30.5 cms. broad by 20.3 cms. high, and has suffered from long exposure to weather. Its preservation is not satisfactory. The mechanical execution was rather sloven. The average size of the letters is 1. cm.
