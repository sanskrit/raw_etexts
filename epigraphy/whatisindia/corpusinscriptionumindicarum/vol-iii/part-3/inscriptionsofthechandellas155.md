**INSCRIPTIONS OF THE CHANDELLAS OF JEJAKABHUKTI**

stroke of the *mātrā,* as in *virōdhi,* l. 2. The characters generally exhibit a distinct slanting curve at their right hand bottom.

The *aksharas* were well written, but their incision betrays carelessness on the part of the engraver, who, besides leaving some redundant strokes, is prone to make superfluous additions and omissions deforming their shapes, as we find in the Sēmrā grant of Paramardin.¹ Instances of this sort of slovenliness are pointed out in the text or the foot-notes appended to it.

The **language** is Sanskrit, which is generally correct ; and except for one verse in the beginning and two imprecatory verses in the concluding portion, the records is all in prose, being almost a copy of the preceding grant so far as the initial portion is concerned, the change being observed only in the formal portion. As regards **orthography,** (l) *b,* as usual, is denoted by the sign for *v*, cf. *vādhā,* l.17 ; (2) the dental and the palatal sibilants are often confounded with each other even in very common words like *paśu* written with the dental and *kusuma* with the palatal in lines 14 and 15 respectively ; (3) a class-consonant following *r* is not unoften doubled, *e.g.,* in *parṇṇa-,* l.16, and sometimes this sort of reduplication is also noted when the consonant precedes *r, e.g.,* in *tattra,* l. 2 ; (4) the sign of *anusvāra* is used more often than the sign of the nasal ; (5) the influence of the local element is noticed in the spelling of *Jāmadagnya* written as *Yāmadagnya* in l. 12 ; and lastly, (6) the use of the *pṛishṭha-mātrā,* which is in some instances as put as to be confounded with a *daṇḍa* and *vice versa.*

It is a **royal charter** recording the donation of land by the illustrious king **Trailōkyavarman,** who is endowed with the usual royal titles and is also stated to be the sole lord of Kālañjara and belonging to the **Chandēlla** house. The initial portion mentions the genealogy of the king in the same way as the Garrā plates. The formal part of the present record begins in l. 7 stating that the king granted, from his encampment at Ṭiharī, the village Maṇḍāüra included in the *vishaya* (territorial division) of Vaḍavāri in the “administrative or territorial unit” in Sihaḍoṇi”.² The donee was a Brāhmaṇa named Kulēśarman, who had hailed from Rawkōra and was a son of *Nāyaka* Gayādhara, a grandson of *Rāüta* Sīhaḍa and a great-grandson of Rāüta Naugrahaṇa (?).³ He belonged to the Vatsa *gōtra,* with five *Pravaras, viz.,* Vatsa, Bhārgava, Chyavana, Aurvva and Jāmadagnya, and was a student of the Vājasanēya *śākhā.*

The inscription is **dated** in II. 10-12, in the year 1264 (expressed both in figures and words), on the **second tithi of the dark half of the month of Bhādrapada**, on *Śukradina,* or **Friday.** The year must of course be taken as belonging to the Vikrama era, and, as has been calculated by Katare, the details of the date regularly correspond to **29th August, 1208 A.C**.⁴

Lines 14-18 contain the usual admonitions to give to the donee whatever might be due to him and not to obstruct him enjoying the gift; and with two customary benedictory and imprecatory verses followed by the **sign-manual** of the king Trailōkyavarman in ll. 18-19, the record comes to a close.

While dealing with the Garrā grants of 1205 A.C. we have seen that immediately after his accession Trailōkyavarman consolidated his strength, and driving away that Muslim forces from the region, he succeeded in regaining his ancestral kingdom some time before that date. The present grant, which was issued about three years subsequently, goes to indicate that in 1208 he was again in the same region in which line the place of his camp mentioned in the present inscription, *viz.,* Siyaḍōṇi, which is only about 50 kms. due north-west of Vaḍavāri where he

² It is difficult to reconcile the mention of *Sihaḍōṇi-sainyē,* l. 7, with *Ṭiharī-samāvāsē* in l. 10. While editing the inscription, Dr. Katare is inclined to hold that “the announcement of the grant was made at the Sihaḍoṇi military camp (*sainyē*), and the king, when he actually issued it, was residing at Tehri”. Dr. D. C. Sircar, while publishing Katare’s article, observed that ‘The Language of the record shows that Sihaḍauṇi was the name of an administrative or territorial unit in which the gift land was situated” *(op. cit.,* p. 71, *n*. 4). But we find the *vishaya* actually mentioned in l. 7 as *Vaḍavāri,* and Dr. Sircar appears to have ignored it. It appears to me, however, that the grant was issued when the king was residing at Ṭehri and his forces were encamped at Siyaḍōṇi which is not far off from the camp, being distance from the scene of the battle, though not far from it.  
³.As we have so often remarked, this is another example to show how the surnames were subject to change with generations.
