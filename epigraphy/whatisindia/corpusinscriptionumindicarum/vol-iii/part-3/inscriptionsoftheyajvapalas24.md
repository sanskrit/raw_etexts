\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
¹ From an impression which is No. *213 of A.R. Ep., 1954-55, Appx.* B. The letters are extremely damaged.  
^(\[2\]) Expressed by a symbol.  
^(\[3\]) The sign of *visarga,* if engraved, is smaller in size.  
^(\[4\]) As in the corresponding portion of the preceding records. Here the person seems to be called a mantrin.  
^(\[5\]) Read ![](sn11.JPG).  
^(\[6\]) As already noted by Sircar, these are probably the sons of the person who died in fighting.  
^(\[7\]) Lines 6-8 are damaged and therefore indistinct.  
^(\[8\]) From an impression which is No. 223 of *A. R. Ep., 1954-55, Appx,* B.  
^(\[9\]) Expressed by a symbol followed by two illegible letters which appear as traces of Svasti.  
^(\[10\]) The number showing the *tithi* is lost here.  
^(\[11\]) Read ![](sn12.JPG), which is followed by 2 or 3 letters which I cannot make out as they are carelessly formed.  
^(\[12\]) Sircar observed that the broken letters may have been ![](sn13.JPG), and the reading has to be adopted here. They are in the form of traces only.  
^(\[13\]) See n, on the corresponding portions in Nos. 165, 166 and 174.  
^(\[14\]) Possibly to be read as ![](sn14.JPG). The rest of the inscription, which contains four lines, is illegible.  
^(\[15\]) From an impression which is No. 218 of A. R. Ep., 1954-55, Appx.  
^(\[16\],) This portion which is broken, may have contained the year and the name of the month. Also whether the consonant of the following akshara is  
dental or palatal cannot be ascertained.  
^(\[17\]) Possibly to be restored to ![](sn15.JPG)-.  
^(\[18\]) The letters are not clear in the impression but lacunas may conjecturally be filled in by ![](sn16.JPG).
