¹ Kielhorn doubtfully read *–kulēna* and stated that the construction is wrong. But the bracketed *akshara* appears to be *chha,* as was also guessed by him. The lower parts of both the consonants are joined, and thus it is not *ku.* The expression means *viśikhāyām* (on the highway) or *viśikhābhiḥ* (with arrows). For this use of *chhalēna* cf. *parikhā-valaya-chhalēna* and *parikhā-kapaṭa-* in the *Naishadhīya- Charita,* II, 95 and 79, respectively.  
² Read *–nāmadhēyē.* The correction appears to have been made in the original, as also noted Kielhorn.  
³ Originally *vā,* with the second vertical scored off by two horizontal strokes. The idea of connecting *vaśa* with the name *vāśē* is peculiar. *Atra* in this verse is also unnecessary.  
⁴ A *kāka-pada* symbol appears here and also at the end of the next line.  
⁵ The construction in this verse is faulty, as the verb which is used in the active voice in its first three quarters is suddenly changed to the passive in the fourth.  
⁶ As also noted by Kielhorn, the verse does not admit of a proper construction. Besides, the redundant use of words may be noted in the second quarter and in *Kailāsa-vāsōpamē,* which means only Kailāsa. Here ati is misplaced.  
⁷ Possibly *ā* is changed to *a* in the original, as also noted by Kielhorn.  
⁸ The consonant of this letter is deformed and a part of it is lost in a scratch on the stone. But it is definitely lingual and not dental as read by Kielhorn. Compare the form of this letter in -*aṅgaṇēshu* and *-anaishīt,* which is unlike that of *s* occurring in *tāsu sakalāsu kalāsu* in the same line. Ashau appears to be the name of his son.  
⁹ Read ![](rd24.JPG) *Rauchcha* is altered to *rōchchhai* and *sa* to *si* in the original, as also noted by Kielhorn.  
¹⁰ A *Kāka-pada* sign is engraved here.  
¹¹ The sign as above. The name Mahīpāla is changed to Mahipāla in the first foot of this verse is probably for metrical exigency.
