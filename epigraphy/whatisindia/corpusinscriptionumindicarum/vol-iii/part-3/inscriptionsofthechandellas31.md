**INSCRIPTIONS OF THE CHANDELLAS OF JEJAKABHUKTI**

¹. This *akshara* has a redundant chisel stroke above and it is also separated from the following letter by some space showing another redundant chisel stroke. Similarly, there are some redundant strokes over some of the following *aksharas.*  
² The vertical strokes are redundant. A top-stroke representing the medial *ē* was originally incised stone (Sanskrit) and subsequently struck off, is unnecessary. This verse is from Bhartṛihari’s *Vairāgya-ataka.*  
³ Hiralal put a query mark after these six *aksharas* ; but to me they appear to be restored to ![](image25.jpg) The subscripts of both the bracketed letters that follow are formed alike, though they are different.  
⁴ What is perhaps intended is ![](Image9.jpg).  
⁵ This *akshara* is incised as (Sanskrit) and the same in
-![](Image26.jpg)- that follows has an oblique stroke separated from its loop.  
⁶ Read ![](Image10.jpg) or ![](Image29.jpg). appears somewhat like ![](Image27.jpg), as it was actually read by Hiralal.  
⁷ Read ![](Image18.jpg) is redundant here.  
⁸ The name of the third *pravaras*can also be read in the original as ![](Image28.jpg). But read the whole as ![](Image30.jpg), following the *Gōtrapravaranibandhakadamba.*  
⁹ The last but one *akshara* has the sign of medial *ai* above it, which is superfluous.  
¹⁰ Read ![](Image31.jpg) \|  
¹¹ Read ![](Image32.jpg).  
¹² The figure 2 is intended to show the repetition of the preceding word. Cf. above, No. 91. Text, l. 3.  
¹³ The *daṇḍa* is superfluous.  
¹⁴ Read the latter half of this verse as ![](Image21.jpg).  
¹⁵ The *akshara* in the brackets was originally engraved as ![](Image33.jpg) and then altered to ![](Image22.jpg).  
¹⁶ This form of the verb in singular whereas that of the subject is plural. Read in the first half ; ![](Image35.jpg)  
¹⁷ These four *aksharas* are as actually engraved in the original. Restore: ![](Image37.jpg).  
¹⁸ The *daṇḍa* is superfluous and the *sandhi* is not made *metris causa.*
