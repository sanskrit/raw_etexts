No. 98: PLATE XCIV  
**KHAJURĀHŌ STONE INSCRIPTION OF YAŚŌVARMAN**  
\[Vikrama\] Year 1011

THE stone which bears this inscription is said to have been discovered, some time after 1843, amongst the ruins at the base of a temple known as the temple of Lakshmaṇajī at **Khajurāhō**^(\[14\]) in the Chhatarpur District of the Vindhya region of Madhya Pradesh, and is now built into the wall inside the entrance porch of the temple. The inscription was briefly noticed by Genera Alexander Cunningham in his *Archaeological Survey of India Reports,* Vol. II, (1862-1865), pp. 425 f.^(\[15\]) and again in *ibid.,* Vol. XXI (1883-1885), pp. 65 and 84, where a small photograph of it was also published on Plate xvii-B. The record was first edited by F.

^(\[1\]) Metre: *Śārdūlavikrīḍita.* Kielhorn read the first letter in this line as (Sanskrit), but the vertical stroke that distinguishes it from (Sanskrit) is clear. It may also be noted that the last letter in this line is totally lost and has been adopted from Kielhorn’s reading.  
^(\[2\]) Metre: *Upajāti.* Kielhorn’s reading of the last two *aksharas* is (Sanskrit), but on the plate the first is a clear *ha* with the *mātrā* very distinct.  
^(\[3\]) Metre : *Sragdharā,* or *Mandākrāntā,* the last caesura of both of which is identical in syllabus.  
^(\[4\]) Metre : *Anushṭubh.* Kielhorn read the first letter of the line as (Sanskrit) but the initial loop of the letter in only ornamental.  
^(\[5\]) Metre : *Sragdharā,* or *Mandākrāntā.*

^(\[14\]) Kujrow of the *Indian Atlas,* sheet No. 70. Situated at N. Lat. 24 ̊ 51’ and E. Long 80 ̊, this place is 43 kms. east of Chhatarpur and  
55 kms. south of Mahōbā, and is now connected with a metalled road with each of these places. The antiquities of this place are described  
by Cunningham in his *A. S. I. R.,* Vol. II. pp. 412 ff. *ibid.,* Vol. X. pp. 16 ff. and again in *ibid.,* Vol. XXI, pp. 55 ff.  
^(\[15\]) Cunningham found the slab placed ‘sloping against the wall’ of the temple, and he also remarked that it was not seen by Burt in  
 1838, but was obtained in course of repairs carried on to this temple by the Chhatarpur Rājā some time after 1843. In Burt’s time the temple  
was known as of Chaturbhuj.
