^(\[1\]) See *n.* 3 on the preceding page.  
^(\[2\]) Read ![](vrl8.JPG).  
^(\[3\]) The *akshara* in the brackets has now peeled off but it is clear in the Plate in *Ep. Ind.,* Vol. I.  
^(\[4\]) Read ![](vrl9.JPG):, as already suggesed by Kielhorn.  
^(\[5\]) The sign of visarga was inserted afterwards. This akshara is a combination of both the palatal and the dental sibilant.  
^(\[6\]) Both the bracketed letters are now lost and the reading here is from the context.  
^(\[7\]) Read ![](vrl10.JPG)-.  
^(\[8\]) The bracketed *akshara* is now lost, as some others also, below, which are not put in rackets when they can be made out from the context.  
^(\[9\]) Read ![](vrl11.JPG):. The reading of the preceding *akshara* is certain but it appears to have been intended for ![](vrl12.JPG).  
^(\[10\]) Kielhorn translated this expression as ‘a thousand eyes of averted enemies became closed’. To me, however, with the correction of *tta to tra,* it appears to mean that the thousand eyes of *Vṛittra-śatru,* i.e. Indra, became closed (for fear of another enemy though he had slayed the demon Vṛittra, as mentioned in the *Ṛig-Vēda).* Similarly, the seventeenth *akshara* in the first quarter of this verse is as written here, and not *bhē,* as taken by Kielhorn. The traces show it to have been *rō,* and *rōdōntarālē* means the space between the earth and the sky, which is quite appropriate. Kielhorn omits this expression in his translation.
