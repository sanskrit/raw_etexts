¹ From inked estampages.  
² Parts of ![](sr126.JPG), as of some other *aksharas* in this line, are visible in the impression, but the sense cannot be made out.  
³ Here the missing letters may have been ![](sr127.JPG)  
⁴ Here and below, the dots represent the numbers of the *aksharas* which are lost.  
⁵ It may here be noted that whereas the stanza in the *Kumāra-Saṁbhava* (I. 43) describes the face of Pārvātī, it is utilised here to glorify a male face.  
⁶ Though correct according to the *sandhi*-rules, the metre requires this word to be read as in the brackets.  
⁷ Read ─ ![](sr128.JPG)  
⁸ This *daṇḍa* is redundant.  
⁹ This verse compares the king to the Sun, by the double meanings of ![](sr129.JPG) (i) a foot and (ii) a ray; ![](sr130.JPG) (i) a king and (ii) a mountain; ![](sr131.JPG) a vice, and a night; and ![](sr132.JPG)(i) a lord and (ii) the Sun.  
¹⁰ Here is an eight-spoked wheel between double *daṇḍas.* Somewhat similar signs of inter-punctuation also occur in the Dubkuṇḍ inscription, and, as noted by Hultzsch , at the end of the Kōṭā Buddhist inscription of the Sāmanta Dēvadatta *(Ind. Ant.,* Vol. XIV, p. 46) and in a Gwālior inscription of Bhōjadēva (*Journ. of the German Ori. Soc,* Vol. XL, p. 35).  
¹¹ This word goes with the word that follows and hence in plural.  
¹² This is, even Bṛihaspati is *laghu, i.e.,* unable.
