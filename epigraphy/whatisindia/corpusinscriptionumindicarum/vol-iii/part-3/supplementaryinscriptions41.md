^(\[1\]) The *anusvāra* is redundant. The hyphen is used by me, to denote the end of one title. The preceding ![](srs85.JPG) is not necessary in the *samāsa.*  
^(\[2\]) The reading is uncertain. Probably to be restord as *antē* (near its end), or, antar-, (inside it).  
^(\[3\]) The same as Drāṅgika, i.e., the officer in charge of a town, for which cf. the Ūnā inscription, Ep. Ind., Vol. IX, pp. 4 f. Also see C.I.I., Vol. III, p. 169, n. 6. Or, with the supply of u at the beginning. Udraṅga-varishṭha, i.e., an officer who collected levy. Cf. C.I.I., Vol. III, p. 97, and n.  
^(\[4\]) The letters in the brackets have left only traces. The use of the initial i in vishaïka that follows is noteworthy, instead of yi.  
^(\[5\]) The sign of visarga, which can be seen only on the original, was inserted later on. The daṇḍa that follows is redundant.  
^(\[6\]) The bracketed akshara is formed as yaṁ.  
^(\[7\]) Read ![](srs86.JPG)-. A redundant daṇḍa is engraved after ![](srs87.JPG) that follows.  
^(\[8\]) Probably what is intended is śāntis. The five śāntis, to propitiate the grahas, pitṛis, bhūtas, dēvas, and Brahman.  
^(\[9\]) Read ![](srs88.JPG). ^(\[10\]) The daṇḍa in this and the following lines are redundant.  
^(\[11\]) Read ![](srs89.JPG).  
^(\[12\]) The daṇḍa is engraved as a pṛishṭa-mātrā of the following latter. This śākhā is not known to me. Probably Vājasanēyī is intended (?)  
^(\[13\]) The correct form of the first of the names is Pavanāha ; and of the second, Vāmana. The consonant of the first akshara of the latter name can also be read as ch.  
¹⁴ Read –![](srs90.JPG):, but the meaning of ān tara is not clear in this reading. Probably what is intended is “in the neighbourhood”, or â€œanotherâ€?.
