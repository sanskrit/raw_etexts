**INSCRIPTIONS OF THE CHANDELLAS OF JEJAKABHUKTI**

^(\[1\]) As also remarked by Kielhorn, the first of the *aksharas* looks like *ha* in the impression ; and the impression before me shows some of the following *aksharas* more damaged than in the lithograph accompanying his article; this lithograph too I have consulted in my transcript of this verse.  
^(\[2\]) All these *aksharas* are so damaged as to give no certain reading. Kielhorn read the last four as ![](avi1.JPG), but they do not give any intelligible sense.

^(\[3\]) In place of the bracketed letter some other *akshara* was originally engraved.  
^(\[4\]) Here I suggest the reading ![](avi2.JPG).  
^(\[5\]) The *aksharas* from *thē* to *cha* are broken and the reading is uncertain ; it is adopted from Kielhorn, but the sense is not clear. And what is more is that *ta* appears to have been followed by a conjunct consonant which is necessary to stress is metrically. For dropping the *visarga* here, see *n.* above.  
^(\[6\]) I fail to see the alteration of this *akshara* to ![](avi3.JPG), as suggested by Kielhorn, though I agree with him in taking the following two *aksharas* looking similar to ![](avi3.JPG). The reading of all the three letters appears to be ![](avi4.JPG).  
^(\[7\]) For dropping the *visarga,* see n. above, on l. 2.  
^(\[8\]) The *aksharas* of the fourth quarter of this verse here all peeled off and the reading is as of Kielhorn.  
^(\[9\]) The reading of the *aksharas mahaḥ* is from the traces left. Kielhorn read them as *mahā* with some hesitation; but coupled with *Śrī* they do not give a good sense. The reading I have adopted is in the sense of ‘the splendour of the moon-shine’. The verse, which is an example of the figure of speech known as *vyatirēka,* means to say that the bright fame of the king proceeds to that region (i.e., the vault of heaven) which was reached neither by the stride of Vāmana, the dwarf incarnation of Vishṇu, nor even by the Sun. The first of these allusions refers to Vāmana extending his steps so as to measure the earth and the sky, and the second to the mythical mountain that encircles the earth and beyond which is a region of complete darkness where the Sun’s rays do not reach.
