¹ This *daṇḍa* is redundant, as also some others below.  
² Read ![](nos801.JPG).  
³ The consonant of *ṭu* is formed as *d* and the curve of the *mātrā* on *vi* is not cut.  
⁴ The curve of the *mātrā* on the first and the whole of it on the third letter is missing.  
⁵ The sign of the superscript *r* is very faint.  
⁶ Both the bracketed *aksharas* are misformed.  
⁷ The curve of the *mātrā* of *dhi* is partly visible and is joined to the vertical.  
⁸ Both the consonants of the bracketed letter are misformed. In the word saṁvat that precedes, it cannot be ascertained whether the consonant is marked, as the verticals of most of the letters in this inscription have their lower ends slightly bent to the right.  
⁹ Each of the names of the *pravaras* here is separated by a *daṇḍa* so often used in the Sēmrā grant of the same king. Read ![](nos802.JPG). *Ṭh* and *Paṁ* in this line are contractions of *Ṭhakkura* and *Paṁḍita, i.e.,* Paṇḍit, respectively.  
¹⁰ In the other records the name appears as *dhā ī.* See. The *anusvāra* on *dhā* appears to have been struck off but the mark is still visible.  
¹¹ The sign of *mātrā* of *pū* appears as a subscript *n.*  
¹² Sircar suggest the correction of this word to *gāminī,* but in the compound word this qualifies *hala* and thus the emendation does not appear to be necessary.  
¹³ The consonant of the bracketed *akshara* was originally cut as *th.*  
¹⁴ The curve of the *mātrā* of *di* is missing and the horizontal stroke before the letter is also missing.  
¹⁵ In this and the following line there are a number of redundant strokes appearing as the signs of *anusvāra.*  
¹⁶ The letter in the brackets is engraved as *la.* ¹⁷ Originally *yī,* with the earlier part of the curve scored off so as to make it the sign of superscript *r.*
