¹ Mirashi suggests to read the following two letters as *–rmāna-,* but following his suggestion, we miss here the finite verb. The lacunae may conjecturally be restored as ![](nos5.JPG).  
² This word has to be construed with the first word in the second quarter of the verse. Mirashi reads *prāsāda-sphaṭika-,* which cannot be construed.  
³ The slanting stroke of the *mātrā* above this letter is wrongly cut on the preceding one.  
⁴ The bracketed and the preceding *akshara* are mutilated.  
⁵ These three letters may have been *-rapāhṛi-.*  
⁶ A redundant stroke makes this letter appear as *bha,* for which cf. *bhavana* in l. 15.  
⁷ Suggesting correction of *nē* to *nai,* Mirashi translates this expression as “the only son of Nōnē” ; but it also appears possible that the name was Nōnē and the suffix *ka* may have been added to it for metrical exigencies, or, what appears to be more probable, to give a form of the *shashṭhī* of the word Nōnē, as we find in some other grants of the house, *e.g.,* in No. 126. This suffix is added to the name to form its case even today by those who have only some smattering of Sanskrit.  
⁸ The *akshara* in the brackets has disappeared, leaving only traces. The letter *kshma* that follows is engraved as *kdma.*  
⁹ The bracketed *akshara* is totally lost and I have adopted the reading as suggested by Mirashi. But it may also have been *bha.*  
¹⁰ This lacunae may conjecturally be restored by the reading ![](nos6.JPG)  
¹¹ The unit figure is ornamental with four *nandipādas* around it and only one of them is complete. The vowel that follows is formed differently from others in the inscription.  

¹² This *akshara* is deformed by a redundant chisel stroke.  
¹³ Only the vertical of the *mātrā* and the first half of this letter are visible.  
¹⁴ After I finished my article on this inscription. I had an opportunity to see what N. P. Chakravarti wrote on it in the section on Epigraphy in *ASI., AR.,* 1936-37. He remarked that in the fourth line of the extant portion of the epigraph the name of Madanava \[rman\*\] is found partly preserved. But in my examination of the original I found that through the first of the bracketed letters ending the line may be doubtfully takes as *ma,* the second and the fourth the them are conjuncts and thus not fitting in the name. Again, in l. 22, he took the name as Ahallaṇa, which, of course, may be possible, as shown by the *padachhēda.* In 14, he read the name as Nolaka and not Nonēka, as taken by me and also by  
Dr. Mirashi. The consonant of the second akshara appears also as l. but the sign of the *pṛishṭha-mātrā* before it is absolutely certain and cannot be overlooked.
