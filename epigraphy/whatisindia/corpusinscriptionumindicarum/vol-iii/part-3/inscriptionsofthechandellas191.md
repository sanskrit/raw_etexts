¹ The punctuation sign, as some other below, is superfluous. The two letters that follow are distorted.  
² The two bracketed *aksharas,* which also occur below in ll. 5 and 6, were taken by Hiralal as *sāhi,* but to me they appear to be as in the transcript. In each case, as we note, the immediately preceding letter has the sign of the medial *ē* before it, showing that it is a change of the vowel *i* of the complete word *ity-ādi.* Besides this we have also to note that the engraving in this plate was done in a slipshod manner, for the sign of *d,* see *Vēdē-,* l. 9, *-dēvō-,* l. 7, and *vadi,* l. 13, where it is formed as almost resembling *h.*  
³ The *akshara* has a redundant curve attached to its vertical, and the inner slanting stroke of *sh* is cut as a loop making the *akshara* appear as *kh.* The following *du* is also misformed.  
⁴ A redundant sign of *anusvāra* above the letter *vē* was at first cut and may have been subsequently struck off in the original.  
⁵ This is as suggested by Hiralal, but he has not explained how the third case would be constructed with *matiḥ* that precedes. Read ![](rd32.JPG) : The reading of the last letter of the name that follows is uncertain, since it can also be read as *nya.*  
⁶ The first *akshara* of the name is indistinct and it was written after scratching off another which was engraved originally. Its reading by Hiralal is adopted here ; in fact the space shows that not one but two *aksharas* were engraved here.  
⁷ Read ![](rd33.JPG) , as already suggested by Hiralal.  
⁸ Read ![](rd34.JPG) . It may also be noted that *nāpita* and *dhīvara* are newly added here and *dūta* and vaidya occurring in the preceding inscriptions are dropped.  
⁹ The *akshara ma* is inadvertently repeated here.  
¹⁰ These corrections and additions are as suggested by Hiralal ; but the word *sahitaḥ* should be taken at the end of l. 12. No *sandhi* is made in this portion ; and the punctuation marks, as already stated above, are all redundant.  
¹¹ This is an abbreviation of *Ṭhakkura.*
