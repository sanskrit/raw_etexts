**AJAYGAḌH STONE INSCRIPTION OF THE TIME OF BHŌJAVARMAN**

(Undated)

THIS inscription was found by General Cunningham on a slab near the Ashṭa-Śakti image at the Tirhāwan Gate of the fort of **Ajaygaḍh** in the Pannā District of the Bundelkhand region of Madhya Pradesh.¹⁰ It was brought to notice by him in the *Archaeological Survey of India Reports,* Vol. XXI (1883-1885), pp. 47, 53 and 88 and Plate xv, and was subsequently edited by Dr. F. Kielhorn, with translation but without a facsimile, in the *Epigraphia Indica,* \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
  
¹ The *mātrā* of *nā* is mixed with the following one.  
² The *daṇḍa* is placed closer to the letter that follows it.  
³ The lower parts of the bracketed *aksharas* are lost.  
⁴ The letters in the brackets have peeled off and the reading of Srivastava is adopted here. While composing this verse the poet had in his mind the idea expressed in the *Naishadhīya-Charita,* I, 12, which compares Nala’s fame to a cloth-piece woven by his (or his warriors’) dexterity on the battlefield.  
⁵ The horizontal stroke of this *akshara* is faintly visible.  
⁶ Six or seven *aksharas,* which may have mentioned the *tithi,* the fortnight and the week day, are lost here.  
⁷ The letters in the brackets are damaged and have been adopted here from Srivastava’s transcript. But the meaning is not clear. Prinsep read ![](rd16.JPG).  
⁸ The second *mātrā* on this *akshara* is partly abraded and it is not known if that too was scored off in the original. The syllable *paṁ that* follows is a contraction of *Paṁḍita, i.e., Paṇḍit* ; its use in a *samāsa* cannot be grammatically defended. Perhaps we have also to read the two names as Ashan and Suhaḍa as they appear below in No. 193.  
⁹ The whole portion which is in brackets is incised in smaller letters which are not very clear in the impression and here I have adopted Prinsep’s readings as also done by Srivastava. The first seven *aksharas* are probably to be amended to ─ ![](rd17.JPG)  
¹⁰ For the situation of this place and its description, see above, No. 112.
