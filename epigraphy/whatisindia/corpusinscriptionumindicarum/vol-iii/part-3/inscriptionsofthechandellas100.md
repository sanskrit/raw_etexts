¹ Here, as in some cases below, the subscript of this letter is either faintly visible or is altogether missing. The emendations have all been made in view of this.  
² The lower portions of the last three letters were already lost in the time of C. As also noted by him, the sign of *anusvāra* may be accidental and the first two *aksharas* may be *Gāgē, Gāṅgē* or *Gāgū.* On the original, which I subsequently scrutinized, the reading is distinctly Gāṅgū.  
³ The bracketed letter is indistinct, and the traces show it to have been *Śrī,* as also suits the context.  
⁴ The *anusvāra* is doubtful. It is clear on the plate, as I noted in my examination subsequently.  
⁵ The *aksharas* in the brackets appear to be overwritten, as also noted by C.  
⁶ The letter is perhaps to be read with a subscript *r.* It is not known whether *iti* is intended here.  
⁷ The reading of the *mātrā* here is doubtful.  
⁸ This *akshara* contains some redundant strokes in its formation.  
⁹ The slanting stroke distinguishing this letter from *pa* is not formed.  
¹⁰ The Sanskrit word is Yaśōdēva.
