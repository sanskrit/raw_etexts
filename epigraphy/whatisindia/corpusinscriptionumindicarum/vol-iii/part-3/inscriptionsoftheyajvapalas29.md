^(\[1\]) From the original stone.  
^(\[2\]) Denoted by a symbol.  
^(\[3\]) What appears as the sign of *Anusvāra* above *ta* is the original fault of the stone.  
^(\[4\]) This may also be taken as ![](sn29.JPG):.  
^(\[5\]) In many cases this *akshara* appears as a combination of the palatal and the dental sibilant. At the end of the second line, as also at the end of some other lines below, the sign of *kāka-pāda* is engraved.  
^(\[6\]) By a redundant horizontal stroke, ga appears as ma. In contrast, see n. 9 below.  
^(\[7\]) In No. 178, below, the name appears as *Mahāruṇḍā.* Evidently the *mātrā* of the second letter of the name is here dropped as it would not suit the metre here.  
^(\[8\]) First engraved as ![](sn30.JPG), and then the stroke above the top of the second letter is scored off. *Avadāna* means ‘a glorious achievement’.  
^(\[9\]) The horizontal stroke of the consonant m is not engraved and thus it appears as g. cf. n. 5 above.  
^(\[10\]) Restore to ![](sn31.JPG) ─ meaning ‘who was dexterious in curbing the elephants of his enemies. lived on the hill.  
^(\[11\]) It can also be read as ![](sn32.JPG). The reading of the six bracketed letters that follow is from the traces left. The word *Chandra* here probably denotes Chandēlla (or Chandēri ?).  
^(\[12\]) *Sīmā* here gives the sense of ‘the end’, and īti means a distress, usually of six types as *ativṛishṭi, anāvṛishṭi,* etc.  
^(\[13\]) The reading of the bracketed *aksharas* is only from the faint traces on the stone and therefore uncertain. Sircar read ![](sn33.JPG).
