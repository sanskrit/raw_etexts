**INSCRIPTIONS OF THE CHANDELLAS OF JEJAKABHUKTI**

No . 109: PLATE CI

DARBAT ŚĀNTINĀTHA IMAGE INSCRIPTION OF THE TIME OF KĪRTTIVARMAN

\[Vikrama\] Year 1132

THIS inscription, which is engraved on the pedestal of statue, was discovered in the village of Darbat,¹ near Mahōbā in the Hamīrpur District of Uttar Pradesh, in 1935, and was presented to the State Museum, Lucknow, by the Commissioner of the Jhānsī Division. It is No G. 308 of the Acquisition Register of the Museum. The record was noticed by Dr. N. P. Chakravarti, then Government Epigraphist for India, who gave a brief description of it in the *Annual Report of the Archaeological Survey of India,* 1936- 7, p. 92. His description of the inscription runs in the following words :

“ It is found on a marble frieze containing a sitting lion on each side. Apparently the statue once set up has now disappeared. The whole record is in three parts. The one to the left records that the image of Śāntinātha was caused to be made by the merchants Pāhila and Jījū. that in the middle mentions *Paṇḍitāchārya* Vāsavachandra and the inscription on the right says that the image was set up by Kīrttidhara in Saṁvat 1132 in the reign of the illustrious Vijayapāla. This ruler is most probably to be identified with the father of Vikramasiṁha of the Dubkund branch of the Kachchhapaghāta family for whom we have a record of V. 1145. The Vijayādhirāja of the Bayānā Jaina inscription of V. 1100 has been identified with this Vijayapāla. But if he is a prince of the Sūrasena family whose inscriptions have been found in Bharatpur State, as he seems to be, then the present inscription would be the only record so far known of the Kachchhapaghāta Vijayapāla”.

Dr. Chakravarti had also prepared impressions of this record in his visit to the Provincial Museum, Lucknow : and from a study of these impressions, lying in his office since then, Dr. D. C. Sircar, then Government Epigraphist for India, published a note in the *Indian Historical Quarterly,* Volume XXX, pp 183-85, with a transcript and a photograph of the inscription. In this article be rightly observes that “Dr. Chakravarti does not appear to have taken note of the findspot of the inscription.” Sircar goes on state that since in the eleventh century A.C. to which time the record belongs Mahōbā was one of the strongholds of the Chandēlla kings, it should be ascribed to this dynasty and not to that of the Kachchhapoghātas.² More in this respect will be said in its proper place, after giving the preliminary details of the document.

As stated above, the inscription contains **three sections :** the portion on the left middle, and right, called here Sections ^(A, B) and ,^(C,) each of which contains two lines of writing. The letters are not very carefully formed and a few of them are also damaged in Section ^(C,) but the text of the record can be completely restored . The ^(writing) belongs to the eleventh century A.C. Attention may here be drawn to the formation of *ṇ* in *paṇḍita* in ^(B,) l. 1, of which the lowest extremity is just a stroke, of *t* which is devoid of its tail of the left limb, as in *praṇamati,* in ^(B,) l. 2. and of *r* which is denoted by a vertical with a horizontal or a slating stroke attached to it on the left, as in *rūpaṁ* and *srēyaskaraṁ,* both in ^(A,) l. 1 . The cursive way of writing *ktyā* in ^(A,) l. 2, is noteworthy and in *paṇḍitāchārya* in ^(B,) l.1 *ch* appears as *d.*

The **language** of the record is Sanskrit : and whereas Section B is wholly in prose, Sections **A,** and **C** have one verse each in the *Anushṭubh* metre, the latter also embodying the word *Saṁvat* in the end, in prose. **Orthographical peculiarities** are the same as to be found in the inscriptions of the time, *e.g.,* the use of the dental for the palatal sibilant, as in *srēyaskaraṁ* and *Sāṁtēḥ,* in **A,** l.1, which also illustrate the use of an *anusvāra* for a class-nasal, and the reduplication of a consonant following *r,* as in *Sāṁtēr-vvāsava* in **A** l. 1, but not in *paṇḍitāchārya* in B l. 1. A grammatical error occurs in the use of *pratishṭi (ṭhi)tā* for *pratishṭhāpitā* in **C,** l. 2.

The inscription is **sectarian ;** and its **object** is to record the setting up of an image – evidently the one which is now lost, of Śānti. i.e., the Jaina Tirthaṅkara Śāntinātha, in **V.S. 1132, corresponding to 1075 A.C.** The details of the year are not recorded.
