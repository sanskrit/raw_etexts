**INSCRIPTIONS OF THE CHANDELLAS OF JEJAKABHUKTI**

Paramardin. All these circumstances show that probably the plate was obtained by the dealer somewhere round about Jhānsī. And lastly, **Pāṭalīputra-nagara,** which is stated here to have been the original place of the donee (l. 11), is evidently the city of Patnā in Bihar. It may be noted that here it is called a nagara (city) and not a bhaṭṭāgrahāra, as in another grant of the same king.¹ And this statement may probably be taken to suggest that a rent-free locality of Brāhmaṇas existed side by side with the city of that name during that period.

¹ No. 138, l. 10.  
² From the original plate and an impression.  
³ Expressed by a symbol.  
⁴ The consonant of the second letter of the name is formed as lingual *ḍ* (round-backed), but the dental *d* is probably intended here as we find in the name appearing in some of the grants of this house.  
⁵ The consonants of the first and the second letter of the name can each be read either as *ch* or *v,* but I prefer to take it as the former, as the place being so called is situated in the territorial division in which it is mentioned here. See under identification of place-names in the article.  
⁶ Originally engraved as *dayi,* with the curve of the *mātrā* scratched off. The *ṭa* of *chāṭa* that follows was also originally engraved as ḍa and corrected later on.  
⁷ The bracketed *akshara* is not well engraved, and the *v* of *vi* that follows has a redundant stroke in it.  
⁸ Drop the *daṇḍa* and read![](ns601.JPG). Cf. No. 119 (11. 16-17) and No. 138 (11. 10-11) where these three *pravaras* are grouped together.  
⁹ This and the other *daṇḍas* in this line are intended to show, as in the Sēmrā and some other grants of this king, that the letter preceding it is a contraction of the word denoting a surname, as *Ṭha* of *Ṭhakkura.*  
¹⁰ This is a contraction of *Paṁḍita i.e., Paṇḍit.*
