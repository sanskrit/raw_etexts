**SUPPLEMENTARY INSCRIPTIONS**

sprung from Kāśyapa and belonging to (in charge of) the gateways of Jayapura and Kālañjara. The names of Suhaḍadēva and his wife Dēvalladēvī are also written in the part on the left-hand side. The inscription is **dated** in the (Vikrama) **year 1366, on Thursday, the 10th of the bright half of Śrāvaṇa,** which, as calculated by Chakravarti, is equivalent to **17th July, 1309 A.D.** Thus we know that these images were carved nearly 22 years later than those mentioned in the preceding and the following inscriptions which are dated in 1344 and 134x A.C., respectively, by the same Suhaḍadēva and his wife Dēvalladēvī, about whom we have said in our editions of them.

The block on which the present inscription was found must have originally belonged to **Ajaygaḍh,** as is indicated by its contents, and seems to have been brought to Pannā, some time in the past. The record does not give the name of any reigning king ; but from the year mentioned in it, we may well conclude that it undoubtedly belonged to the time of the Chandēlla king **Hammīravarman** who was on the throne from 1289-90 to about 1309 A.C. when the Muslim armies were overrunning Bundelkhaṇḍ. Thus it is clear from the present record that though a great part of the Chandēlla territories was then occupied by Alā-ud-dīn, at least the fort of Ajaygaḍh was in possession of the Chandēlla Hammīravarman in whose reign the images were engraved.

The **geographical places** mentioned in the inscription, namely, **Kālañjara** and **Jayapura,** have already been identified. The latter of these in Ajaygaḍh itself.
