**BAMHNĪ SATĪ STONE INSCRIPTION**

\[ Vikrama \] Year 1365

THIS inscription was first brought to notice in 1923-24, by Rai Bahadur Hiralal in his edition of the Mahōbā grant of the Chandēlla king Paramardin, which was published in the *Epigraphia Indica,* Vol. XVI, pp. 9 ff. He published a rough transcript of the text of the record in a foot-note on p. 10 of it, and subsequently, also noticed its contents, in brief, in his *Inscriptions in the Central Provinces and Berar*.¹⁰ The record is edited here for the first time from inked impressions kindly supplied to me, at my request, by the Superintending Archaeologist, Central Circle, Bhopal, who got them prepared recently by his technical assistant.

The inscription is incised on a slab discovered in the village **Bamhnī** situated about 35 kms. north-northwest of Haṭṭā, the headquarters of a *tehsī*l in the Damōh District of Madhya Pradesh.¹¹ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
¹ Hiralal is perhaps right in proposing the omission of the prefix *pra.* The text is corrupt here. The name that follows was read by him as *Saṭhēla,* but the second letter thereof looks as resembling *hi,* the upper curve of the *mātrā* being not marked as in many other cases.  
² Hiralal suggests the addition of *ubhādhyāṁ* here and it may be adopted.  
³ Seven *aksharas* are illegible here. Hiralal read the last three as (Sanskrit), but the traces show them to be (Sanskrit):.  
⁴ The reading is only tentative. The second, fourth, sixth and eighth *aksharas* of this line cannot be clearly made out and possibly some villages marking the boundaries are mentioned here.  
⁵ The repetition of iti is unnecessary here. The vowel *i* is shown here by two horizontal strokes.  
⁶ As to be read from the traces left.  
⁷ The vertical strokes are probably hidden below the strap fastened to the end of the plate.  
⁸ Both the bracketed letters are highly corroded.  
⁹ One *akshara* appears to have been at first engraved at the end of the line and then scratched off. Consequently the writer’s name is not completely known.  
¹⁰ *Second edn.,* p. 57. It is also stated here that the inscription is also noticed or referred to in the *Proceedings* of the 4th Oriental Conference held at Allahabad, Vol. I ; but I was unable to find this reference in this Vol. Similarly, I failed to find the record edited in the *Ep. Ind.,* Vol. XIX, p. 30, as stated by Dr. S. K. Mitra in his *Early Rulers of Khajurāhō* (1958), p. 239, No. 64.  
¹¹ Shri L. P. Jain, Tehsildar at Haṭṭā, informs me that the village Bamhnī is about 10 kms. by country track, either from Sāgonī or from Ghaṭērā, both stations on the Bīnā-Katnī line of the Central Railway. It is interesting to note here that the place is about 15 kms. south of Dāhī and almost double the distance due east of Sēmrā, the find-place of the other two Chandēlla grants.
