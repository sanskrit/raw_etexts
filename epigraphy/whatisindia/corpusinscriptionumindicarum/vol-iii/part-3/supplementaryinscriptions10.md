**SUPPLEMENTARY INSCRIPTIONS**

No. 182 ; PLATE CXLVII  
**DABHOKA STONE INSCRIPTION OF THE TIME OF NARAVARMAN**  
( Undated )

THIS inscription was discovered by the Superintendant of Archaeology, Mēwāḍ, at **Dabhōka** a village situated about 18 kms. to the east of Udaipur, formerly the capital of a State of the same name and now the headquarters of a district, in Rājasthān. The inscribed stone was subsequently removed to the Archaeological Museum at Udaipur, where it is now exhibited.

The record was noticed by N. P. Chakravarti, in the *Annual Report* of the Archaeological Survey of India, under Epigraphy, for 1936-37, on p. 124. In his notice, he observed that the stone was found fixed in a small platform built round the worship stone known as Rāḍāji.

The inscription consists of 20 lines of writing, and measures 24 cms. broad by 31 cms. high. It is in a very bad state of preservation. Besides a few letters which have completely disappeared in the middle of ll. 9-12, the stone has lost a portion at the top of the right side, and also at the lower left corner, measuring about 11 cms. long. Moreover, very few of the letters that now remain are completely decipherable, and most of the syllables are partly or wholly worn away. However, from a set of impressions prepared by the technical Assistant of the Western Circle of the Survey and with my gratitude to the authorities of the Museum for kindly according permission for the same, a general idea of the contents of the inscription is given below.

The **alphabet** is Nāgarī and the **language** is Sanskrit. The **object** of the inscription appears to mention the building of two Śaiva temples, probably by Mahīpati (l. 12), who belonged to the Kāyastha family and was probably a son of one Rudrāditya, who is mentioned as a pre-eminent Kāyastha (*Kāuastha-kuñjara*), in l. 9. The inscription appears to belong to the reign of the (Paramāra) king **Naravarman,** whose name is mentioned in l. 7. By way of the genealogy of the house, the record gives the names of **Sindhurāja Bhōjadēva,** and **Udayāditya** respectively in ll. 4, 5 and 6. The portion containing the description of each of these rulers cannot be fully made out, and equally so the relationship of each of them with his predecessor, which, of course, is otherwise well known. The names of Jayasiṁha and Lakshmivarman are, however, omitted.

The extent portion of the inscription does not bear any date, nor any geographical name is mentioned therein. The information supplied by the record is very meagre, but it undoubtedly indicates that the Paramāra kingdom continued to extend up to Udaipur during the days of Naravarman.^(\[1\])

**HOSHANGĀBĀD HERO STONE INSCRIPTION OF THE TIME OF THE MAHAKUMĀRA HARIŚCHANDRA**  
\[ Vikrama \] Year 1243

THIS inscription was found by Shri Jagadish Dube, a lecturer in the Government Intermediate College at Hardē in the Hoshangābād District, who intimated this discovery to me in 1972, also providing me with an eye-copy of it. Almost at the same time, a note on the record was contributed to the Session of the All-India Oriental Conference held at Ujjain in December 1972, by Dr. Haladhar Pathak, Professor in the Home Science College at Hoshanga-
