No. 161 ; PLATE CXXXXVIII  
**BAḌŌDĪ STONE INSCRIPTION OF THE TIME OF GŌPĀLADEVA**  
\[Vikrama\] Year 1336

THE stone bearing this inscription was discovered in 1922, by M. B. Garde, who was then the Superintendent of the Archaeology department in the former State of Gwālior, now integrated with Madhya Pradesh. It was found lying on a hill near the village of **Baḍōḍi,** a petty hamlet not far from Narwar in the Karērā *parganā* of the Shivpurī District, and was removed to the archaeological museum at Gwālior, where it is now exhibited. The inscription was noticed by Garde himself in the *Annual Report* of the Department for V.S. 1979 (1922-23 A.C.), as No. 26, ^(\[7\]) and also in the *Annual Reports of the Archaeological Survey of India,* for the same year, on p. 187. Subsequently, it was edited by Dr. D. C. Sircar, with text in the

¹ There is a play on the words *śuchi* and *syāma,* which, besides their meaning ‘pious’ and the name ‘Śyāma’, as applicable here, convey the sense of white and black, and respectively show a contrast. For the mention of śyāma *(vaṭa)* in literary, works, see reference given in *Ep. Ind., Vol. XXXIII,* p. 67, n. 2.  
^(\[2\]) The *akshara* in the brackets is conjecturally restored.  
^(\[3\]) Th intended reading may have been –*śīlāyaṁ.* What look like *anusvāras* on some letters in this line are due to scratches on the stone.  
^(\[4\]) Probably *kuśāgra-dhīḥ* is intended.  
^(\[5\]) The word appears to denote Gōpāladēva, as mentioned above.  
^(\[6\]) Sircar read the last letter as *ḥṛi,* but on the stone it is clear as taken here. The rest of the *praśasti* was not engraved although there is enough space below on the stone.  
^(\[7\]) Unfortunately, this report is not available as it was not printed. The reference here is from H. N. Dvivedi’s *Gwālior Rājya kē Abhilēkh,* a Hindi publication of the same department, Nos. 132.
