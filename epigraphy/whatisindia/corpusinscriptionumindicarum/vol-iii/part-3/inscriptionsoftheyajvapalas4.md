 The last section, which commences with v. 65, expresses the hope that as long as the splendour of the sky is adorned by the moon, the Sun and the stars resembling a string of pearls, ─ even so long may the temple last.

 The next two verses furnish the details about the poet who composed the praśasti. He was the illustrious Dēvachandra, a disciple of Vīrēndra, or Vīrachandra, who was known as the moving goddess of Leaning and who again was a disciple of Dēvagupta of the Śvētāmbara clan who is stated to have delighted the king or kings (whose name or names is / are not mentioned). Lastly, we are informed that the praśasti was written by Vēdē, the son of Śarad,^(\[1\]) a Kāyastha of the Vāstavya clan, and was engraved by Āmadēva, the son of the artisan Pāpaka of the Kāśyapa gōtra. In the last line we read the names of Udaï, the son of Lakshmī, who belonged to the Māthura clan (of the Kāyasthas) : but the connection in which this name appears here is not stated in the inscription.

 Of the **localities** mentioned in the present inscription, **Nalapura** (l. 10), the capital of the royal house of the Yajvapālas, is evidently the modern town of Narwar in the Shivpurī District of Madhya Pradesh ; and the *vishaya* of **Pādōnalaksha,** in which it is stated to have been situated (l. 9), is obviously the surrounding region. **Palāsavāha,** where the temple was erected (l. 22), cannot be identified ; but from the provenance of the inscription, it is possible to suggest that this may have been the ancient name of Bhimpur itself, the details of which have already been mentioned above.
