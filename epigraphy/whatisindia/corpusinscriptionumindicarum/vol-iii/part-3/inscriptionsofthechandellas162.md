No. 144 ; PLATE CXXXI

**CHARKHĀRĪ COPPER-PLATE INSCRIPTION OF VĪRAVARMAN**

\[Vikrama\] Year 1311

THIS inscription, which is on a copper-plate, was edited along with three others,¹⁰ by R. B. Hiralal, in the *Epigraphia Indica,* Vol XX (1929-30), pp. 132 f., without a facsimile. The plates bearing all these inscriptions are reported to have been possessed by the Chief of the former State of **Charkhārī,** now a *tehsīl* in the Hamīrpur District of Uttar Pradesh, but there is no information as to their original find-spot or regarding the circumstances under which they were found. Hiralal’s edition of the present inscription is not accompanied with a facsimile, as also of those of the other three edited along with it ; and as an impression too of it is not now forthcoming, I edit the record here from his transcript, adding my notes to it.

As said above, it is a **single copper-plate wh**ich is stated to measure as equal to 38.5 cms. by 28.9 cms, with its rim raised to the height of about .5 cm. and rivetted with nails all round. It is inscribed on one side only and the inscription consists of 19 lines of writing. It weighs 2 kgms. and 689 grams. In the middle of the upper part of it, there is a hole, apparently made for a ring, which, with any seal if it was ever attached to it, is not forthcoming ; and thus it appears more likely that the hole was made not to join it with a second plate but (subsequently by the owner) to string the plate with some other plates, since the inscription on it is complete in itself. In the middle of the first six lines the writing is interrupted by a representation of the goddess **Lakshmī,** holding a lotus flower in each of the two upper hands and water-pots in the two lower hands, The letters are stated to have been well formed, showing an average size of .5 cm.

¹ The *daṇḍas* are superfluous.  
² The *akshara* ![](nexus2.JPG) is written above the line.  
³ As remarked by Mirashi, the text is corrupt here and what is intended appears to be ![](nexus3.JPG).  
⁴ This contraction cannot be explained. It probably denotes ![](nexus4.JPG)  
⁵ Probably a letter has disappeared at the beginning of this line, as shown by a trace.  
⁶ The text is again corrupt here. Probably![](nexus5.JPG) is meant.  
⁷ Read ![](nexus6.JPG).  
⁸ For ![](nexus7.JPG).  
⁹ An ornamental design appears between the double *daṇḍas.*  
¹⁰ For the other three inscriptions, see above, Nos. 108, 132 and 151.
