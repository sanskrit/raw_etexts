**INSCRIPTIONS OF THE CHANDELLAS OF JEJAKABHUKTI**

such a way as to be easily confounded with the sign for medial *ā or ē,* and these strokes also are often put to separate the names as in ll. 20-21. *Sandhis* are violated in showing the *gōtras etc.,* in ll. 16-17 and, on the other hand, the *visarga* at the end of v. 11 is changed to r in view of the following i.

The record belongs to the king **Madanavarman** of the **Chandēlla Dynasty** and the lord of Kālañjara and gives the details of some of plots of land granted by him to learned Brāhmaṇas from his camp at Parēyī-grāma. The date is mentioned to be **Tuesday, the fifth of the darh half of Chaitra** in the (Vikrama) year **1192** on the **Vishuvat saṁkrānti.** The date, as calculated by Dr. Sircar, corresponds to **24th of March, 1136 A.C.,** if the month is regarded *amānta.*^(\[1\]) The charter was drafted by the *dharmalēkhin* (writer of legal documents) **Sūḍha** of the Vāstavya family, by the order of king ( v.12) and he also wrote it on the plates. It was engraved by **Ulhaṇa**^(\[2\]) who belonged to the brazier *(rītikāra)* family (v.13).

Opening with an auspicious symbol followed by the customary verse in praise of the Chandrātrēya (Chandēlla) family, the record mentions the name of the *Parama-bhaṭṭāraka, Mahārājādhirāja and Paramēśvara,* the illustrious **Madanavarman,** the lord of Kālañjara, who meditated on the feet of the illustrious P.M.P. **Pṛithvīvarman** who, in his turn, had meditated on the feet the *P.M.P.,* the illustrious **Kīrttivarman.** This portion of the text is copied verbatim from the Augāsī great issued only a couple of years before. Then we have two new stanzas lavishing praise on the donor, the first of which states that the creator with his ripe knowledge and incessant practice endowed Madanavarman with good qualities such as handsomeness, profundity, might, wisdom and truthfulness, and the second that his liberality put the wish-filling trees on the golden mountain with their bent tops appearing as if they turned their faces to the ground due to shame. Then begins the formal part of the record which states that from his camp at the aforementioned Parēyī-grāma the king bestowed 2¼ pādas of land in **Valahauḍā-grāma** in the *vishaya* of **Mahisiṇēha** on the Brāhmaṇa. Paṇḍita Sōmēśarman of the Kautsa gōtra, with the three *pravaras* Āṅgirasa, Ambarīsha and Yauvanāśva. He is stated to be the son of the *Ṭhakkura* Śrī-Śrīpāla, grandson of the *Dvivēda* Sahāraṇa and great-grandson of the *Avasathin* Dēvaṭa(?)^(\[3\]) and his family hailed from the *Bhaṭṭagrahāra* of Pāṭaliputra.

This portion of the charter is following by the donation of two other plots of land, by the king, in favour of one each of the two Brāhmaṇas, in lieu of those which they had in their possession. This change was made apparently for the sake of convenience. The first of these two Brāhmaṇas was Dīkshita Nārāyaṇaśarman of the Gautama *gōtra* with the Gautama, Āṅgirasa and Āyāsya pravaras. He was the son of Dīkshita Dēvēndra, grandson of Dīkshita Vāmana svāmin and great-grandson of Dīkshita Kēśava, and his family had hailed from the *Bhaṭṭāgrahāra* of Paṇikabhadra. It is stated that instead of the land he possessed in the villages of **Pipalahā** in the **Tintiri-pattalā, Vasauhā** in the **Kōlavā-pattalā, Goulā** in the **Vāndiuri-pattalā, Dādarī** in the **Navaraṭha-pattalā** and **Dēnavaḍā** in the **Mahisiṇēha-pattalā,** the king granted him four *pādas* of land in exchange for **Astavāla-grāma** in **Tintiri-pattalā** as well as his land in **Valahauḍā-grāma in Mahisiṇēha-pattalā** and **Ḍāvaha** (or **Ḍavēha)-gramā in Nandāvaṇa** (or **Nandavēṇa**)^(\[4\])-**pattalā** which he had received respectively from Nādūka (or Nādūki ?), the priest attached to the queen Lakhamīdēvī, and Sōmēka, son of *Ṭhakkura Śrī*-Śripala.

The third donee was the Brāhmaṇa Sahajūśarman who was a brother of Sōmēśarman, mentioned above, as we know from his details given in the charter. He received 1¾ *pādas* of land in exchange of that which he possessed in the **Pipalahā-gramā** in the **Tintiri-pattala** and

^(\[1\]) *Ep. Ind.,* Vol. XXXII, p. 119. The year was Kārttikadi *expired.*  
^(\[2\]) This person also engraved the Augāsī charter of the same king. In that great the second akshara of the name is distinctly lha, as also read by Kielhorn who edited it. In the present inscription, however, ha is clear and the upper part of what precedes it is bent to the right, showing that it was intended to be l and not the medial ē-sign as taken by Sircar who read the name *Ūhēṇa.* The name can be read definitely by a comparison of these letters in both the plates.  
^(\[3\]) For the reading of the third letter of the name, see n. in the text, below.  
^(\[4\]) In view of the fact that this name is distinct as *Nandāvaṇa* in the Ichchhāvar grant, we must take it to be correct and not the one in the brackets, the confusion being caused by the vertical stroke which is detached from both the *aksharas* before and after it. This inscription contains a number of errors of this type.
