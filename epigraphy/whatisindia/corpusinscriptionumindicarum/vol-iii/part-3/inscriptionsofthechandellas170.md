**INSCRIPTIONS OF THE CHANDELLAS OF JEJAKABHUKTI**

**AJAYGAḌH ROCK INSCRIPTION OF THE TIME OF VĪRAVARMAN**

No. 146 ; PLATE CXXXIII

**AJAYGAḌH ROCK INSCRIPTION OF THE TIME OF VĪRAVARMAN**

\[Vikrama\] Year 1325

This inscription is incised on a wall of a temple in the fort of **Ajaygaḍh** in the Pannā District of the Vindhya region of Madhya Pradesh. It was first noticed by Alexander Cunningham in 1884-85, and he also transcribed and translated the record in his *Archaeological Survey of India Reports,* Vol. XXI, p. 51 and plate xiv-F. It is edited here from the same plate.

The record contains three lines, the last of which is slightly longer than the other two. The characters are Nāgarī of the thirteenth century A.C., to which the record belongs. But they are very badly formed, for example, the letter *ṇa in praṇamati* (l.2), *tsa in vatsa* and *r* in *–rājē* (both in l.3), can be recognised only by the context. **Palaeographically,** the two forms of the initial vowel *a*, one in *asva* and other in *abhaya,* both in l∙ l, go to indicate that this letter was in a transitional stage. The initial short *i,* which is the fore-runner of its modern form, shows its loop and the tail as a hook; see *Iśvara* in l. 2. S the first member of a conjunct consonant *sva* in l. 1 and 2, begins with a loop as of *ś.* As regards **orthography,** what is worth noting is that the consonant following *r* is doubled in *–varmma-,* in l. 3.¹

The **language** of the inscription is Sanskrit, which is full of grammatical and other errors. The sign of a *visarga* of the nominative singular form in *putra,* l.1, and *Abhayadēva,* and *i(ī)śvara,* both in l.2, have not been engraved, and in *saṁvat,* l. 3, the final consonant is not marked. In this word the palatal sibilant is also used for the dental. Errors in technical execution are in *Vīravvarmarājē* for the correct *Vīravarmmarājyē,* in l. 3.

The **object** of the inscription is to record the adoration of one Abhayadēva of the Vatsa *gōtra,* who was a son of *Ṭha (Ṭhakkura)* Bhōjaka, who was expert in curing horse diseases, in the reign of **Vīravarman,** whose genealogy is not mentioned but who was evidently the **Chandēlla** king ruling in the country around Ajayagaḍh from c. 1247 to 1286 A.C. The record is **dated** only in figures *i.e.,* (V.) **S. 1325** or **1268 A.C.** For want of details the exact date cannot be worked out.

The name of the Bhōjūka figures in the Ajaygaḍh stone inscription of Vīravarman’s successor, Bhōjavarman.² It is possible to identify the Bhōjaka of our record with this Bhōjūka, and the calculation of the time of both these persons would favour this view. But in the absence of any definite evidence on this point, nothing can be said with certainty.

³ From Pl. xiv-F in Cunningham’s *A. S. I. R.,* Vol. XXI.  
⁴ Expressed by a symbol.  
⁵ The two strokes following the symbol probably represent the punctuation mark.  
⁶ The letter *Ṭha* is an abbreviation for *Ṭhakura.* The reading of *ja* is not certain.  
⁷ The syllable in the brackets is not well formed.  
⁸ The letter in the brackets is badly incised ; and the *daṇḍa* in the end is endowed with a top-stroke which is combined with that of the preceding one.
