**INSCRIPTIONS OF THE CHANDELLAS OF JEJAKABHUKTI**

vīrāja in 1184 A.C. That he continued to maintain his dignity and the glory of the house even subsequent to this reverse is shown by v. 10 of the Baṭēśvara stone inscription and thereafter, by the present record, dated in V. 1258 or 1201 A.C. It is, however, curious, as already noted by Cunningham, that just 18 months after the present inscription was composed, Paramardin had to surrender the fort to the Muslims, on 27th April, 1203 A.C.¹

The only **geographical name** of importance mentioned in the inscription is that of **Daśārṇa,** Two countries are known by this name : the Western Daśārṇa comprised Eastern Mālava, including Bhōpāl, and the Eastern Daśārṇa signified a part of Chhattisgaḍh.² Following this clue the name appears to have been used here to denote both the territories roughly forming the region of the Western Vindhyas.

¹ N. L. Dey, *G. D. A. M. I.,* p. 54.  
² *A. S. I. R.,* Vol. XXI, p. 38.  
³ Lines 1-18 from an impression, and the rest from transcript by Maisey in *J. A. S. B.,* Vol. XVII, pp. 313 ff.  
⁴ It is not known if the symbol for *Siddham* was engraved in the beginning, as the portion is lost. Metre of this and of verses 2, 6, 8-11, 14-16 and 18-19 ; *Sragdharā.*  
⁵ The *daṇḍa* has almost mingled with the vertical of the preceding *akshara.*  
⁶ Maisey read ![](nitro22.JPG), but the sign of the secondary *ī* with the consonant *l* is distinct in the impression. It means ‘false or feigned’ and has to be taken as governing the next word.  
⁷ Metre of this and of vv. 4-5, 7, 12-13 and 17 : *Śārdūlavikrīḍita.*  
⁸ The reading of this letter is uncertain, as it is mutilated.  
⁹ These letters, which are indistinct in the impression, have been adopted from Maisey’s reading, but they appear to be incorrect, particularly the first of the *aksharas.*  
¹⁰ Maisey read here ![](nitro23.JPG), and he has not marked the *daṇḍa,* which is clear in the impression.
