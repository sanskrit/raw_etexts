**INSCRIPTIONS OF THE CHANDELLAS OF JEJAKABHUKTI**

He was a son of the *Ṭhakkura* Rālhaṇa and a grandson of the Dīkshita Pṛithvīdhara. This shows that the family names were not stereotyped in the locality in the twelfth century A.C. as also in Mālavā, as we have so often seen.

The last line of the record mentions the date, only in figures. It is **Sunday, the ninth day of the dark half of** Jyēshṭha of the (Vikrama) year 1192, which regularly corresponds to **Sunday, the 26th April, 1136 A.C.** for the Southern (Kārttikādi) expired year and the Pūrṇimanta month.^(\[1\])

The record below also consists of four lines which are in bigger letters and written in a different hand. These letters do not show ornamentations in their top-strokes, as noted above. But here the noteworthy is the form of r as in *Rālhaṇa* in l. 2.

No. 121 ; PLATE CXI-B  
**AJAYGAḌH STONE INSCRIPTION OF THE TIME OF MADANAVARMAN**  
\[ Vikrama \] Year 1208

THIS inscription is incised on a jamb of the Upper Gate of the fort of **Ajayagaḍh**^(\[11\]) the chief town of a *tehsīl* in the Pannā District of the Vindhya region of Madhya Pradesh. The record was discovered by General Cunningham in 1883-84, and he noticed it, with his own reading of the text and a rough translation thereof, in his *Archaeological Survey of India Reports,* Vol. XXI, p. 49 and Plate xii-A. From the same plate it is edited here.

^(\[2\]) From Plate x-D in Cunningham’s A. S. I. R., Vol. XXI.  
^(\[3\]) Expressed by symbol.  
^(\[4\]) Cunningham read the consonant of this akshara as s, but on the plate is clear as taken here. He has however, corrected the reading of the preceding title Thakkura which was misread as Sarkkāra by the editor of the Bengal Asiatic Society’s Journal. See his A. S. I. R., Vol. XXI, p. 35, n.  
^(\[5\]) In the J. A. S. B. these aksharas are read as ![](jen20.JPG). and Cunningham read them as parava  
^(\[6\]) The letters in the brackets are mutilated. Read ![](jen21.JPG).  
^(\[7\]) For ![](jen22.JPG).  
^(\[8\]) Cunningham read this word as sudi, but I find the first akshara very distinct as taken here. Also see Ind. Ant., Vol. XIX, p. 178, No. 125.  
^(\[9\]) Expressed by symbol.  
^(\[10\]) As n. 6 above.  
^(\[11\]) The antiquites of this place are described by Cunningham in his A. S. I. R., Vol. XXI, pp. 46 ff.
