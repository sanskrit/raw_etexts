No. 187 ; PLATE CLXIII  
GIRVAD STONE INSCRIPTION  
\[Vikrama\] Year 1181

THE stone slab bearing this inscription is built into a side-wall of the *maṇḍapa* of the Pāṭanārāyaṇa temple at **Girvad**^(\[11\]), a tiny hamlet about 16kms, west of Ābū Road, the principal town of a *tehsīl* in the Sirōhī District, Rājasthān. The record was briefly noticed by D. R. Bhandarkar in the *Progress Report of the Western Circle,* 1906-07, p. 27 ; ^(\[12\]) and it is edited here, for the first time, from time, from personal examination and from an impression prepared under my guidance, by N. M. Ganam, the Technical Assistance of the Western Circle of the Archaeological Survey of India.

^(\[1\]) From the original stone. Subsequently, I have also compared my reading from facsimile facing o. 35 of *Ep, Ind.,* Vol. XXXVIII. The inscription begins with a symbol which is partly mutilated.  
^(\[2\]) Here supply ![](srs46.JPG) or ![](srs47.JPG) or, as suggested by Ramsharma. ![](srs48.JPG), but on the original it appears, as taken here, at the beginning of the third line.  
^(\[3\]) The reading of the bracketed *aksharas* is based on those ending the name of a village which exists in the neighbourhood even to-day. The *mātrā* of the first of them appears to be mixed with the slanting stroke of the second. On the original the last two syllables appears as ![](srs49.JPG).  
^(\[4\]) This *akshara* is followed by two hollow circles and a horizontal stroke, and the reading of them, as adopted here, is doubtful. Ramsharma read the fourth and the fifth letters in this line as ![](srs50.JPG).  
^(\[5\]) This *akshara* is de-formed, and the mātrā on the preceding ![](srs51.JPG) resembles a curve.  
^(\[6\]) Two or three *aksharas* are lost at the end of the line and the reading ![](srs52.JPG) is adopted here from that of Ramsharma ; but the reading is not certain, as the last of the *aksharas* appears as a conjunct.  
^(\[7\]) Read ![](srs53.JPG) Possibly, what is intended is ![](srs54.JPG).  
^(\[8\]) Two or three *aksharas* are lost here also.  
^(\[9\]) Some letters are indistinct here, and some lost at the end. Ramsharma read them as ![](srs55.JPG) He also took ![](srs56.JPG) engraved for ![](srs57.JPG) but I do not find the reading certain.  
^(\[10\]) Eight *aksharas* are lost here and they were read by Ramsharma as ![](srs58.JPG) with some doubt from an impression prepared in 1961-62.  
^(\[11\]) The temple is about 3 kms, south of the village known as Chandēla which is connected with Ābū Road by a metalled road. The present inscription just faces the one edited above under No. 82.  
^(\[12\]) Also see *A. S. I. P. R. W. C.* 1916-17, recording some more antiquities at that place.
