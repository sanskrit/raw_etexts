\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
^(\[1\]) What appears to have been intended is *kṛiśānavē tōvam.* The punctuation mark is redundant.  
^(\[2\]) What seems as the sign of *anusvāra* on *ra* in the impression is due to the fault of the plate, as seen from the original.  
^(\[3\]) This verb goes with *mātā* in line 4, which, however, cannot grammatically be connected with the word Satyabhāmā nor also with tayā. Moreover, after this verb, one expects an expression like *yathā.*  
^(\[4\]) That is, *Ṭhakkura.* The next *akshara* may also have been a misformed ja and thus its reading is not certain. Most of the names and some other words in this and the following lines are without case-endings and are also unnecessarily separated by punctuation marks. The corrections are not made every time lest the number of foot-notes should increase. The first *akshara* of the name is blurred and also seems as *ma.* It may also be noted that in the following lines some details with reference to the donees are dropped, and in some instances, nothing besides the names is found, as already stated.  
^(\[5\]) The numeral 3 probably represents the pravaras, or it may have been a misformed ya, as required here.  
^(\[6\]) The consonant of the first *akshara* of the name of the place may also be read as r or v.  
^(\[7\]) All the *aksharas* of the name after tathā are blurred and their reading is uncertain.  
^(\[8\]) Grammatically it is incorrect.  
^(\[9\]) From the construction it is not possible to know anything about the names of the brothers, here and in some cases below. Perhaps Nimvāka and his brothers (?).  
^(\[10\]) An arrow-mark above this *akshara* probably indicates that the line in the left margin has to be supplied here, but the corresponding mark is not engraved.  
^(\[11\]) The consonant of the preceding *akshara* appears as l.  
^(\[12\]) The reading of the bracketed *akshara* is doubtful, and it is not known whether the *mātrā* of the third *akshara* of the name is of ē. One naturally expects the name of the village here.  
^(\[13\]) In this line, and also in some others below, the use of both the words *pada* and padaka occurs side by side.  
^(\[14\]) This *gōtra* seems to refer to those mentioned previously. The letter tra is also written as tira in this line.
