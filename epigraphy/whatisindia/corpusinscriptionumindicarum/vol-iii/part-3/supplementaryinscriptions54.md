\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
^(\[1\]) After an indistinct *akshara* following *tathā,* a portion of the plate is lost in this and the rest of the lines.  
^(\[2\]) One syllable after *dha* is indistinct and cannot be made out. It is engraved as *rai,* or *vai,* but what appears to be intended is *sya.*  
^(\[3\]) Both these *aksharas* are partly broken and their reading is not certain. They may also be read as *ddhāma.* The first three letters, though not separated by a punctuation mark as in the other cases, denote the names of the donee or his father.  
^(\[4\]) Perhaps a *daṇḍa* is intended here.  
^(\[5\]) Read *śāsanēna paradattâm* for *pradattaḥ.* One expects a word line *ēvaṁ,* before this and also *iti,* before *matvā.*  
^(\[6\]) The correct form would be *ētēshām=upanētavyam.*  
^(\[7\]) For *bhuktā,* as usually found.  
^(\[8\]) The use of the numeral showing repetition is noteworthy. Also see above, p. 319, Text-line 3.  
^(\[9\]) The *aksharas* in this line are slightly advanced in form than those in the main inscription. After *Jālha,* two of them are altogether lost, and the third one is indistinct. The reading of the number after *pâda* is also uncertain.  
^(\[10\]) The letters which are indistinct on the plate are shown here by the number of dots, and when more, by a line. The second line begins after some space in the first, and ends much before it.  
^(\[11\]) Reading from the original. The *aksharas* here are most slovenly formed and those in the brackets are also weather-worn, but are faintly visible.  
^(\[12\]) Both the numbers in the brackets are almost lost, and their reading is from the traces left.
