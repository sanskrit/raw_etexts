**INSCRIPTIONS OF THE CHANDELLAS OF JEJAKABHUKTI**

class-consonant following *r* is sometimes doubled and sometimes not ; examples of the first are afforded by *nirmmala,* and *kīrtti-,* both in l. 20, and of the second, by *nirmāṇa,* l. 4 and *karmāṇi,* l. 9. In the word *varga* occurring twice in the record, the *akshara* *g* is doubled in l. 25 but not in l. 7. *T* before *r* is also often doubled, *e.g., tattra,* l. 6^(\[1\]) ; (4) the *visarga* after *vaksha-* in l. 2 is dropped in accordance with *vārttika* on Pāṇini. VIII, 3, 36, and besides this we have four other cases of this type, in ll. 4, 6, 19 and 20 ; but in two examples, *viz., in –prāptiḥ = kshayāya,* l. 6, and *dharmmaḥ* = *pra-,* l. 28, the *visarga* is wrongly dropped ; (5) one of the two similar consonants forming a conjunct is dropped by syncopation in some instances like *ujvala,* in ll. 3, 5 and 11, satva, l, 11, *asṛikshīva* and *prōdyajvālā,* both in l. 16, and *rāgā = dṛishṭi,* in l. 24 ; (6) the *anusvāra* is often used for the nasals *n* and *m* and the final *m* is also incorrectly changed to it at the end of a stich ; on the other hand, it wrongly takes the place of a nasal in words like *vanśa,* l. 5, and *samvatsara* and *samvat,* both in l. 28 ; (7) the dental *n* stands for the lingual in *nishanna,* l. 8, and a superfluous *v* is inserted after *m* in words like *namvrī-,* l. 14 and *namvra,* l. 26 ; and finally, (8) the vowel *ṛi* is used for *ri* in *tṛidiva,* l. 24.

 The inscription belongs to the reign of **Dhaṅgadēva** of the **Chandrātrēya** (Chandēlla) **family.** It is a *praśasti,* a laudatory account, as stated twice in its vv. 47 and 48, and was composed by the poet **Mādhava,** whose father was Dēdda, a grammarian whose fame as a poet was celebrated in tales by wise men with repute (vv. 46-47). That this fame was well deserved is indicated by the style of composition. The inscription was written on stone, ‘in pleasing letters’, by the *karaṇika* **Jaddha,** the Gauḍa, who was a son of Jayaguṇa (?), the writer of the legal documents *(karaṇika).* The name of the engraver who was an artisan *(rūpakāra)* is lost in l. 28.

 The immediate **object** of the inscription is to record the construction of a temple of the enemy of the Daityas, *i.e.,* Vishṇu, by the illustrious **Yaśōvarman** (also called **Lakshavarman** in vv. 37 and 39) of the Chandrātrēya ruling house and setting up in the same an image of the god under the name Vaikuṇṭha (vv. 42-43). The record is dated, in l. 28, in words as well as in numerical figures, in the year **1011,** without any specification of the month, fortnight, *tithi* or week-day ; and the year which is evidently to be referred to the Vikrama era, is equivalent to **954 A.C.,** taking it as expired of the Chaitrādi year.

 The inscription may be divided into two parts. The first part, which traces the genealogy of the ruling house, ends with verse 41 ; and the second part, which speaks of the temple and the image and also gives some other particulars, comprises the remaining portion.

 After three *maṅgala-ślōkas* in praise of Vishṇu respectively under the names of the boar and man-lion incarnations, Vaikuṇṭha and Lakshmī’s husband, the record introduces the name of **Yaśōvarman,** referring to his personal qualities and valour (v. 4)2. In the following five verses that are devoted to describe the origin of the world and springing of the early sages of holy conduct, Marīchi and others from the mind Brahmā, it tells us that Atri, one of them, begat the sage Chandrātrēya and from him proceeded the family known after him. In that family was born the illustrious prince **Nannuka,** ‘a touch-stone to test the worth of the gold of the regal order’, whose fame spread far and wide and who conquered hosts of enemies (vv. 10-11). Nannuka’s son was **Vākpati,** whose fame was sung by Kirāta women in the Vindhya mountain (vv. 12-13). He had two sons, **Jayaśakti** and **Vijayaśakti** (vv. 14-15). The latter’s son was **Rāhila** who destroyed his adversaries (vv. 16-17), and his son again was **Harsha,** who was endowed with the excellencies like heroism, vigour and self-confidence. Harsha’s wife was **Kañchukā,** who sprang from the **Chāhamāna** tribe, and she bore to him a son, named Yaśōvarman, (vv. 18-22).

 Of all these names, those of Jayaśakti and Vijayaśakti are the same as Jējjāka and Vijjāka of the preceding inscription which also mentions the name of Harshadēva. It must however be stated here that much of the description in the present inscription is entirely conventional and altogether devoid of any historical interest. Yaśōvarman is further eulogised in as many as nineteen verses (23-41), most of which too are equally poetic and only mean to say that he was a great warrior destroying his antagonists, possessed wide fame which spread in all quarters and

 ^(\[1\]) In all such cases I find that the oblique strokes are three and therefore I have this *akshara* as *ttr* and not *tr,* as read by Kielhorn.
