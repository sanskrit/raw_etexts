**INSCRIPTIONS OF THE YAJVAPALAS OF NARWAR**

and we also find limbs of some of the letters occasionally omitted, *e.g., tasmād-* in l. 7 appears as *tasgād-,* without the horizontal stroke of *m,* and *viśva-* in l. 1, as *vimva,* as the tail of the left limb of *s* is omitted. On the other hand, a redundant chisel stroke has changed *g* to *m* in *gamya-,* l. 3, and t is often formed as *v, e.g., in tadā-,* l. 5. Errors of this type and subsequent corrections and insertions that the inscription often has are all noted in the text that follows.

The **language** is Sanskrit ; and with the exception of the opening word *Siddham* and the portion containing the date in the end, the record is metrically composed in the same fluent style as the preceding one, by the same poet Śivanābha. In all there are 27 verses, which are all numbered. It is interesting to note that verse 10 is composed in a metre of rare occurrence, known as *paṁkti* which belongs to the *supratishṭhā* group.

The following **orthographical** peculiarities may be noted. (1) The general use of v to denote *b* as in *-viṁvita-,* l. 2 ; (2) the doubling of a consonant following r with certain exceptions, cf, *kīrtti-* and *-ūrjita,* both in l. 5 ; (3) the occasional use of the dental for the palatal sibilant e.g., in *visuddha-,* l. 25, and *vice versa in śēnā,* l. 15 ; (4) the general use of the sign of *anusvāra* in place of an appropriate nasal, even at the end of a stich, with a few exceptions as in *kānti-kāntam,* l. 2. Besides these, the medial dipthongs are denoted sometimes by the *pṛishṭha-mātrā* and in the other instances by the *ūrdhva-mātrā* ; the sign of *avagraha* occurs only once, in l. 14, to denote the name of Ajayadēva correctly ; and the *kāka-pada* sign is used at the end of ll. 1, 2, 10 and 22.

The inscription is a prasasti (laudatory account), as the word is used in l. 26 (v. 26), and refers itself to the reign of **Gōpāladēva** of the royal house known as that of the **Jajapēlla (Yajvapāla)** dynasty of Nalagiri (the fort of **Narwar**). The immediate **object** of it is to record the excavation of a stepped well *(vāpī*) and planting of a garden by Gāṅgadēva, Minister of Gōpāladēva, evidently at Narwar, where the stone was found. The last line of the record shows the date in decimal figures only ; it is **Thursday, the tenth of the dark half of Pausha of the (Vikrama) year 1339.** which, as calculated by Dr. Sircar, regularly corresponds to **26th November, 1282 A. C.** The month was *Pūrṇimānta.*^(\[1\])

Like any other *praśasti,* the record falls into two parts, the first nine verses containing the *maṅgala-ślōkas* followed by the genealogical account of the royal house, and the remaining eighteen verses speaking about the well and its excavator, with the names of the composer, writer and the engraver of the composition. After the introductory word *Siddiḥ,* the inscription has two invocatory stanzas inviting the blessings of Sadāśiva and Achyuta, respectively. The next verse introduces Ratnagiri, and says that a hero of the name of **Jayapāla** was created by Maha(hā)ruṇḍā, who appears to have been the family-deity of the house to which he belonged. Ratnagiri, where the family is stated here to have its stay, cannot be satisfactorily identified, though Dr. Sircar suggests that it may be the same as the modern town of Ratangarh Kheḍī (Lat. 24 ̊ 49’ ; Long. 75 ̊ 13’) in the Mandsaur Distrcit of the former Gwālior State on the route from Neemuch to Būndī, 36 miles (58 kms. north-east of the former and 73 miles (117 kms.) south-east of the latter.^(\[2\]) The description of the mountain in v. 3, that it (is so lofty as to) obstruct the speed of the Sun’s chariot is all poetic. With reference to the family name Yajvapāla, it is possible to say that it may have been the Sanskritised from of Jayapāla who appears to be an eponymous hero, or mythical king, in view of the fact that the real history of the house begins from **Chāhaḍa.** This prince is stated to have captured, by the force of his arms, Nalagiri and some other places from his enemies whom he vanquished (vv. 6-7) ; and then we find the name of his son, **Nṛivarman.** After him *(tadanu)* was born **Āsalladēva** whose description is merely conventional (v. 8). The definite relationship between these two rulers is not mentioned in the present record, but from the other inscriptions of the house we know that the latter was the son of the former. Āsalladēva’s son was **Gōpāladēva** who is stated here

^(\[1\]) Sircar,*op. cit.,* p. 36.  
^(\[2\]) Ratnagiri can hardly be identical with Rarangarh, as suggested. The fort at that place is not old. See *G. A. R.* for 1929-30, p. 21, and besides, it is situated about 460 kms. south-west of Narwar. It is possible that the place may have been identical with the village known as *Dōṅgar,* lying almost mid-way between Narwar and Shivpurī (See G. A. R. for 1928-29, p. 11), but in this case we have to presume that this place was called by the name Ratna, or it may have been a poetic fancy. In any way the hill appears to be near Narwar and not so far in the Mandsaur district.
