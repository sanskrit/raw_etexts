**SUPPLEMENTARY INSCRIPTIONS**

Charkhari grant of the latter. Or it may be, as we have already suggested while editing this grant, that Bhōjavarman’s name may have been omitted in it, as he may have been a collateral of Hammīravarman and possibly another son of Vīravarman.^(\[1\]) Neither of these views can be finalised unless we get some fresh material to enlighten us on the point.

There is only one **geographical name** mentioned in the inscription. It is **Jayapura-durga,** which is, as we have seen above, the fort of Ajaygaḍh where the inscription was found.

No. 194 ; PLATE CLXX  
PANNA STONE PEDESTAL INSCRIPTION  
\[ Vikrama \] Year 1366

THIS inscription was first brought to notice by N. P. Chakravarti, Government Epigraphist, who published a short abstract of its contents in the *Annual Report* of the Archaeological Survey of India, 1930-34, p. 94. It is edited here for the first time from an inked impression kindly supplied by the Chief Epigraphist.

The inscription is incised below a group of images, carved on a block of stone, which Chakravarti found lying near the waterfall in the old part of the town of **Pannā,** the headquarters of a district of that name in Madhya Pradesh. The record falls into two parts, called here **A** and **B.** Part **A,** which is on the left-hand side, covers a space measuring 33 cms. broad by 6.5 cms. high ; and part **B,** which is on the right-hand side, measures 92 cms. broad by 12 cms. high. The former contains 2 lines of writing, with nine or ten **aksharas** in the end of the third line, and the latter 3 lines, the last of which is about half in length of the other two. The average size of the letters is about 2.5 and 3 cms., respectively.

The inscription is very carelessly written, and it has also suffered considerably on both the sides ; but much of it can be read with confidence, except a few letters which have altogether disappeared or have left only a few traces. The **characters** belong to the Nāgarī alphabet of about the beginning of the fourteenth century A.C. The **language** is Sanskrit and the record is throughout in prose. The **orthography** does not call for any special notice.

The **object** of the inscription is to record the installation of a group of images by Suhaḍadēva, the son of Ashau and the grandson of Vāśē, born in the Vāstavya Kayastha family,

^(\[2\]) From an impression, which is No. B-192/69-70 of *A.R. of Ind. Ep.*  
^(\[3\]) The sign of *mātrā* of the first *akshara* of the name is detached from it.  
^(\[4\]) This and the names that follow are all without case-endings, which can easily be supplied.  
^(\[5\]) The consonants of this and the preceding letter are conjunct ; but I am unable to make them out from the impression. The reading of both these letters is uncertain.  
^(\[6\]) In the transcript the names are separated by me with horizontal strokes for facility of reading.  
^(\[7\]) The *mātrā* is denoted by a curve above. ^(\[8\]) A flourish above the first of these letters denoting the *mātrā* is to be seen.
