^(\[1\]) Here the reading is certain but I am unable to make out the sense.  
^(\[2\]) The horizontal stroke of this akshara is not incised and the one marking it as consonant resembles the *mātrā* of long *ū,* the whole letter appearing as gu. Some other omissions of this type there are but they are not noted separately.  
^(\[3\]) The stroke is to show that the word ends in the next line.  
^(\[4\]) Read *sudhāṁśu.*  
^(\[5\]) The Sanskrit form of this name would be *ajayinī.*  
^(\[6\]) This word strictly means ‘a hair’ and hence it is better to read *tanūdbhavaḥ.*  
^(\[7\]) Grammar requires a *visarga* after *ghu,* but it would not suit the metre.  
^(\[8\]) *Mudrā* is the mode of holding the fingers in religious worship.  
^(\[9\]) Read *guravō babhūvuḥ* dropping *atra* to suit the metre.  
^(\[10\]) The consonant of the *akshara* appears as *s*.
