¹ From facsimile in *Ind. Ant.,* Vol. XVI.  
² Denoted by a symbol.  
³ Here and in some cases below, which are not separately noted, the sign of punctuation is redundant.  
⁴ That is, Karṇa. The consonant of the preceding ![](lg5.JPG) is not well formed.  
⁵ The akshara in the brackets was originally omitted and was later on written below the line with an arrow-mark to draw attention, but after the sign of*visarga* and not before where it is actually to be supplied. This was not noted by Kielhorn.  
⁶ Better read -![](lg6.JPG)-.

⁷ The reading of the consonant of this *akshara,* as also noted by Kielhorn, is not certain. In ![](lg7.JPG) that precedes, the vertical showing the *mātrā* in the third *akshara* is detached from it so as to look like a *daṇḍa.*  
⁸ This *akshara,* which was originally omitted, is writing below the line but without an arrow-mark to draw attention to it as in n. 4, absent.  
⁹ Kielhorn read ![](lg8.JPG), but to me it appears to be as given here. What follows the point of ![](lg9.JPG) is a chisel-stroke and not the bend.  
¹⁰ The reading of the first *akshara* of the name is not certain. Moreover, no *sandhi* is made here as also in ![](lg10.JPG) that precedes.  
The Sanskrit form of the name that follows is ![](lg11.JPG).  
¹¹ This *akshara* is followed by two small dots vertically placed. It cannot be ascertained whether they form she sign of the visarga  
inserted subsequently or are merely stokes of the chisel.  
¹² This word is not known in dictionaries. The context, however, shows that vāha, water-ourse, is intended. See *n.* on this word in  
No. 4, l. 11, above. The word *vāha* occurs also in No. 100, l. 10.
