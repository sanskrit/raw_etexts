¹ There two *aksharas* may also be read as *lē hi.*  
² Probably *tālapatra, i.e.,* ear-ornament. The word *kṛittidāra* is also not known to the dictionaries.  
³ A bodice. *Kañchōla* is probably *kañchuka.*  
⁴ Kielhorn remarked that he does not understand this word. To me, however, it appears to denote the egg-shaped object attached to the *chhatra,* below, for ornamentation.  
⁵ The first of these objects is a precious stone and the second, bell-metal.  
⁶ A drum. The word *vāḍhaḍhā* is again unknown.  
⁷ Both these strokes are ornamental and one of them is superfluous.
