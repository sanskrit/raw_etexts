**INSCRIPTIONS OF THE CHANDELLAS OF JEJAKABHUKTI**

**PACHHĀR COPPER-PLATE INSCRIPTION OF PARAMARDIDĒVA**

by Venis, it may have been the one which is the largest and most important and what is situated about 8 kms, north-east of Chirgāon and 15 kms, north-east of Pachhār.¹ The place where the king took bath before making the grant is not mentioned, but it may have been on the banks of the Vētravatī which flows not far from the find-spot of the inscription. And finally, Mutāüsha, the original place of the donee (l. 11), I am unable to trace.
