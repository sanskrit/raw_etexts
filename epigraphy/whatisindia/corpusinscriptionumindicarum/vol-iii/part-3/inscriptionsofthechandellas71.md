**INSCRIPTIONS OF THE CHANDELLAS OF JEJAKABHUKTI**

^(\[1\]) The word *grāma* is in masculine; probably *gramē* is intended, as in the next instance.  
^(\[2\]) Sircar read *Nādūkēna;* but the curve of the mātrā above k is clear though faint. Possibly there is also an *anusvāra* on the first of these *aksharas.* Similarly, in the name of the queen in this line the curve of the medial *i* on *mā* was also missed by Sircar, who read the name as *Lakhamā.*  
^(\[3\]) The upper curve of vi is certain and I hesitate to accept Sircar’s reading of the name as *Davēha.* The previous name may, however, be also read as *Nandavēṇa,* as suggested by him.  
^(\[4\]) Sircar states that the reading may also be the *Chandēla,* but the vertical stroke of the *mātrā* is nearer to the first of the *aksharas* and hence I have adopted the name as given here.  
^(\[5\]) Perhaps the word *bhāga* is omitted before *bhōga* through inadvertence.  
^(\[6\]) In place of these four *aksharas* some others were probably incised originally.  
^(\[7\]) The reading is certain but the word *talla* does not give any sense. Probably talka, meaning a forest is intended.  
^(\[8\]) The upper curve of the *mātrā* is missing in this *akshara* and also in *mi* of *bhūmi* that follows in the same line.
