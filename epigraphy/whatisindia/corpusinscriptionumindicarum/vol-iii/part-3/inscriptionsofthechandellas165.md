No. 145 ; PLATE CXXXII

**AJAYAGAḌH ROCK INSCRIPTION OF THE TIME OF VĪRAVARMAN**

\[ Vikrama \] Year 1317

THIS inscription was noticed for the first time, with a photograph and a somewhat incorrect abstract of its contents, by Sir Alexander Cunningham in his *Archaeological Survey of India Reports,* Vol. XXI (1883-85), p. 51 and Pl. xiii-E. Subsequently it was edited by F. Kielhorn, with a translation but without a facsimile, in the *Epigraphia Indica,* Vol. I (1888), pp. 325 ff. In this edition Kielhorn, who prepared the text of it from Cunningham’s rubbings placed at his disposal by Fleet, has also pointed out the errors in Cunningham’s account of it, which was based on its reading by his Simla Paṇḍit. The inscription is edited here from a fresh impression which I owe to the courtesy of the Chief Epigraphist, Archaeological Survey of India.⁶
