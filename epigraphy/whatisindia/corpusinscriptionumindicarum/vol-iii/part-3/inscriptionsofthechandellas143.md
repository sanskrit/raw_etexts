¹ From an impression, comparing the reading subsequently from the original (Lucknow Museum *catalogue,* No. E-23).  
² Expressed by a symbol.  
³ Partly from the traces and partly from conjecture the missing letters appear to be *-ṅkurāḥ*  
⁴ The consonant of this letter appears as *ṭh.*  
⁵ Both the letters in the brackets are from Kielhorn’s reading. It is not known whether he restored them conjecturally or from the traces visible in his time which are now no longer extant.  
⁶ Read ![](nitro3.JPG). The lost letters at the end may have been ![](nitro2.JPG), as may be conjectured.  
⁷ Kielhorn’s transcript shows that only the sign of *visarga* was then lost. But since his time the stone has lost some more *aksharas,* particularly near the crack.  
⁸ Here, and also in some cases below, the slanting stroke distinguishing the preceding *akshara* from *p* is not distinct. From some traces before this word and below the line, it appears that the preceding *n* may have been engraved there. A curve above the *mātrā* of *kā* may possible have been struck off in the original.  
⁹ The reading of the second of these letters is not certain. The bracketed *aksharas* may also have been ![](nitro10.JPG).  
¹⁰ The *mātrā* of ![](nitro11.JPG) is lost, leaving only a trace.  
¹¹ The bracketed syllable is formed as *ma* and the preceding *v* is engraved as the left limb of *ga.*  
¹² The subscript of *dvi* is cut as *ch* and what appears as the sign of *anusvāra* above is only an original fault of the stone.  
¹³ All the *aksharas* of the second quarter of this verse are only in form of traces now.  
¹⁴ Read ![](nitro12.JPG)  
¹⁵ The letters in the brackets which are indistinct in the impression, are adopted here from Kielhorn’s reading. They are, however, distinct  
on the stone.
