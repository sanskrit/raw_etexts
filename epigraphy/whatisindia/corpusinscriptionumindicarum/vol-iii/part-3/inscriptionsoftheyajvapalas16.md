^(\[1\]) This daṇḍa is thin and was engraved subsequently.  
^(\[2\]) The sign of visarga was inserted subsequently.  
^(\[3\]) The kāka-pada sign is engraved here and also at the end of some of the lines below.  
^(\[4\]) As n. 3 above. Mahīdēva means a Brāhmaṇa.  
^(\[5\]) First rma engraved and then altered to rmma.  
^(\[6\]) On the original ![](106.JPG) later on changed to ![](107.JPG) and the mātrā of the following letter has been scored off. But ![](108.JPG) remains as before. The following letters were read by Sircar, as ![](109.JPG).  
^(\[7\]) This sign for visarga was first engraved and later on scored off as redundant, by standing strokes.  
⁸ The sign of visarga was later on inserted.  
^(\[9\]) The superscript r is clear on the original, though not in the impression.  
^(\[10\]) Sircar read ![](110.JPG).  
^(\[11\]) Both the bracketed aksharas are mutilated and the reading is only conjectural. The idea here is that he did not marry again *(nirāśraya)* after the loss *(apāya)* of his consort, as Rāma did not marry another after that of Sītā. Here Sircar read : ![](111.JPG).  
^(\[12\]) The letters *tishṭha* were repeated and later on scored off by vertical strokes above the top-strokes.
