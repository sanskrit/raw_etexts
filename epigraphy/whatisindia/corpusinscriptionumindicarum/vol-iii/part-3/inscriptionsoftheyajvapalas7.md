\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
^(\[1\]) The first letter in this line was originally engraved as given here but subsequently it was changed to *hma.*  
^(\[2\]) This family is the same as Paurapāṭa appearing in line 23 above.  
^(\[3\]) Read *kalāvatāṁ.*  
^(\[4\]) A *daṇḍa* at the end of this line, as also at the end of some others below, is only to fill in the gap.  
^(\[5\]) Read *dhārayan* but it would not suit the metre.  
^(\[6\]) The reading is certain but what is intended is not precisely known. Moreover, the number of the verse is followed by a vacant space for three *aksharas* which began the verse in *Śālinī,* as is evident from what follows. The preceding name *Chāhaḍa* is engraved in comparatively smaller letters.  
^(\[7\]) *Sarvajña,* which is a synonym of Buddha, is here to denote Jina. Moreover, a participle from the adjective *smēra* is formed here. The flaw can be removed by reading *smēra pathōja.* The first three *aksharas* of this verse are lost. Conjecturally they may have been bhāsvaddhā.  
^(\[8\]) Originally *chēḥ* with the sign of *mātrā* erased later on.  
^(\[9\]) Both these letters are crisped into each other.  
^(\[10\]) The reading of these letters is certain, but the meaning is not clear.  
^(\[11\]) The decimal figure of this number was at first carved as two horizontal strokes and subsequently corrected.  
^(\[12\]) The bracketed letter is not well formed and therefore the reading is not certain.  
^(\[13\]) The three letters were not engraved on the original stone and the space for them was left vacant.  
^(\[14\]) The reading of this and the preceding *akshara* is not certain as one of them is overwritten, after tampering the original.  
^(\[15\]) This letter is deformed and the sign of *visarga,* which was first put, was subsequently rubbed off. Read ![](sixtythree.JPG).  
^(\[16\]) There are two redundant horizontal strokes here.
