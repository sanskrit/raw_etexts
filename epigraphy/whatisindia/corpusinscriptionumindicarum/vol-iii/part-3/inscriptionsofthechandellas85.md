No. 126 ; PLATE CXIII

SĒMRĀ COPPER-PLATE GRANT OF PARAMARDIDĒVA

\[Vikrama\] Year 1223

THE plates on which this record is engraved are said to have been found in September 1892, at **Sēmrā,**⁶ a village in the former State of Bijāwar which is now the chief town of a *tehsīl* in the Chhatarpur District of the Bundelkhand region of Madhya Pradesh. The actual circumstances of their discovery are not known, but it is stated that the plates were presented to the Provincial Museum, Lucknow, by the Chief of Bijāwar, through the Political Agent at Nowgong. The inscription was brought to notice by A. Führer who took impressions, and sent the same to Professor Bühler ; and from these impressions the record was edited by W. Cartellieri with facsimiles of the first two sides out of four in all, in the *Epigraphist Indica,* Vol. IV (1896-97), pp. 153 ff. The inscription is edited here from two sets of impressions prepared and made

¹ This verse appears to have a pun in the word Gadādhara, also meaning Vishṇu, but unfortunately it is much lost.  
² It is easy to conjecture the two *aksharas* - ![](mc31.JPG)- here so as to complete the verse.  
³ The first *akshara* appears to have been *jha* in view of the following.  
⁴ As for these *aksharas* Kielhorn noted that they may possibly be read on the original, but in the absence of it, I suggest ![](mc32.JPG) here, which also suit the metre.  
⁵ Kielhorn has noted that at the end of l. 28 some of the *aksharas* are completely lost and it is not possible to know whether there was more writing after l. 29. But I think the poet’s name and the year of the record may have been given here, as is usually the case.  
⁶ The village lies in the extreme south-west borders of the *parganā,* about 32 kms. south-west of Bijāwar. It is about 15 kms, west of Shāhgaḍh a Police-station in the Sāgar District, and about 50 kms, south- east of Lalitpur, a *tehsīl* in the Jhānsī District and a station between Vidishā and Jhānsi on the Central Railway.
