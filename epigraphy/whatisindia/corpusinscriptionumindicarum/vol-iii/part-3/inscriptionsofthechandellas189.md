**INSCRIPTIONS OF THE CHANDELLAS OF JEJAKABHUKTI**

four-armed goddess **Lakshmī,** seated on a lotus and holding lotus-flowers in both of her upper hands which are raised, and a water-pot on the palm of each of the remaining two.

The **characters** are Nāgarī, but, to judge from the impression, there are cases where the exact forms of the letters cannot be clearly made out. For example, besides the fact that *ch* is almost similar to *v,* the form of this letter is often confounded with that of *r,* as in *vīra-,* l. 2, that of *d* with *h,* as in *vadi,* l. 13, and that of the dental *s* with palatal *ś,* as in *Viśvēsvara,* l. 1, and occasionally also with that of *t, e.g.,* in ll. 3 and 6 where the two letters appear as *tyādi,* as they may have been intended to be, but the same also appear as *sāhi* in l. 5. This sort of confusion here and there is also responsible for the fact that some of the letters cannot satisfactorily be deciphered in l. 14 and l. 15, as to be seen in the transcript.

Nor is the mechanical execution satisfactory. The interiors of most of the letters show marks of the working of the tool of the engraver, who has also deformed some of the *aksharas, e.g., bhrājishṇu* in l. 2 is engraved as *–pnu,* by omitting the slanting stroke which distinguishes *sh* from *p,* and *rāja* in l. 4 has become *saja* by a redundant stroke between the letter *r* and the vertical following it, *matpara-* in l. 4 is engraved as *masana,* and *sahasrā-* in l. 17, as *mahapā.* Occasionally the upper curve of the medial *i* is omitted, as also the sign of the *visarga,* as in ll. 11-12. The writer too is equally responsible for commissions and omissions; for example, he wrote *paryantān* as *prajantān* in l. 10, *Bhārdvāja* for *Bhāradvāja* in l. 13, and has made confusion between *r* as a superscript and a subscript, *e.g.,* by writing *tartta* for *tatra* in l. 2 and *svagra* for *svarga* in ll. 17 and 19, by omitting some words from the draft, as in l. 12, by putting unnecessary punctuation marks as in ll. 3-7, and occasionally marking the same as to appear signs of *pṛishṭha-mātrās* or of the secondary ā. Mistakes of the writer who possessed only a smattering of Sanskrit, and also of the engraver who appears to have been a novice, are to be noted throughout the record, as pointed out in the notes to the text.

The **language** is Sanskrit, full of errors as stated above; and with the exception of the first verse which generally occurs at the beginning of the Chandēlla grants and four customary and benedictory verses at the end, the record is in prose. The first verse is not numbered and the last four are numbered from one to four. With respect to **orthography,** we note (1) the use of the dental *s* for the palatal *ś* in many places, and *vice versa,* occasionally, *e.g.,* in *subha-*, l. 13 and *śakala* (for *sakala*), l. 8; (2) the doubling of a class-consonant, *e.g.,* in *karmma-,* l. 19; (3) denoting *b* throughout by the sign for *v, e.g.,* in *brāhmaṇa-,* l. 9; (4) showing the medial dipthongs by the *pṛishṭha-mātrā* here and there; (5) the use of the dental nasal for the lingual in *punya-,* l. 19, and *vice versa* in *saṁkalpēṇa,* l. 15, and writing *ujjvala-* with a single *j* in l. 1, *kṛimi* as *krami* in l. 18; (6) not marking the consonant *t* in *saṁvat,* l. 13, but on the other hand, wrongly marking it in *anudhyāta* in ll. 4-6. And lastly, it is interesting to note that the *visarga* after *bhi* in *rājabhiḥ,* l. 16 and *pitṛibhiḥ,* l. 18 is changed to s before the same letter.

It is royal charter issued by the illustrious *Mahārāja* **Hammiravarmmadēva** of the **Chandēlla** house; and its **object** is to record the donation of the village Kōkaḍa or Kīkaḍa (?) in the Vēdēsaitha (nya?) *vishaya.* The donees were two Brāhmaṇas, who appeared to have been brothers, *viz.,* the *Paṇḍita* Śrīdhara and the *Paṇḍita* Ābhē of the Bhāradvāja *gōtra,* and the sons of Sahila, grandson of the *Ṭhakkura S*(Ś)ubharāja and great-grandsons of the *Ṭhakkura* Vidyādhara.¹ The grant was made on **Sunday, the twelfth** *tithi* of the **dark fort-night of Bhādrapada of the (Vikrama) year 1346,** when the *nakshatra* was Pushya. The *tithi* and the year are expressed in numerical symbols only, and the day has been calculated by Hiralal to regularly correspond to **Sunday, the 11th September, 1289 A.C**.² The charter was written by the Paṇḍita Raum (Rāma) pāla. It does not contain the sculptor’s name.

After an auspicious symbol followed by the verse eulogising the Chandrātrēya (Chandēlla) dynasty of kings, the document mentions the names of **Jayaśakti** and **Vijayaśakti** who were the earliest rulers belonging to it. This portion has been copied verbatim from the earlier records of the house. The document then proceeds to trace the pedigree of the ruling king, Hammī-

¹ The text here is corrupt and for the precise relationship of these persons, see *f. n.* to the transcript.  
² Hiralal has also noted that the twelfth *tithi* commenced on Sunday at .98 but the *nakshatra Pushya* ended on that day at .23. Thus, his calculation, which is for the *amānta* Bhādrapada, presents a difficulty. And hence I prefer to accept the calculation of Chakravarti, according to whom the corresponding date would be the 14th August, 1289, following the month as *pūrṇimānta* and showing all the details correctly.
