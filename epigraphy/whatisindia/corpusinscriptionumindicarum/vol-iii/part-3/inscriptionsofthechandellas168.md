¹ From an impression.  
² Expressed by a symbol.  
³ The consonant of *su* appears more like *ś.*  
⁴ Kielhorn read the preceding letter as *dhi,* but it has no horn on the left limb, as the other letters in this inscription.  
⁵ Kielhorn translated this expression as ‘a god of love to opponents’, and added in a *f.n*. that ‘it admits of no other interpretation, as the word *madana* itself is one of the synonyms of *manmatha (op. cit.,* p. 329, n. 26). But this sense is not applicable here and we have to take the word *manmatha* in its literary meaning, *manāṁsi mathnāti, i.e.,* wrankling (as a thorn) in the minds of (his adversaries). In this verse, moreover, the word *tasmāt* has to be taken in the sense of *tasmādanantaram, i.e.,* after him, and not from him as we know that Pŗithvīvarman was an uncle of Jayavarman.  
⁶ The *aksharas* in the brackets have now totally disappeared.  
⁷ This letter appears as *dh.* The expression *bāl = ōpi nētā* reminds us of an analogous instance of the Pāla king Gōpāla III, who came to the throne when he was a child. See *Ep. Ind.,* Vol. XXXV. p. 232.  
⁸ These three *aksharas* are now totally lost and Kielhorn’s reading is adopted here. But possibly *mahēndrō* appears to have been originally engraved here.  
⁹ The word Vīra in the first quarter of this verse is a contracted form of the name of the king; and following this clue, I read*-varmmaḥ (varmma)* here, as the first of these letters is without a horn on its left limb, as the second in this expression.  
¹⁰ Perhaps it may be read as ![](lexus401.JPG)  
¹¹ As Kielhorn also remarked, this letter may have a *mātrā* or an *anusvāra* above. The Kshatriya caste is fabled to have sprung from the arms of Brahmā.  
¹² *Śivā* is a synonym of *Pārvatī.* Kielhorn read *śivēna* which cannot be construed here.  
¹³ The consonant of the first letter may also have been *d;* and the second letter is mutilated.
