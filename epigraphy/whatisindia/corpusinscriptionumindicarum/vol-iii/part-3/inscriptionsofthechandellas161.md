¹ This yati has one letter more. Mirashi corrects it to ![](nesus3.JPG). It may also be restored as ![](nesus4.JPG) as already suggested by Chakravarti.  
² This *daṇḍa* as also some others below is redundant.  
³ As already noted by Chakravarti and Mirashi, this verse occurs in Daṇḍin’s *Kāvyādarśa,* I, l.  
⁴ The *akshara* ![](nesus5.JPG) is written above the line.  
⁵ The *sandhi* is neglected here, as also in some places below, sometimes not noted here separately.  
⁶ The medial *ā*-sign of *kā* is applied to the preceding letter by mistake.  
⁷ The third letter in this line looks somewhat like *nna.* Read ![](nesus6.JPG).  
⁸ The consonant of the first letter of the name can also be read as *ch,* for which see *chaṁda* and *pañcha-* in the next line. Read ![](nesus7.JPG) as suggested by V. V. Mirashi.  
⁹ A redundant stroke appears above the first letter in the line. Read
-*śrēshṭhi-,* which appears without any case-ending as some other titles and names below.  
¹⁰ Restore ![](nesus8.JPG) is redundant. It appears to mean ‘with due deliberations’.  
¹¹ As already noted by Mirashi, ‘this expression seems to be out of place in a deed of mortgage’.  
¹² It appears rather curious that the Śaiva ascetic should call himself as devoted to the feet of the king.  
¹³ Read ![](nesus9.JPG)  
¹⁴ Read ![](nesus10.JPG): As already noted by Chakravarti, the name is here in the honorific plural whereas all the qualifying adjectives are in the singular.  
¹⁵ That is, ![](nesus11.JPG).  
¹⁶ The reading of the bracketed *akshara* is doubtful and I have followed Mirashi’s reading.  
¹⁷ Here also I agree with Mirashi in taking the second *akshara* of the name as *lau,* and not *lī,* as taken by Chakravarti, remarking that  
*lau* which was first engraved was subsequently corrected into *lī.* Mirashi particularly draws our attention to similar *mātrās* of medial *au* in *Kalau,* ll. 11-12  
¹⁸ Mirashi elsewhere takes this word in the sense of ‘banker’ *(C. I. I.,* Vol. IV, p. 331, *n*.), but it does not suit here. The word, which is  
obviously derived from *pravaṇa,* meaning ‘a descent’ and also ‘a place where four roads meet’, appears to denote the customs duty  
charged here on articles brought from other places.  
¹⁹ The correct construction would be ![](nesus12.JPG): Also read ![](nesus13.JPG).
