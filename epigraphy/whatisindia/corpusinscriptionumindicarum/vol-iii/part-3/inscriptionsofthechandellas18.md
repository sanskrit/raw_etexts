^(\[1\]) As *n.* 7 above. This verse has the figure of speech known as *parisaṅkhyā,* instances of which are found in the *Kādambarī* and some other works of the type. It means to say that *bhaṅga* (break and curls of hair), ¬*kēśa-graha* (seizure by the hair), hardness, crookedness, stain, self-willingness, aversion and superficiality ─ all these are to be found only in what is mentioned with each of there and not in his kingdom. There is a play on the word *mitra,* meaning (1) the Sun and (2) a friend.  
^(\[2\]) By a wrong stroke of the chisel the bracketed letter appears as *hā.*  
^(\[3\]) The *daṇḍa* is redundant.  
^(\[4\]) Originally (Sanskrit). But what one naturally expects is (Sanskrit).  
^(\[5\]) This verse and No. 11 that follows are introduced in the middle of a prose portion, as in a *Champūkāvya* and the word *pravēśīkṛita* is used for, as Kielhorn has already observed, *pravishṭa* or *pravēśita.* It means to say that when the orb of the ‘deer-marked’ (moon), the root (source) of joy to the heart of Rohiṇī, had been devoured by the son of Siṁhikā (Rāhu), *i.e.,* when there was a lunar eclipse.  
^(\[6\]) Read (Sanskrit)-.  
^(\[7\]) The *daṇḍa* is superfluous.  
^(\[8\]) The consonant of the first *akshara* of the name might also be read as *.ch; cf. ch in chatuḥ* ─ appearing just before in the same line. The village is described as ‘appertaining to Ūsharavāha, with its water and (dry) land, with its low and high (land), with its mango and *madhūka (madhuca indica)* trees and with its fertile and saline soil’.  
^(\[9\]) I am very doubtful about the reading of this *akshara,* through I have adopted it as read by Kielhorn. What looks like *t* at the beginning may have been a wrongly cut loop of *m.*  
^(\[10\]) Some word like *iti* has to be supplied after this verse  
^(\[11\]) Here the work *suvarṇa* is used in the sense of a gold coin. For the sake of metrical euphony, read (Sanskrit).  
^(\[12\]) Kielhorn takes *karma* in the sense of *vidhivat;* but comparing the use of this word in some other records. I feel that it has the sense of *kram-āgata, i.e.,* ‘obtained by succession’. See C. I. I., Vol. IV, p. 222, n. 1.  
^(\[13\]) Here we have the use of *anusvāra,* unlike in all the other instances in the record where we have the nasal.
