¹ From Kielhorn’s transcript in *Ep. Ind.,* Vol. l. pp. 197 ff.  
² Kielhorn has noted that this verse is preceded by traces of about twelve *aksharas* and that one should expect here ![](mc2.JPG), or some similar phrase.  
³ It is impossible to say exactly how many *aksharas* are effaced at the end of this and the beginning of the next line (K.).  
⁴ The name missing here before *nāmā* may have been . Similarly, the first two *aksharas* in the next line may have been ![](mc3.JPG). The lost portion of this verse may conjecturally be restored as ![](mc4.JPG) ![](mc5.JPG).  
⁵ From the back of the impression before him. Kielhorn was certain that the first letter is ![](mc7.JPG)  
⁶ The gap may be filled in by ![](mc8.JPG)-, which suits the sense and also the metre. Similarly, one would expect something like ![](mc9.JPG) at the beginning of the next verse and ![](mc10.JPG) at its end.  
⁷ My conjectural suggestion for the *aksharas* missing here is ![](mc11.JPG) and ![](mc12.JPG) in the lacuna that follows.  
⁸ Kielhorn remarked that ![](mc13.JPG)should be ![](mc14.JPG) here. He has also noted that the internal enemies are *kāma* (desire), Krōdha (wrath), *lōbha* (covetousness), *mōha* (bewilderment), *mada* (pride) and *matsara* (envy) ; and the seven constituent parts of the kingdom are : the king, his minister, capital, realm, treasury, army and ally, Cf. *Manu,* IX, 291.
