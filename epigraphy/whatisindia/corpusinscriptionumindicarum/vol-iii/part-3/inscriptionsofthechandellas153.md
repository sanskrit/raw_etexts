¹ The last line containing the name of the king is hidden beneath the copper-band. See the last line in the second inscription.  
² As in *n.* 2 above.  
³ Dikshit read this letter as ![](nitro42.JPG) and corrected it to ![](nitro43.JPG) ; but similar form of the palatal sibilant without the top-knot appears in some other  
instances also in the inscription, for which see *Vaiśākha,* in l. 10  
⁴ The *akshara* in the brackets appears as ![](nitro46.JPG).  
⁵ This *ē* looks exactly as *pa.*  
⁶ Dikshit read the letter as *rva,* but it is exactly as taken here in the transcript.  
⁷ The letter *t* here is double and not single a taken by Dikshit.  
⁸ The letters in brackets in this and the following lines are either completely or partly hidden beneath the protecting bad, or are mutilated.  
The restoration, however, is not difficult.
