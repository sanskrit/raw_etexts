¹ Perhaps something like ![](miti2.JPG): is intended, in the sense of ‘was as prominent as Indra’. ![](miti3.JPG) (?)  
² That is, he was devoted to both Vishṇu and Śiva. The letters are mutilated, and it is not known if ![](miti3.JPG) is intended.  
³ The verticals of *vā* are jointed by a stroke as of *dhā.*  
⁴ The reading of the bracketed letter is not certain ; it may also have been ![](miti4.JPG). From the lithograph in *A. S. I. R.,* the name appears to have been ![](miti5.JPG), but nothing is certain.  
⁵ Both these *aksharas* are obliterated and their consonants appear to have been *t* and *m,* respectively. A word meaning ‘governed’ may be expected here. With some hesitation Chakravarti read here the name Bhōja (?).  
⁶ Most of the letters of the latter half of this verse are either altogether lost or partly visible. One would expect here the name of Madanavarman and of either his minister or his subordinate.  
⁷ The traces indicate that these two *aksharas* may have been *draṇṇē,* but the complete word cannot be made out so as to give some sence. The last two *aksharas* in the line may have been *nityaṁ* or *sadā,* to fill in the gap.  
⁸ Chakravarti read this name as Jagaddhara; but besides the fact that it would not suit the metre. I find the sign of the *mātrā* (of long *ī*) very clear in the impression.  
⁹ That is, the two Aśvins (Physicians of gods). It is unfortunate that the letters showing the names of the two brothers are broken here.  
¹⁰ Only traces of these three letters are left. A word like ![](miti6.JPG) which also suits the metre, may have been written and engraved here.  
¹¹ The consonant of the first *akshara* in this line is *d,* as also read by Chakravarti, but it appears to be the engraver’s mistake who left the middle portion of the vertical in the process of carving, of which we have a number of examples. *Dāṇī-* would also give no sense.  
¹² The unit figure is mutilated but the reading is certain.
