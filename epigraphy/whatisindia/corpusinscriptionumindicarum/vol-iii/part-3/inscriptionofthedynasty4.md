^(\[1\]) From a photograph.  
^(\[2\]) Denoted by a symbol.  
^(\[3\]) Kirtane omitted these three aksharas in his transcript.  
^(\[4\]) Kirtane read ![](fourty.JPG), here, and also in l. 7, but the reading as taken above is quite certain. This name occurs also in No. 30, 1, 6, above.

^(\[5\],) The cursive stroke at the bottom shows this letter to be a *dda,,* probably intended for *da,* as also read by Kirtane. It is in the sense of rank or dignity.. In his *List of Inscriptions,* No. 229. D. R. Bhandakar took the whole word *bhartṛi-paṭṭa* to a denote a title. He evidently followed G. H. Ojha who read the same in an inscription noticed by him in *A. R., Rājputānā Museum,* 1915-16, p. 3.  
^(\[6\]) An arow-mark appears here to indicate that the word is continued in the next line.  
^(\[7\]) Kirtane read the five letters in this line as ![](fourtyone.JPG) and took the expression to mean an “officer who keeps time”. The consonants of the first of these letters can also be taken as th, but that of the third is definitely as taken here, for which, cf, *Gadēlāka* in the same line and *.Iṅgaṇa*- in l. 1, above, and 7, below. The *.akshara n* in the fourth one appears as if omitted at first and inserted later on, by a small scratch. Thus here we have the name of the royal-preceptor whose presence is shown while making a grant, which is not the case with the time-keeper.  
^(\[8\]) Kirtane read the first akshara of the name as ![](fortythree.JPG), but in the translation as ![](fortyfour.JPG). The following *daṇḍa* is superfluous.  
^(\[9\]) This is a contraction of *śrēshṭhin.* The names appearing in 11. 5-6 are all without any case-ending and often the *sandhi*-rules also not observed.  
^(\[10\]) Read ![](fortyfive.JPG).  
^(\[11\]) On ksha there is a redundant anusvāra or a fault of the stone.  
^(\[12\]) Perhaps originally *mai,* with the sign of *mātrā* erased later on. The *dātī* appears to have been wrongly engraved for *datti,* which means a  
gift. See C. I. I., Vol. IV, p. 617, n. 5.  
^(\[13\]) Read ![](fortysix.JPG) Kirtane took the following *daṇḍa* as a medial *ä,* which is evidently wrong.  
^(\[14\]) Read ![](fortyseven.JPG) The following two aksharas are redundant.  
^(\[15\]) Read ![](fortyeight.JPG):  
^(\[16\]) Read ![](fortynine.JPG)  
^(\[17\]) The *akshara* stands for ![](fifity.JPG). Or better read ![](fiftyone.JPG).
