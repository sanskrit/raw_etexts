**INSCRIPTIONS OF THE CHANDELLAS OF JEJAKABHUKTI**

![](sr137.JPG)

It will be seen that in a few cases (Nos. 3, 5-7 and 10), only the names of the donees are mentioned without any further details, and in three of the instances (Nos. 1, 4 and 12), the surnames are also mentioned along with the *gōtras.*

The record is of considerable historical interest as it reveals the existence of an altogether new Kachchhapaghāta house reigning at Narwar which was its capital, as a paramount sovereign.

Of the **geographical names** figuring in the inscription, Nalapura, the capital of the house, is evidently identical with Narwar in the Shivpurī District of Madhya Pradesh. **Babāḍō,** the donated village, cannot be identified for want of the required data. It is not known if it is represented by the modern village Barod, the name of which sounds somewhat similar to it and which is situated about 28 kms. south of Narwar.

² It is not known whether this sign of *avagraha,* as some others below, is actually engraved in the original or inserted by Hall in the transcript. The same remark may be made here about the use of the *anusvāra* and *parasavarṇa,* about doubling the consonant after *r* and about the correct use of sibilants *etc.* While calculating the corresponding Christian date in the *Ind. Ant.,* Vol. XIX, Kielhorn also remarked that Hall has changed the original *amāvāsyāṁ* to *amāvāsyāyāṁ* unnecessarily (p. 167, *n*). It is true that we get the *loc. sing.* form *amāvāsyāṁ* from the word *amāvāsī,* but in the absence of an  
³ The use of the word *pitṛi* before *mātṛi* may be justified by Pāṇini *sūtra Alpāchtaram* (II, ii, 34).  
⁴ As Hall remarked, the letters ![](sr139.JPG) are repeated in the original and are left unerased.  
⁵ In the original, ![](sr140.JPG) appears instead of![](sr141.JPG) as stated by Hall.
