**INSCRIPTIONS OF THE CHANDELLAS OF JEJAKABHUKTI**

The inscription is written in the **Nāgarī** alphabet of the 12th century. The initial *a* which occurs twice in *kōṭiā-* and *anēna,* both in l, 5, shows its form slightly different. Attention may also be invited to the initial *u* which has begun to assume the modern form ; see *rāüta-,* l. 3 ; to the loop of *k,* which, when it is the first member of a conjunct consonant or when the medial *ṛi* is attached to it, gives place to a horizontal stroke ; see *–bhikshē,* l. 6 and *kṛita-,* l. 8 ; the conjunct consonant gg appears as *gn,* as generally in the inscriptions of the time ; cf. *mārgga-,* l. 6 ; and lastly, the letter *r* is represented by a vertical with a slanting stroke attached to its middle on the left, as in *rāüta,* l. 3. *Orthographically* nothing is worth noting, except that a consonant following *r* is reduplicated in *mārgga-* and *durga-,* respectively in ll. 6 and 2. The *mātrās* of the dipthongs are all marked above.

The **language** of the record is Sanskrit and it is all in prose. It is full of errors, as will be shown in the foot-notes appended to the text that follows. The inscription has in it a number of local words also. The **purport** of the record is probably to commemorate the construction of a step-well *(bāüli,* l. 11)¹ by the *rāüta (rājaputra)* Śrī-Vīra,² the son of Tējala who was a Kshatriya of the village of Kōrṭiā, on the road, during the time of famine.

The **date** of the record, as expressed only in figures, is **Monday, the second day of the bright half of Āshāḍha** of the (Vikrama) year, which was read by Cunningham as 1237. But the impression before me shows the decimal figure more similar to two than three, and a careful scrutiny goes to indicate that the curve at the top of the figure has suffered from a slanting stroke which may have been either the original fault of the stone, or a redundant stroke of the chisel, or a later development due to weather or human agency, of course some time before Cunningham discovered the inscription. And here I agree with Kielhorn who took the figure to be 2. Thus according to him the year is 1227 ; and the date, as calculated by him, corresponds to **7th June, 1171 A.C.,** which was a **Monday.**³

The record purports to mention some more purposes also, as we can gather from the use of *–pādanaṁ,* appearing twice in ll. 6 and 8, and also from the expression *tadanantaraṁ cha,* after *kṛitaṁ* in l. 8. I am unable to make out this portion.

The inscription does not mention the name of the king, but he was evidently the illustrious **Paramardin** of the royal house of **Chandēllas** whom we know as occupying the throne from *c.* 1166 to 1202 A.C., and as is also shown by the provenance of the record. As already stated above, the rest of the record is unintelligible to me.

Of the **geographical places** mentioned in the inscription, **Jayapura** (l. 2) is the same as Ajayagaḍh ; and the village **Kōrṭiā** (l. 5) **I am** unable to identify.

¹ And not *nauli,* as read by Cunningham. He did not explain the word.  
² Here Cunningham read the name as *–Vēra,* but the impression shows the sign of the medial *i* very clearly. It is not known if the *Śrī* was a part of the name. ³ See *Ind. Ant.,* Vol. XIX, p. 357, No. 162. It may also be noted here that reading the year as 1237 and making his calculations according to it, Cunningham found that the day could not be worked out to be a Monday, as stated in the inscription, but a Wednesday ; and to solve this difficulty, he also observed that the word *sōmē,* in l. 2, may be a mistake of the writer or the engraver for *saumyē, i.e.,* Wednesday, as Budha is regarded to be the son of the Moon-deity (Cunningham, *op. cit.,* p. 50). This ingenious suggestion, however, goes against the poor knowledge of the writer and the engraver.  
⁴ From an impression.  
⁵ Expressed by a symbol.  
⁶ The sign marking this consonant is not cut in its proper place and appears as touching the top of the *mātrā of sō,* just below it in the next line. For the reading of the year that follows, see *n.* above.  
⁷ A redundant stroke makes this syllable appear as *dvi* or *ddhi.*  
⁸ It is probably the original fault of the stone that makes this letter appear as *bhō.* ⁹ The last of the verticals of the *mātrā* of *ā* is ornamental, resembling *ra.*
