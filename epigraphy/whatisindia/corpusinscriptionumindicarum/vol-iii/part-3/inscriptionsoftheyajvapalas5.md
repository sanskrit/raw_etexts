^(\[1\]) Read *sa ēsha* but it would not suit the metre. The consonant of the preceding letter was first engraved as *t* and later on corrected.  
^(\[2\]) The *daṇḍa* is to show the vocative case, addressing the king. ^(\[3\]) The preceding letter was originally engraved as pu and later on, the sign of the *mātrā* was erased, as can clearly be seen on the original.  
^(\[4\]) What appears as the sign of anusvāra on kshyā is the original fault of the stone.  
^(\[5\]) The figure of speech in this verse is metaphor, using expressions as are applicable to the name of the royal family, as well as to a lotus.  
^(\[6\]) The ends of the consonant of the preceding letter and the horizontal stroke are lined by a curve. Below, there are some other instances of the type, which are not noted separately.  
^(\[7\]) There is a redundant horizontal stroke at the end of the line.  
^(\[8\]) A *daṇḍa* was at first engraved after the bracketed letter and was subsequently scored off by a stroke.
