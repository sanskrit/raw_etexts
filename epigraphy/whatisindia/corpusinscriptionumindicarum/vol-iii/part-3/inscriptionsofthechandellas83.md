¹ The lacuna may conjecturally be filled in by ![](mc16.JPG).  
² Figure of speech : *Rūpaka.* The idea expressed in this stanza is apparently based on *Naishadhiyacharita.* Canto XII, v. 66.  
³ As already pointed out by Kielhorn, it is an allusion to Gautama’s other name Akshapāda.  
⁴ *Upadhā* means test of honesty. Cf. *Dharmōpadhābhir-viprānścha sarvābhiḥ sachivān punaḥ (Kālikē Purāṇ, 3).*  
⁵ *Trivarga is dharma* (virtue), *artha* (wealth) and *kāma* (pleasure), as also noted by Kielhorn. The idea expressed in this verse appears to have been borrowed from the *Śiśupāla-vadha,* II, 89.
