**INSCRIPTIONS OF THE YAJVAPALAS OF NARWAR**

![](118.JPG)

^(\[1\]) From an impression. It is No. 219 of *A. R. Ep., 1954-55, Appx* B.  
^(\[2\]) Expressed by symbol.  
^(\[3\]) The left limb of this akshara is not joined to the right, and the signs above the top-stroke are ornamentally treated.  
^(\[4\]) Sircar read the bracketed letter as tā which he corrected to *grā ;* but the space with some traces in it goes to show that the letter appears to have been actually cut as grā in the original.  
^(\[5\]) The *daṇḍa* is redundant, as also some others below.  
^(\[6\]) As also noted by Sircar, this is a variant of Chandēlla.  
^(\[7\]) The consonants of both these *aksharas* are so formed so as to make the word appear as ![](119.JPG),  
^(\[8\]) This expression also implies that the hero died in fighting. A slanting *daṇḍa* attached to the latter one indicates the end of the writing.  
^(\[9\]) From an impression which is No. 216 of A. R. *Ep., 1954-55, Appx.* B.  
^(\[10\]) Denoted by symbol.  
^(\[11\]) Read ![](120.JPG). The subscript of the bracketed letter is so formed as to appear as *l.* It is so in *-īśvara* in the next line also.  
^(\[12\]) The sign of *rēpha* has not come out on the impression but from the reverse it appears to have been incised.  
^(\[13\]) The sign of *mātrā* on *h* may have been incised on the original, as shown by a trace left there.  
^(\[14\]) The horizontal stroke, which distinguishes this letter from g, is not formed. The word *guru* that follows is used here to denote ‘the esteemed one’, and not a preceptor.  
^(\[15\]) As already noticed by Sircar, the first part of the name appears here and also in No. 176 as *Jaita,* in No. 165 as *Jayata,* and in No. 166 as *Jēyata.* The complete name appears to have been Jaitravarman and from the title *Mahākumāra,* he appears to have been the son of Gōpāladēva (?).  
^(\[16\]) All these three *aksharas* are mis-formed. The consonant of the first appears as *s*, the second may have been v, and that of the third is  
indefinite. And what follows is intended to denote the family name Yajvapala.
