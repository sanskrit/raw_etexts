**TEXT**^(\[1\])

^(\[1\]) From Plate xii-A in Cunningham’s *A. S. I. R.,* Vol. XXI.  
^(\[2\]) Expressed by a variant of the symbol.  
^(\[3\]) The *daṇḍa* here, as in some of the lines below, is used only to separate the names, as in some other records of the house.  
^(\[4\]) Cunningham read a superscript *r* on the penultimate letter in this line ; but in the plate it is missing on this letter, though in some other instances the *rēpha* is distinct *e.g.* in Nos. 128 and 137, in the fifth line of each.  
^(\[5\]) Cunningham read *annēna,* which gives no meaning here. What looks like the sign of *anusvāra* on a is merely a fault of the stone, or a scratch, when compared with the other marks throughout the inscription.  
^(\[6\]) That is, in sham-fight.  
^(\[7\]) Cunningham read *Sirothayena pralipādanam atam Bhadranantam,* which gives no meaning. He also translated a part of the expression as “built a (Sirotha ?)”. The meaning of this word is still not known, but the third case makes me inclined to suggest that it should be combined with anēna.  
^(\[8\]) The sign of the medial ē on the fourth letter in the name is probably intended for the preceding letter.  
^(\[9\]) The sign of anusvāra appears to have been wrongly put on this akshara. There should be a visarga, or the word should not have a vibhakti, as the others below. See the next n.  
^(\[10\]) As stated above, all the names in this line and below, appear without a case-ending and separated by a horizontal stroke.  
^(\[11\]) The last two letters in this line cannot be definitely made out, and here I follow Cunningham who took them one and read as given here.  
^(\[12\]) The first of the daṇḍas is joined to the preceding akshara, so as to look as the sign of medial ā.  
^(\[13\]) The meaning of this expression is not known. The reading too is not certain.  
^(\[14\]) As above. The reading of a is doubtful. Cunningham took it as vi but gave no sense.  
^(\[15\]) The third letter in this line appears more likely to be cha, followed by a daṇḍa ; but it gives no meaning.  
^(\[16\]) That is, Ṭhakkura.  
^(\[17\]) Possibly the second letter of the name is pa. for which compare da, the second akshara in l. 8, above.
