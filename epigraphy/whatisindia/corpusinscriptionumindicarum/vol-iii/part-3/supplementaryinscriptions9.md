**SUPPLEMENTARY INSCRIPTIONS**

present record. The verse has lost three *aksharas* at the end of l. 1 and six at the end of l. 2. It states that the stanzas were composed by Mahīpāla and were engraved by the illustrious Sthiradēva, who appears also to have been the engraver of the present record and whose name, as we have seen above, is lost at the end of l. 6.

Calling both these documents mentioned here as **A** and **B**, respectively, and connecting them with our No. 19, above, as our study of them enables us to do, we are inclined to suggest that they are all mutually connected and very probably are the parts of the same record engraved on separated slabs of stone and placed together. Thus the records were all composed by Mahīpāla, who is called a *Paṇḍita* in **B** and a son of Śṛiṅgavāsa in No. 19 ; and also that it was engraved by Sthiradēva, whose name is missing in No. 19, lost in **A** here, but can clearly be read in **B**.

Thus all the three records taken together go to show that Udayāditya gave his name to the place where he also excavated a tank and built the celebrated temple of Śiva.

^(\[5\]) The use of the plural shows that all the verses of No. 181 and of A and B, were engraved by the same person.  
^(\[6\]) The *daṇḍa* is engraved as a *mātrā*. The three *aksharas*, along with the six at the end of the next line, are now lost and are restored with the help of the illustrations.
