¹ The form of this letter is crude and the reading may also have been *–rma.*  
² C. correctly observed that the consonant of the second *akshara* of the name may have been *l.*  
³ The first of the bracketed letters is engraved as *pa,* and the *daṇḍa* is mingled with the letter that follows it.  
⁴ Some other *akshara* was originally engraved here.  
⁵ C. read the first *akshara* of the name as *sa,* but the *mātrā* is distinct.  
⁶ See *n.* 9 in line 100 above.  
⁷ The consonant of the bracketed *akshara* is cut as *v.*  
⁸ Originally *tri-,* with the consonant changed to *dv.*  
⁹ As also noted by C., the bracketed letter is crudely formed and appears like *tta.*  
¹⁰ That is, in aggregation. C., however, proposes to correct the word to *samāṁśatvē,* in the ‘sense of equal share.  
¹¹ Read ![](ns11.JPG).  
¹² The *akshara* in the bracketed looks like *ka.*  
¹³ The reading of this *akshara* is uncertain and the name that precedes it is rather curious. Is *Badarīśa,* intended ?  
¹⁴ Here and below in all such cases read either *–śarmmā* or *–śarman,* as required by grammar.  
¹⁵ It cannot be ascertained whether a curve of the medial long *ī* is above *ṇa.*
