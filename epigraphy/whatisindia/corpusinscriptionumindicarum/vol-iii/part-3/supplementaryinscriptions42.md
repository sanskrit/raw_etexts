^(\[1\]) Both the bracketed *aksharas* are engraved only in parts.  
^(\[2\]) The three *aksharas* in the brackets show uncouth forms.  
^(\[3\]) That is, 77, mentioned here in Prakrit. For the Prakritism in the expression, cf. bayāsa (Sans. *duāchatvāriṁśat*) in the Kamauli plate of V.S. 1190, in Ep. Ind., Vol. IV, pp. 111-112.  
^(\[4\]) Originally, a daṇḍa, with an attempt to change it to the sign of visarga. Nibaddha means registered. Cf. Ep. Ind., Vol. XIX, p. 18, l. 16. The reading of the two preceding letters in the brackets, is not certain.  
^(\[5\]) The sense of this and the preceding word is not clear to me. The reading of the first two of these aksharas is also uncertain.  
^(\[6\]) This is grammatically incorrect. Read ![](srs94.JPG). Obviously, the same villages which were donated previously. The daṇḍa in the preceding line is redundant.  
^(\[7\]) The akshara in the brackets is written above the line, in smaller form.  
^(\[8\]) Read ![](srs95.JPG).  
^(\[9\]) Read ![](srs96.JPG)  
^(\[10\]) This is a contraction of *Dūtaka.* The consonant of hi that follows is engraved as d.  
^(\[11\]) Delete the daṇḍa, and read both the names as one word.
