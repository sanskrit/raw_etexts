KHAJURĀHŌ STONE IMAGE INSCRIPTION OF THE TIME OF MADANAVARMAN

\[ Vikrama \] Year 1215

THIS inscription was discovered by Sir A. Cunningham and was first brought to notice by him in his *Annual Reports of the Archaeological Survey of India Vol. II* (1862-65), p 435. He also published its transcript and a specimen of letters employed in it, in *ibid.,* Vol. XXI (for 1883-84 and 1884-85), p. 61, and Pl. xx-D. The inscription was then edited by Kielhorn in the *Epigraphia Indica,* Vol. I (1888), pp. 152 f., where he gave his own reading of the text from an impression supplied by the late Dr. Burgess. But the article is not illustrated. The inscription is edited here from an impression placed at my disposal by the Chief Epigraphist for India.⁸

The inscription is incised on the top of the pedestal of a colossal stone image, seated, of the third Jaina pontiff Saṁbhavanātha, in a small ancient Jaina temple dedicated to Ādinātha at Khajurāhō⁹ in the Chhatarpur District of the Bundelkhand region of Madhya Pradesh .The record consists of a single line divided into two parts by a boss showing the seated figure of a horse,¹⁰ to right, in a rectangle of a beaded border, with a petal-like object on either side, the whole design occupying a space 6 cms. broad by 3∙5 cms. high. The first part of the writing measures 48∙8 cms. and the second 43∙4 cms. The average size of the letters is 1 cm. The inscription is in a good state of preservation.

The **characters** belong to the twelfth century A.C., and are precisely of the same type as to be found in the Chandēlla inscriptions of the age. What is worth noting in this respect is that the form of *dh* is devoid of the horn on its left limb, as in *sādhu,* and the form of the subscript *r* is complete, with the former member of the conjunct half-drawn, of which *tat-putra-*is the only instance and *prabhṛiti* is a probable exception. The medial short *u* attached to *r* has the same form as when attached to other letters ; cf. *–ruha,* and this consonant, appearing all the three times in the end, shows a loop with a wedge attached to it.

The **language** is incorrect Sanskrit and the inscription is in prose. In respect of **orthography,** we note the use of *s* for *ś,* only in one instance *(-vaṁsē-),* the doubling of a consonant following *r,* as in *–varmma-,* the medial *ē* denoted both by the *pṛishṭha-* and the *ūrdhvamātrā,* the  
wrong use of an *anusvāra* in the end, and lastly, the use of the local element in the name *Sirichandra* for *Śrī-Chandra.*

2 The symbol appears as the letter *dh,* and almost resembles the one in No. 117.  
3 What is intended is ![](lexus3.JPG), as it figures in No. 190, l. I.

5 The last two *aksharas* also appear to form a name as some others in this inscription. All the names are without the case-endings.  
6 This is, ![](lexus5.JPG).  
7 There is an ornamentation between the double *daṇḍas,* and a couch after the figures showing the *tithi.* 8 His No. C-1742 of *A. R. Ep.* for 1962-63.  
9 For the location and archaeological importance of this place, see No. 97, above.  
10 This is the *lāñchhana* of Sambhavanātha.
