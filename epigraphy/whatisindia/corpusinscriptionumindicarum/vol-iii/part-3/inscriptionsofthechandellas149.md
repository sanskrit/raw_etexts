**INSCRIPTIONS OF THE CHANDELLAS OF JEJAKABHUKTI**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
¹ Here is the end of a verse in *Sragdharā.*  
² A part of a verse in *Śārdūlavikrīḍita.*  
³ As above. The same metre in the next verse also, which is numbered 25 by Maisey in his transcript.  
⁴ Metre of this and the next verse: *Sragdharā.* This verse uses such expressions as are applicable to the enemies of the king and also to the bird known as *sārikā.*  
⁵ Here Maisey’s reading is evidently wrong, as this word has three letters whereas the metre requires only two, the first of which has to be short and the second to be long.  
⁶ Metre of this and of the next verse : *Śārdūlavikrīḍita.* There is a play on the word *khaṇḍita.* The expressions used in this verse apply to *kāminīs,* as also to the enemies of the king. In the first case the second word of the third foot means *charaṇa, i.e.,* foot, and in the second, *i.e.,* in case of the enemies, *cha* has to be separated from *raṇa, i.e.,* battle.  
⁷ Metre: *Vasantatilakā.*  
⁸ Metre: *Anushṭubh.*  
⁹ Metre: *Vasantatilakā.*  
¹⁰ Metre: *Śārdūlavikrīḍita.*  
¹¹ Metre: *Mālinī.* It is doubtful whether all the verses of this inscription were composed by Paramardin himself. The latter part of it contains his own eulogy, but from one of these verses we also learn that it is a eulogy of Purāri, though the expressions such as *dēva* are applicable to the king, suggest that the latter part was composed by some other person, probably the engraver, for whom we find only the word *ullilēkha,* meaning wrote on the stone (also). Under the circumstances the point cannot be decided.  
¹² The year of the date is wrongly given for 1258, as Kielhorn has already drawn our attention to in *Ind. Ant.,* Vol. XIX, p. 354. Similarly, he has also remarked that the corresponding date is stated to be, in *A. S. I.,* Vol. XXI, p. 38, the 28th October, which is evidently a misprint.
