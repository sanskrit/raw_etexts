**INSCRIPTIONS OF THE CHANDELLAS OF JEJAKABHUKTI**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
¹ The letter in the brackets is perhaps originally *ś,* later on changed to *s*, with an unsuccessful attempt.  
² The consonant of the *akshara* in brackets appears as *ch.*  
³ The *kula-parvatas* (seven mountain ranges) are well-known. See *Mark purāṇa (Bid-Indica series),* p. 284.  
⁴ The horizontal stroke distinguishing this letter from *ga* is not marked.  
⁵ In the latter part of this line a number of the *anusvāra-signs* have been cut so shallow that they are not distinct in the impressions.  
⁶ This syllable is not properly formed, and the *mātrā* of ji that follows is mutilated. But the reading is certain. The missing five aksharas at the end of this line may be conjecturally restored to be *.dhūli- pratānar-diśaḥ.*  
⁷ The stroke partly visible in the end of this line is probably the curve of *ka* and not the sign of medial *ā* ; and *kt* is probably intended.  
⁸ The slanting stroke of this letter distinguishing it from *p* is not marked.  
⁹ The space for the sign of medial *ā* is blank in the impressions.  
¹⁰ The *mātrā* above this letter is probably placed above the preceding letter.  
¹¹ The bracketed letter appears as *sa.*  
¹² The original has *nā* which Mirashi suggests to be taken as *nāṁ ;* but to me it appears to have been *nō,* forming an adjective of *marutaḥ.*  
¹³ The bracketed *akshara* looks like *tra.* Probably *chalita* may have been intended here.  
¹⁴ The *mātrā* of the first *ka* is partially visible and of the second, it is completely lost. For the idea expressed in this verse cf. *Naishadhīya-Charita,* Canto VI, v. 27.  
¹⁵ This verse also appears in No. 60, v. 53, which is a Paramāra grant.  
¹⁶ Mirashi read these two *aksharas* as *dhamma (rmma),* but the first of them has a top-stroke, unlike that of *dh* and the second has a point, and not a loop as of*m* in the left limb. Besides, his reading does not give any sense which may be applicable here.
