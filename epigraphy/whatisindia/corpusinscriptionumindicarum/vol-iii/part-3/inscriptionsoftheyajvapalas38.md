\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
¹ The consonant of this *akshara* has totally disappeared.  
² Gramatically singular is required here. Drop the sign of *visarga.*  
³ The sign of *anusvāra,* which was originally put on this *akshara,* was later on erased on the stone, but the mark of it still exists.  
⁴ This *akshara* was first omitted and was engraved in a very small size just above the line. The *mātrā* in *mi* that follows *(bhūmī-)* is lengthened *metris causa.* The dot on (Sanskrit) is a fault on the stone.  
⁵ And not *cha=Adhigadēva,* as originally read by Hirananda Śāstrī and was followed later on. This was first corrected by Dr. Sircar in I.H.Q., Vol. XXXII, p. 399.  
⁶ This *akshara* is mutilated.  
⁷ As above.  
⁸ *Chachan* is the colloquial form of Chāchiga, mentioned above in v. 13.  
9 On the correct form on the name, see n. in No. 175, above.  
10 This line is engraved on the lower panel of the stone. The *aksharas* in the brackets are mutilated and the *sandhi* in the end, if the reading is corrected, is wrong. But the reading is not certain. Sircar read these *aksharas as kama \[tha\]isaddhā* taking them as two names, *Kamaṭhāi* and Saddha.
