¹ This and the preceding *akshara* which were originally omitted were subsequently written in a smaller form below the line.  
² Above *mā,* there appears to have been the sign of *anusvāra,* which was engraved at first and second off later on.  
³ This *akshara* is engraved as *shṭha.*  
⁴ What is intended here is *Śrīvāstavya* which would not suit the metre.  
⁵ The use of this word is not befitting here. Recast as ![](rd11.JPG).  
⁶ Srivastava read![](rd12.JPG) : but I agree with Prinsep in my reading. The matra on *va* is faintly visible and the last of these *aksharas,* thought misformed, looks more like *ndraḥ* than *ndhuḥ.* The reading also suits the metre.  
⁷ This letter has left only traces and it was read by Srivastava as *shu,* following Prinsep, but *shāṁ* may also be equally possible.  
⁸ The *daṇḍas* are redundant and the *visarga* on *ya* is doubtful. Read . In the latter half of this verse the correction is made in view of the metre but grammatically it is wrong.![](rd13.JPG)  
⁹ Perhaps ![](rd14.JPG) is intended.
