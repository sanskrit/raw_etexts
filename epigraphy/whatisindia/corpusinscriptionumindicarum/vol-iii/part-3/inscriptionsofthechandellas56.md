^(\[1\]) Both the signs for the *visarga* are hollow rectangular marks, as also in the beginning of l. 28, below.  
^(\[2\]) This is a mythical range of mountains round the world. The Sun and the moon move along on side of it.  
^(\[3\]) The first *akshara* of the name is almost mixed with the preceding one.  
^(\[4\]) For ![](god20.JPG): which, of course, would not suit the metre.

^(\[5\]) The fabulous mountain round which the planets are said to revolve; it is also said to consist of gold, and thus the idea well suits the description of *kalaśa* made of *kaladhauta, i.e.,* gold.  
^(\[6\]) The bracketed *akshara* has no top-stroke and thus it appears as *dh. Tulā-purusha* used in the same verse (or *tulā-dāna*) means the gift to a Brāhmaṇa (or, Brāhmaṇas) as much gold, jewels or other valu- able things as equal of the weight of one’s body. For this *mahādāna* see Hēmādri’s *Chaturvarga- chintāmaṇi,* (Banaras edn.). I, p. 175.  
^(\[7\]) The sign of *visarga* was originally incised but later on struck off. For the six duties of a *Brāhmaṇa,* see M. S. Ch. X. v. 75.  
^(\[8\]) The sign of *anusvāra* is cut before the curve.  
^(\[9\]) *Sandhi* is not made here, as it is optional.  
^(\[10\]) As *n.* 50, above.  
^(\[11\]) The first of the bracketed letters is rather peculiarly formed and the second appears to be corrected from *ta,* which was originally incised.  
^(\[12\]) The sign of the *visarga* was incised subsequently, as the upper dot is above the line and the lower one for below.
