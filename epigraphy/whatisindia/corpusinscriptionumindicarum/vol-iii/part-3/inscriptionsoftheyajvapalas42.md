^(\[1\]) This syllable is supplied *metris causa.*  
^(\[2\]) An unnecessary *anusvāra* above ![](snm7.JPG) was rubbed off by the engraver.  
^(\[3\]) There is an unnecessary mark above ![](snm8.JPG) The sign of *visarga* at the end of the verse appears to have been engraved in course of revision.  
^(\[4\]) Sarkar read the first *akshara* of the name as ![](snm9.JPG) but the sign of its *mātrā* appears to have been Chiselled off.  
^(\[5\]) This letter appears as chi as the vertical stroke that follows is placed close to it and a curve is also engraved above by way of ornamentation. The last *akshara* in this line is misformed ; or it may have been ![](snm9.JPG) as Sircar actually read it.  
^(\[6\]) These three *aksharas* are abraded.  
^(\[7\]) The superscript is wrongly engraved as bh.  
^(\[8\]) This *akshara* is superfluous. On the stone it also appears to have been cancelled.
