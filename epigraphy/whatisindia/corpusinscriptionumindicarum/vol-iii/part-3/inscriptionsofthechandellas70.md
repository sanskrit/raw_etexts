**INSCRIPTIONS OF THE CHANDELLAS OF JEJAKABHUKTI**

^(\[1\]) Sircar read the letter in the brackets as pdh and then corrected it to bdh. This form of bdh, however, began to appear in the inscriptions of this dynasty only slightly earlier, for which see babhūva in l. 6 of No. 111, where it shows a slight variation from p.  
^(\[2\]) See the preceding n.  
^(\[3\]) The superscript of this akshara has faintly come out. The consonant of the preceding vi is cut as ch.  
^(\[4\]) As n. 9 on the previous page. It would be better to read ![](jen13.JPG), as suggested by Sircar. Mitra read the letters as Vakshata-, but they give no meaning. See E. R. K., p. 227, No. 20. as Vakshata-, but they give no meaning. See E. R. K., p. 227, No. 20.  
^(\[5\]) The reading of the akshara in brackets is doubtful. It also appears as ṭa. The same akshara which is a part of a name, is incised as ha in l. 26 below. It may also be noted that in this and the other lines giving the names, etc., sandhi is not made.  
^(\[6\]) Sircar read the name as paṇikavaḍa, but both the last of the aksharas are clear, bh resembling t and the second ![](jen14.JPG) showing a bend like d with the subscript r. Read also ![](jen15.JPG)-.  
^(\[7\]) The reading of va is not certain as it also resembles cha. The punctuation marks in this and the next two lines are redundant.
