**INSCRIPTIONS OF THE CHANDELLAS OF JEJAKABHUKTI**

**KĀLAÑJAR STONE INSCRIPTION OF PARAMARDIDĒVA**

¹ The whole of the latter half of this verse is lost.  
² After the end of the first half of the verse, Maisey read :![](nitro29.JPG), which is in fact the end of the next verse. Thus he has mingled parts of two verses and gave the reading continuously, not even putting the punctuation marks. His reading therefore is not helpful, and, as stated above, the impression too is indistinct at several places.  
³ The letters in the brackets are lost on the original due to flaking off on the stone, and have been adopted from Maisey’s reading  
⁴ Maisey read the last *aksharas* of this verse as ![](nitro30.JPG); but they are indistinct in the impression. Here too he wrote all his reading continuously without showing the breaks, and thus it all becomes unintelligible.  
⁵ Maisey read![](nitro31.JPG), but the consonant *v* is distinct in the impression. The first two letters in this line are lost in the original and have been adopted from his reading. Moreover, leaving these 14 *aksharas,* the whole verse is lost, as can be calculated from the space in the impression.  
⁶ These four *aksharas,* which are lost in the original due to flaking, have been adopted from Maisey’s reading.  
⁷ Much of this verse is lost, as also of the following two verses. That they were two is known from the space in the impression.  
⁸ The impression being very indistinct for the remaining portion of the inscription, I am obliged to give Maisey’s transcript which does not show the exact portions lost, or those which he was unable to read at places. His transcript is not line by line, though I have retained it. The minor corrections made in brackets are mine, and in the rest the numbers of verses could not be followed due to lacuna.  
⁹ Insert a double *daṇḍa* here, as it appears to be the last foot of a verse in *Śārdūlavikrīḍita.* The preceding line is obviously disconnected with it.  
¹⁰ Metre : *Sragdharā,* which appears to end here. Maisey’s reading of this verse is again full of omissions, as in some other cases also, below, which are not separately noted, every time.
