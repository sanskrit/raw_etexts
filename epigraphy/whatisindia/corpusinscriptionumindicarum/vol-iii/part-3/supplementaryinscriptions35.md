**SUPPLEMENTARY INSCRIPTIONS**

Madanavarman. But since the last year of this ruler is well known to be 1202 A.C., and we also know that after the reign of Hammīravarman the region was conquered by the Mohammedans in *circa* 1308 and in view of the date of the present record, we have to presume that there was a second king of the name Paramardin, whose existence we do not know from any other source. This view, however, appears to be less possible, in view of the fact that the region was then annexed by Alā-ud-dīn. Thus this point remains uncertain till we get fresh material to solve it.

**Rajavasini,** the place mentioned as the king’s residence, is Rāsin itself, where the record was found.

No. 197 ; PLATE CLXXIII  
**MAKĀVAL STONE INSCRIPTION OF THE TIME OF DHĀRĀVARSHA**  
\[ Vikrama \] Year 1276 \_

THIS inscription was discovered by V. S. Sukthankar, then an Assistant Superintendant in the Archaeological Survey of India, in 1916-17, and its date was noticed by him in the *Progress Reports of the Western Circle* for that year, on page 69. It is edited here for the first time from an inked impression supplied by the Superintending Archaeologist of the Western Circle.

The epigraph is incised on the base of a column of stone pertaining to a temple on the western bank of a small tank, about 1 km. north-east of the village of **Makāval,** in the Rēodhar *tehsīl* of the Sirōhī District in Rājasthān. The place is about 8 kms. straight south of Rēodhar and about 25 kms. west-northwest of Ābū Road.

The writing is in a sunken panel and covers a space about 19 cms. broad by 18.5 cms. high, and consists of ten lines. It has suffered a good deal owing to exposure. The portion on the left-hand side is almost completely obliterated and only an akshara here and another there is now visible ; whereas that on the right-hand side, which has suffered less, cannot be completely read. But the record is of interest, as we shall see presently.
