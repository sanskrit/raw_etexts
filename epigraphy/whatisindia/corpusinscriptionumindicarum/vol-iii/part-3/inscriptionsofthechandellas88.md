**INSCRIPTIONS OF THE CHANDELLAS OF JEJAKABHUKTI**

SĒMRĀ COPPER-PLATE GRANT OF PARAMARDIDĒVA

January, and was visible all over India.¹ Thus the reckoning was according to the *pūrṇimānta* month, but according to it, the week-day was Wednesday. The date of the grant confirmed by Paramardin is stated in figures only ; it was **7th of the bright half of Vaiśākha, Thursday, 1223 of the (Vikrama) era,** which, following the southern *expired* year, regularly corresponds to **27th of April, 1167 A. C.**²

After the auspicious symbol followed by the verse eulogising the royal Chandēlla house and generally occuring at the commencement of the inscriptions of the house, the present grant gives the pedigree of the donor, introducing the *Paramabhaṭṭāraka, Mahārājādhirāja,* and *Paramēśvara,* the illustrious **Pṛithvīvarman,** his successor, the illustrious *P.M.P.,* **Madanavarman,** and the latter’s successor, the illustrious *P.M.P.* **Paramardidēva,** and says that he was a devout worshipper of Śiva, and the sole lord of Kālañjara. Then, we have a verse which conventionally glorifies Paramardin and states that he excelled Cupid by his handsome form, the ocean by depth (soberness), the Sun by his lustre, Bṛihaspati by his wisdom and Yudhishṭhira by his truthfulness. This verse is an exact copy of the one occurring in the corresponding portion of Madanavarman’s Bhārat-Kalā-Bhavan grant.³ With reference to the genealogy occuring in the present grant, we have to observe that the names of the first two of the rulers mentioned here are already known from the other records of the house, and the present inscription supplements our knowledge by stating that Paramardin was the grandson of Madanavarman.⁴ The latter’s son was **Yaśōvarman,** whose name occurs only in the Baṭēśvara stone inscription of Paramardin ; and whether he ruled or not will be seen while dealing with that inscription where there is a proper place for it.

The necessity for Paramardin to confirm the grant which was made by his grandfather Mahanavarman in V.S. 1219, suggests that latter may have died soon after the grant was made and it could not possibly be stabilized. Indeed, we have no record to show Madanavarman’s name after this date. And the suggestion made here receives a strong corroboration from the fact that Madanavarman’s last known year is V.S. 1220 or 1163 A.C. ;⁵ and during his last days his attention may have been constantly required in driving off the Chaulukya army which under Jayasiṁha Siddharāja (1094-1143 A.C.) had already annexed the Paramāra dominions and began to invade the territories of the Chandēllas, as we have already seen in the political history of the house.⁶

**The villages** which were donated are mentioned in 11. 7 ff. They are: (1) In the district *(vishaya)* of Vikraura. Khaṭauḍā-12. Ṭāṇṭa-12, belonging to Rālha, and Hāṭa-18, and Sēsayi-grāma. (2) In the district *(vishaya)* of Dudhai, Pilikhiṇi*-pañchēla* (group of five ?) and Iṭāva*-pañchēla.* (3) In the district *(vishaya)* of Vaḍavāri, Isarahara-pañchēla,Uladaṇa and Kakaradaha. (4) In Gōkula (?), Hathidahā 11. 7-8.

The mention of the procedure of sanctioning the grant begins in 1. 10 ; it is all common, as stated in the other grants of the house and need not be repeated here. It is also stated here that the king donated all these villages with the exception of the following : ─ The town of Madanapura and the ground belonging thereto, *(viz.,)* Gaḍḍarakula, and the glorious deity Sōmanātha, further, the village of Vaḍavāri and Dudhai, the property belonging to Liṅgiā and Jalhuā connected with the town of Mahanapura, and also a plot of land in it, measuring four ploughs which is the property of the Laṭiās and is connected with the Ajayasāgar (ll. 11-12).

The **donees** are mentioned in ll. 17 ff. Their total number was 309 and they had immigrated from the various *agrahāras* of learned persons *(bhaṭṭāgrahāra)* and belonged to the various
