^(\[1\]) From impressions supplied by the Chief Epigraphist and also from Photozincographs (Plate xxxiii) in Cunningham’s A. S. I., A. R. Vol. X. Cunningham’s number of the inscriptions is given here in brackets, where the letter C denotes Cunningham.  
² *Sandhi* is not observed here and below in similar cases.  
³ Kielhorn read this letter as ![](tweteen.JPG), but what he took to be the subscript (Sanskrit) appears to me only a scratch, as can be seen also above this  
letter and below those that precedes and follows it. This portion is damaged and we cannot be certain about the existence of the subscript.  
⁴ What appears as an *anusvāra* above ![](twteone.JPG) is only a defect in the stone.  
⁵ The word ![](twthre.JPG) ‘belonging to’ is used to express the meaning of the possessive case in contemporary inscriptions; but, as Kielhorn has  
rightly observed, it is redundant here since the name that precedes this word is already included in that case.
