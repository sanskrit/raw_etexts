**INTRODUCTION**

Â§6. Treatment of the vowel *ā :* This vowel suffers most changes, though it is not infrequent to find it well preserved. It is principally changed to *a* before a consonant cluster, before the gen. sg. fem. term., at the end of the word mostly in nom. sg. fem. and abl. sg. mas., and lastly it is represented as a short vowel in some cases mostly due to the negligence of the scribe and should in fact be taken to stand for a long vowel in such cases.

> \(I\) Change *ā\>a* before a consonant cluster :  
> Sk. *ārya─\> aya-* A 38, A 51, A 56 etc.  
> Sk. *rājya─\>raja─* A 1, A 2. (It may be observed that in the
> inscription A 1 long *ā* is preserved in *Gāgiputa─ and
> Vāchhiputa─.)*  
> Sk. *bhāryā─\>bhaya-ye* A 4.  
> Sk. *Kāśyapa─\>Kasapa-* B 17.  
> This change is also observed before clusters with nasals :  
> Sk. *sūtrāntika─\>sutaṁtika-* A 51.  
> Sk. *upakrānti-(?)\>ūkraṁti-* B 19 \[cf. § 2 (II)\].  
> Sk. *vyavakrānta-(?)\>vokata-* B 18.  
> Sk. *brāhmaṇa─\>bramana-* B 51.  
> Sk. *rājñaḥ\> raño* A 1. (But cf *rāño* A 4. We also get long *ā* in
> *rājano* A 3 and short a in rajano A 130, where we have to suppose
> that the gen. sg. forms are formed on the analogy of such forms as
> *attano* etc.)  
> Sk. *ātmanā\>atanā* A 112.  
> Sk. *āmravat (a)─\>Aboda-* B 69.  
> (II) Change *ā*\>a before the gen. (abl.) sg. fem. termination. It is
> observed before the term. *–ya* and sometimes before –*ye,* but never
> before *–yā.* Sk. *Pushyadevā─\>Pusadeva-ya* A 120.  
> Sk. *bhāryā─\> bhāriya-ya* A 46. Also cf. *Purikaya A 17,
> Purikayā*[^(\[1\])](introduct8.html#_ftn1) A 19 (in these two cases
> abl. sg. term.), *Badhikaya* A 42, *Nadutaraya* A 119, and
> *Nagarikaya* A 43.  
> *Sk. Pushyadattā─\>Pusadata-ye* A 43, A 44.  
> Sk. *Nāgā─\>Naga-ye* A 74. Also cf. *Kamūchulaye* A 54 b, *Bhutaye* A
> 77, and *Sapagutaye* A 78. [^(\[2\])](introduct8.html#_ftn2)

 As against these instances we have numerous instances where *ā* is preserved before*-ya* and *-ye;* *cf.* the following : *Nāgasenāya* A 14, *Purikāya* A 16 (abl.sg.), *Idadevāya* A 19, A 45, *Sāmāya A 20, Bhojakaṭakāya* A 24, *Benākaṭikāya* A 49 a, *bhāriyāya* A 115, *Sonāya* A 123 etc. etc. ; before –*ye cf. Nāgarakhitāye* A 4, *nāgarikāye* A 44, *Phagudevāye* A 75, *Ujhikāye* A 114, *Ghosāye* A 117 etc.

 As mentioned above *ā* is never shown as *a* before the ending –*yā;* cf. *Kujarāyā* A 10, *Nāgadevāyā* A 11, *samanāyā* A 12, *Purikāyā* (abl. sg. ) A 18, A 20, *Pusāyā* A 27, *Nāgilāyā* A 29, *Sirimāyā* A 48 etc. etc.

> \(III\) Change ─*ā\>─a* at the end of a word :  
> (a) At the end of nom. sg. fem. words ; cf. *devata* B 8, 12,
> *Sudasana* B 10.  
> *Mahakoka* B 12, *Idasālaguha* B 35, *Sivala* B 56, ─*Chitupādasila* B
> 67.  
> (b) Also in the acc. sg. fem. with or without the loss of final
> anusvāra ; cf. *disa* B 26, *katha* *( kanthā* acc. to Lüder^(S) ) B
> 73, *dakhinaṁ* B 26.

[^(\[1\])](introduct8.html#_ftnref1)Perhaps this is a mistake for *Purikāya* (cf. A 16) or *Purikāyā* (cf. A 18, A 20), as we do not get any other instance of the shortening of ─*ā* before ─*yā.*  
[^(\[2\])](introduct8.html#_ftnref2)In A 24 we get *Diganagay\[e\].* It will be seen that the final vowel stroke is not quite clear. At other places in this inscription we get the gen. sg. term. ─*ya* in *Bhojakaṭakāya* and *bhichhuniya* and not*-ye. Na\[ṁ\]d\[i\]nagarikaya* A 45 may be a mistake for *─kāya,* because in the same inscription we get *Idadevāya; and bhayaye* A 4 may be a mistake for *bhayāye,* as we have *Nāgarakhitāye* in the same inscription.
