**PART B**

reading is very uncertain─on the photograph only ma can be made out clearly─, and the medallion represents evidently two men engaged in a wrestling match. The explanation as *chaṅkama* has been given up by Barua later on, and replaced by another one, not less queer. In Barh. II, p. 171, he explains the medallion as showing two men lying on the ground embracing each other, placing neck upon neck, and intertwining their upper legs. The background is filled with a number of lotus flowers. According to Barua these are snowflakes which signify that the men are sleeping on a snowy ground and embracing each other as a means of putting off the cold. ‘The scene, as it is, betrays only a decorative purposeâ€™. I think it unnecessary to add any comments.
