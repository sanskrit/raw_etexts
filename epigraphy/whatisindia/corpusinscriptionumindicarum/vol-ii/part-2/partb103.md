**PART B**

a relief which illustrates an event on Mount Naḍoda. The only word in the inscription which presents any difficulty is *katha,* which may denote either the object which is milked or the substance which is milked from it. Hultzsch states that Bühler wanted to explain it as *kvātha* ‘ decoction ’. According to Pāniṇi 3, 1, 140, besides *kvātha* there existed in the same meaning also *kvatha,* and we may agree that *katha* may stand for *kvathaṁ* and, if necessary, also for *kvāthaṁ.* But the sense so obtained is hardly satisfactory. Hultzsch proposed to take *katha* as a graphical or dialectal variant of *kaṭha (kāshṭha)* ‘ wood ’. I am ready to admit that owing to the negligence of a mason, who forgot to put the dot in the centre of the letter, a *tha* may occasionally appear as *ṭha,* but the superfluous addition of a dot in writing *katha* for *kaṭha,* as Hultzsch’s suggestion implies, is highly improbable, and the derivation of *katha (with dental th=kattha)* from *kāshṭha* is phonetically impossible. Moreover the milking of a piece of wood would not agree with the sculpture. There can be little doubt that the thing *(katha)* which *Veḍuka* is milking is an object hanging down from the tree which is certainly neither a piece of wood nor a bhisti’s *mashak* as suggested by Hoernle. What it is meant for will be understood at once, if we remember that the *anusvāra* is frequently not written in these inscriptions and that therefore *katha* may be an imperfect spelling for *kaṁthaṁ. Kanthā* is the garment of a religious mendicant together with hundreds of rags; cf. Bhartṛihari 3, 19 ; *vastraṁ cha jīṇaśatakhaṇḍamayī cha kanthā ; 3, 74 jīrṇā kanthā tataḥ kīm ; 3.86 rathyākshīṇaviśīrṇajīṇavasanaiḥ saṁprāptakanthāsakhaḥ ; 3, 101 kaupīnaṁ śatakhaṇḍajarjarataraṁ kanthā punas tādṛiśī; śāntiś. 4, 20 dhṛitajaratkanthālavasya. In Śāntiś.* 4, 4 the garment of a forest recluse is said to be pieced up with withered leaves; *jīrṇapalāśasaṁhatikṛitāṁ[^(\[1\])](partb103.html#_f%0Atn1) kanthām vasāno* *vane. Mahāv.* 8, 12 we are told that Ānanda made garments from rags *(chhinnaka)* having the appearance of fields of rice in Magadha *(Magadhakhetta)* with their manifold boundaries. Exactly in the same way the artists has represented the *kantha.*

 The story of Veḍuka’s milking has not yet been identified. It belongs to the circle of legend gathered round Mount Naḍoda which form the subject also of the sculpture referred to under Nos. B 70, B 72, B 74, B 75, B 76, B 81.

The rose-apple tree on Mount Naḍoda.

On the left side of the sculpture there is a tree from which two human hands emerge, one holding a bowl filled with food, while the other is pouring out water from a vessel, resembling a tea-pot, upon the right hand of a man sitting on a *mōṛhā,* or wicker stool. We know from the medallion illustrating the gift of the Jetavana and other sculptures that vessels of that peculiar form *(bhiṅkāra)* were used in the ceremony of pouring the water of donation on the hand of the donee; the scene therefore evidently represents the gift of food to
