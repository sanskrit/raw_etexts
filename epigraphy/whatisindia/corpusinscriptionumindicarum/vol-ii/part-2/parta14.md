**PART A**

 *Dhanabhutisa.* In the latter case, we should, of course, have to assume that it was due to mere chance that he had a mother of the same *gotra* as the Dhanabhūti of Bhārhut, their identify being precluded by the script of their records. There is absolutely no reason why *bhutisa* should be restored as *Dhanabhutisa,* names ending in *bhuti* being very frequent in this time.

 The term *ratnagṛiha* seems to denote a Stūpa. The term P. *parisā, Sk. Parishad* is used also in the Pāli Canon and in the scriptures of the Sarvāstivādins with reference to the division of the Buddhist Order into *bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, upāsakas* and *upasikas.*

**A 2 (688); PLATE XXIII**

FRAGMENTARY inscription on a pillar of a gateway, now at Batanmāra. Edited by Cunningham, *StBh.* (1879), p. 128, No. 2 and Pl. LIII ; Barua-Sinha, BI. (1926), p. 3, No. 2.

**TEXT:**

**TRANSLATION:**

During the reign of the Sugas *(Śuṅgas)*[^(\[2\])](parta14.html#_f%0Atn2) ……..Āgaraju *(Aṅgāradyat?)*[^(\[2\])](parta14.html#_f%0Atn2) …………the gatewayâ€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦

 The text of the inscription was probably the same as that of No. A 1. Another fragmentary toraṇa-inscription is No. A 129.

**A 3 (869)[^(\[3\])](parta14.html#_f%0Atn3); PLATE XXIII**

 RAIL inscription. Edited by Cunningham, *PASB.* 1874, p. 116; Cunningham *StBh*. (1879), p. 142, No. 54 and Pl. LVI ; Hultzsch, *ɀDNG.,* Vol. XL (1886), p. 60; and *IA.,* Vol. XXI (1829)¸ p. (1892), p. 225 ; Barua-Sinha, BI. (1926), p. 30, No. 103 ; Barua, *Barh.* *I,* p. 42.

**TEXT:**

Dhanabhutisa rājano putasa kamārasa[^(\[4\])](parta14.html#_f%0Atn4) Vādhapālasa \[dānaṁ\]

**TRANSLATION:**

 (Gift) of prince Vādhapāla *(Vyādhapāla)*,[^(\[5\])](parta14.html#_f%0Atn5) the son of king Dhanabhūti. Dhanabhūti is already known as the donor of the ‘toraṇa’ mentioned in A 1. There he is not referred to as ‘king’ as he is in our inscription ; in A 1, however, his grandfather bears that title.

[^(\[1\])](parta14.html#_ftnref1)From Cunningham’s eye-copy. The transcript on p. 128 has *Saganam* and Aga *Rajna.* The true readings are apparently *Sugānaṁ raje* and *Āgaraju.*  
[^(\[2\])](parta14.html#_ftnref2)For the names see notes in A 1.  
[^(\[3\])](parta14.html#_ftnref3)Lüders’ treatment of this inscription is missing.  
[^(\[4\])](parta14.html#_ftnref4)*kamārasa* is obviously a scribe’s mistake for kumārasa.  
[^(\[5\])](parta14.html#_ftnref5)This derivation is not quite certain, but more probable than that of Barua and Sinha who suggest Vṛiddhapāla. For *vādha=vṛiddha* they refer to *‘vādharāja’* in the Hathigumphā inscription *(List* No. 1345), but there *vadharājan* appears. The name Vādhapāla (=Vyādhapāla) has been classified above (I, 4, a, 5) as Śaivite.
