**PART B**

TRANSLATION:  
The walk Tikoṭika (triangular).

In the left corner of the medallion is a *chaṅkama* of triangular form decorated with floral designs. The recess in the middle is filled by a three-headed serpent. Near the *chaṅkama* are two trees and a water-trough. In the lower left quarter are two lions and the whole of the right half is occupied by a herd of seven elephants in the attitude of feeding, drinking and throwing their trunks backwards. Cunningham took the sculpture as a representation of the Nāgaloka. It is unnecessary to discuss this assumption which is based on perfectly impossible explanations of *tikoṭiko*[^(\[1\])](partb111.html#_f%0Atn1) and *chakama.* Barua-Sinha’s attempt to interpret the bas-relief by a Jātaka invented for the occasion has been refuted already by Vogel, *JRAS.* 1927, p. 594 ff. Barua’s later suggestion that the medallion represents the lake near Benares in which the Buddha used to wash his clothes is incompatible with the clear meaning of the label. I quite agree with him that, like the *daḍanikama* walk, the triangular walk also is some monument associated with some legend which is not known to us.

[^(\[1\])](partb111.html#_ftnref1)*Tikoṭiko* naturally cannot have anything to do with *Trikūṭa.* Its meaning can only be ‘triangular’. Hultzsch, IA., l.c., note 47: *“Tisraḥ koṭayo yasya saḥ,* ‘triangular;”. By chance koṭi just in connection with *chaṅkamana* occurs in J. III, 85, 8; IV, 329, 5.
