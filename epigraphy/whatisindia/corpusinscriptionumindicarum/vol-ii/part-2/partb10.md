**PART B**

with Ajakālaka. Barua-Sinha have identified Ajakālaka with the Yaksha Ajakalāpaka who in *Ud.* I, 7 is said to have had his dwelling at the Ajakalāpaka chaitya in Pāvā. In a dark rainy night he tried to frighten the Buddha by uttering horrid cries, but only with the effect that the Buddha pronounced an *udāna.* Although it would be quite appropriate that a Yaksha of the demoniac class should be associated with Kubera, it is difficult to account for the difference of the final member of the names. Hultzsch had carried back Ajakālaka to Sk. *Ādyakālaka,* an explanation not very satisfactory in itself, and not made more reliable by the remarks made by Barua and Sinha in its support, for I, at least, take it as most improbable that a local Yaksha should be “a terrible embodiment of the ruthless unborn Time, destroying living beings, whose essence is immortality”. Besides the form Ajakalāpaka which according to Barua and Sinha is just a side form of Ajakālaka cannot be brought into agreement with this explanation. The Commentary to the *Ud.* offers two explanations: Ajakalāpaka is either ‘some one making a bundle of goats’ because the Yaksha accepts gifts only together with a tied up group of goats; or Ajakalāpaka ‘some one who makes men bleat like goats’, because people, when offering gifts shout like goats in order to satisfy him *(so kira yakkho aje kalāpetvā bandhanena ajakoṭṭhāsena saddhiṃ baliṃ paṭicchati no aññathā tasmā Ajakalāpako ti paññāyittha \| keci pana ajake viya satte lāpetīti Ajakalāpako ti \| tasa kira sattā baliṃ upanetvā yadā ajasaddaṃ katvā baliṃ upaharantī tadā so tussati \| tasmā Ajakalāpaka ti vuccatīti \| ).* Although I am of the opinion that the first part of the name is a word for goat, I think the explanations of the commentary are unacceptable. If both names have to be connected, which I think probable, it is nearest to take *kālaka* and *kalāpaka* as noun formations to the causative of a roof *kal* that could as well form *kālayati* and *kalāpayati.* Perhaps this *kālayati* or *kalāpayati* had the same meaning as Sk. *kālayati* ‘to make some one run before oneself’, ‘to persecute’, ‘to scare away’, ‘drive offâ€?.

The Yaksha Viruḍaka *(Virūḍhaka).*

The pillar P 1 shows three male figures, each on one side. Our inscription refers to the middle figure, the right and left arm of which is united with arm of the adjoining figure

^(\[1\])The explanation given above is the one offered by Lüders, *Bhārh.,* p. 14f.─Earlier in his manuscript he had suggested the following derivation: “May we assume that Ajakālaka is a corruption of Ajagālaka and that Ajakalāpaka is a corruption of Ajagalāpaka or Ajagalāvaka, *gōlaka* and *galāpaka* being derived from the causative of *gal* ‘to devour’, which may be *gāleti or galāpeti?* That Ajakalāpaka contains *aja,* the word for goat, appears from the commentary. However, it cannot be denied that *ajagara* ‘devourer of goats’, which in Pāli sometimes, e.g. *J.* 427, 2, is corrupted into *ajakara,* would seem to be a more suitable name than ‘causing goats to be devoured’, and so my suggestion must be taken for what it is worth”. For an explanation as *ajaka-lāpaka* cf. M. A. Mehendale, S. K. Belvalkar Felicitation Volume, p. 13.
