**PART A**

***A 41 (858)[^(\[1\])](parta29.html#_f%0Atn1) ; PLATE VII***

EDITED by Cunningham, *StBh.* (1879), p. 141, No. 43, and Pl. LVI ; Hultzsch, ɀDMG., Vol. XL (1886). p. 74, No. 136, and Pl., and IA., Vol. XXI (1892), P. 237, No. 136; Barua- Sinha, *BI.* (1926), p. 26, No. 93.

**TEXT:  
bhadata-Samikasa Therāk\[ū\]ṭiyasa[^(\[2\])](parta29.html#_f%0Atn2) dānaṁ**

TRANSLATION:  
Gift of the reverend Samika (Svāmika),[^(\[3\])](parta29.html#_f%0Atn3) the inhabitant of Therākūṭa *(Sthavirākūṭa).*

 Hultzsch took Samika and Therākūṭa as names of two donors, and Lüders in his *List* was the first to explain the word Therākūṭiya as ‘inhabitant of Therākūṭa’. Lüders, how-ever, followed Hultzsch at that time, when taking Samika as the equivalent of Sk. *Śyānaka,* apparently regarding *Samika* as an error for *Samaka* recurring in A 66 in *bhadata-Samaka.* In A 6 where Samika is the name of a lay-donor Lüders explains it by *Svāmika* (as already *List* No. 244), and in view of the fact that there is no marked difference in naming laymen and Buddhist clergymen there is no reason why *Svāmika* should not be the name of a *bhadanta.* The explanation of *Samika by Śamika* (Barua-Sinha) needs no discussion.

**TRANSLATION:**

The gift of the nun Badhikā *(Baddhikā),*[^(\[4\])](parta29.html#_f%0Atn4) the daughter of Mahamukhi *(Mahāmukhin),*[^(\[5\])](parta29.html#_f%0Atn5) the Dabhinikā (inhabitant of *Darbhiṇa* *?*).

Hultzsch’s suggestion accepted by Barua-Sinha that *Badhikaya* might be a clerical mistake for *Bodhikaya* is wrong. *Badhikā* is the female name corresponding to Badhaka occuring as the name of two different monks in the Sāñchī inscriptions, List Nos. 484 and 633. The Sanskrit equivalent of *Mahamukhisa* is hardly *Mahāmukhyasya* as assumed by Barua- Sinha. Female adjectives are frequently formed from names of places with the suffix*ikā.* The name of the place must therefore be *Dabhina,* in Sanskrit perhaps *Darbhiṇa,* but not *Darbha*[^(\[6\])](parta29.html#_f%0Atn6) as stated by Barua-Sinha. A parallel place-name is Dharakina in the Sāñchī inscription, *List* No. 259.

[^(\[1\])](parta29.html#_ftnref1) LÃ¼ders’ treatment of this inscription is missing.  
[^(\[2\])](parta29.html#_ftnref2) The ū in the akshara kū is not quite distinct ; it could also be read u.  
[^(\[3\])](parta29.html#_ftnref3) See classification I, 4, a 5 (Śaivite names).  
[^(\[4\])](parta29.html#_ftnref4) See classification II, 2, b (names derived from mental disposition and temperament). We take Baddhikā characterising a female ‘bound to’ worldly desires.  
[^(\[5\])](parta29.html#_ftnref5) See classification II, 1, a (names derived from parts of the body).  
[^(\[6\])](parta29.html#_ftnref6) According to Barua-Sinha, in the Brahmāṇḍa-and a few other Purāṇas *Darva or Darbha* is mentioned as a country on the hills.
