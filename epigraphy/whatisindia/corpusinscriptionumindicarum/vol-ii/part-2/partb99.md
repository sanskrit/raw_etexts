**PART B**

mistake for *chetiyaṁ.* The explanation of *chātiyaṁ* as loc. sg. of P. *chāṭi* ‘ pot, vessel ’ given by Barua and Sinha is linguistically impossible, apart from the fact that in the relief no vessel of any kind is represented. Likewise I cannot agree with Barua-Sinha’s identification of the relief with the Mātiposakaj. (455). In the Jātaka it is narrated that the Bodhisattva was once reborn as an elephant. He was captured to serve the king of Kāsī as state elephant, but was released by the same king when the latter heard that the elephant had to nourish his blind mother left behind in the forest. When the Bodhisattva had returned to his mother he sprinkled her with water from a lotus pond. Now we find in the relief indeed two elephants and also a brook which could perhaps take the place of the lotus pond; but it is not depicted how the one elephant besprinkles the other. This besprinkling is an essential part of the story. It is not only to be seen from the fact that it is expressly mentioned in the Gāthās; it has also led to a further development of the legend. The Mvu. where the Jātaka occurs (Vol. III, p. 130 ff.) and the Fo-pȇn-hing-tsi-king (Beal, Rom. Leg., p. 366 ff.) narrate that the elephant’s mother regained her eye-sight by the besprinkling, in the same way as the blind Mahāprajāpati regained the power to see when the water at the *mahāprātihārya* in Kapilavastu streamed down on her. Besides it is expressly stated in G. 4 ff. of the Jātaka that the noble elephant lived with his mother on the mountain Chaṇḍoraṇa. In the prose narration is added that, after the death of his mother, he went into the hermitage Karaṇḍaka. There the king erected a stone image of the elephant, and men from all India used to assemble at the spot every year to celebrate the festival of the elephant. In the *Mvu.* the mountain on which the elephant and his mother stayed is called Chaṇḍagiri, a hill in front of the Himavat. These particulars are not in conformity with the inscription which says that the Chaitya was on the *Aboda.*

Hoernle[^(\[1\])](partb99.html#_f%0Atn1) took *Aboda* as equivalent of Sk. Arbuda, the old name of the famous mountain Ābū, but it is not probable that the *u* in Arbuda should have become o. On the other hand the landscape represented shows decisively that Aboda is the name of a mountain. This is confirmed by the form of the name. No less than six times in the Bhārhut inscriptions the name Naḍoda is found, twice with the addition *pavata,* and a mountain Ṛikshoda is mentioned as the birth place of brahmins in the Kāśikā on *Pāṇ, 4, 3, 91: Ṛikshodaḥ parvato ’ bhijana eshāṁ brāhmaṇānām Ārkshodā brāhmaṇāḥ.* Whatever the second part[^(\[2\])](partb99.html#_f%0Atn2) of the name may be, its composition with *naḍa* ‘read’ and *ṛiksha* ‘ bear ’ makes it almost certain that Aboda contains the word *āmra* ‘ mango ’. *Abode* accordingly is written in the normal fashion for aṁbode. The Chaitya on the Amboda, the mango-mountain, was probably a sanctuary of local importance. In the relief its veneration by elephants carrying offerings is represented; cf. similar reliefs on Cunningham’s Pl. XXX 2 (B 70-72) and XLVI 6.

[^(\[2\])](partb99.html#_ftnref2)I am of the opinion that these names of mountains, like *Himavat* etc., are formed with the suffix-vat. Ṛikshavat, Naḍavat, Āmravat were transferred in Prakrit to the a-flexion and with the softening of t to d and wish contraction of ava to o became *Achchhoda, Naḍoda* and *Aṁboda.* Ṛikshoda is a result of incomplete Sanskritisation. The correct Sanskrit form Ṛikshavat is attested in the Epics and in the works of Kālidāsa.
