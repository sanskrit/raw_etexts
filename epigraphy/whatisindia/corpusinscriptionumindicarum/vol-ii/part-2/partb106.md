**PART B**

TRANSLATION :  
The dhenachhaka (?) at the foot of (Mount) Naḍoda.

 Barua-Sinha boldly identify *dhenachhako* with *dhonasākho* which in J. 353, 4 seems to be a name of the banyan tree. The meaning of *dhonasākha* is obscure. Instead of *dhona*- the Ceylonese manuscripts read also *yona- and dona-,* the Burmese manuscripts constantly *vena-,* and I should consider it not quite improbable that the original reading was *poṇasākho = Sk. pravaṇaśākhaḥ,* ‘ with sloping branches ’. But even granting that *dhena-* of the inscription is a misreading for *dhona-,* or that *dhona-* of the Pāli text is a corruption of *dhena-,* it seems to me impossbile that *–chhako* should be the equivalent of P. *–sākho, Sk. –śākhaḥ.* As we know from the inscriptions Nos. B 73 and B 74 several things producing miracles such as a jambū tree granting food and a tattered cloth that could be milked, existed on Mount Naḍoda, and one might be tempted to take *dhenachhako* as a misreading for *dhenuchhako,* which may represent *dhenūtsakaḥ,* the ‘ cow-well ’, i.e. a well which yielded milk like a cow; but in the absence of the sculpture all conjectures are practically futile.
