**PART A**

**UNCLASSIFIED FRAGMENTARY DONATIVE INSCRIPTIONS**

TEXT:  
…sā Kusu…[^(\[1\])](parta65.html#_f%0Atn1)

TRANSLATION:  
(The gift of ?) Kusu(ma ?)…. from (Vedi)sa (?)[^(\[2\])](parta65.html#_f%0Atn2).

***A 136 (757); PLATE XV***

FRANGMENTARY inscription on a terminus pillar, now in the Indian Museum, Calcutta. Edited by Cunningham, *StBh.* (1879), p. 135, No. 46, and Pl. LIV; Barua-Sinha, BI. (1926), p. 11, No. 19; Barua, *Barh.,* Vol. II (1934), p. 63 f., and Pl. (?)[^(\[3\])](parta65.html#_f%0Atn3).

TEXT:  
Yasikaâ€¦.

Yasika[^(\[4\])](parta65.html#_f%0Atn4) may be the name of the Yaksha figured on the pillar. It could also be that of the donor, although the word is not found elsewhere as a personal name and it is not even certain that it was the beginning of the inscription.

[^(\[1\])](parta65.html#_ftnref1)From the eye-copy of Cunningham. The inscription is broken off on both sides.  
[^(\[2\])](parta65.html#_ftnref2)The translation is no more than a conjecture.  
[^(\[3\])](parta65.html#_ftnref3)I am unable to state where the stone bearing the inscription is figured. In Barua’s text it is called: Scene 64”. On his Plate LIX we are informed that No. 64” is No. 65 of the Plate. But the statue does not agree with the description. The Yaksha does not stand with joined hands on a bearded and human-faced quadruped, but with the right hand raised on a sea-monster.  
[^(\[4\])](parta65.html#_ftnref4)Under the assumption that the name is to be derived from *yaśas,* ‘fame’ it has been classified under II, 3, a (names derived from wealth, fame, and birth).
