**PART B**

*Asaḍā is Sk. Ashāḍhā,* with the usual inaccurate spelling of *ḍ* instead of *ḍh,* and an abbreviation of some name such as *Asāḷhamittā.* The name belongs to the large class of personal names the first part of which is formed by the name of an asterism; why it should be taken to mean ‘the buxom’, as suggested by Barua-Sinha, I am unable to see.

 The sculpture to which the label belongs is a fragment. It shows on the left a tree among wells, on the right a recess with a short-haired man of whom only half of the head and upper part of the body is preserved. Cunningham’s identification of the sculpture with the conversion of Uruvelā Kassapa and his two brothers is very improbable. Barua has tried to complete the fragment by the photograph of a lost fragment which bears the figure of an elephant[^(\[1\])](partb94.html#_f%0Atn1), and in his search for a suitable subject of the sculpture he has hit on the Indasamāngottajātaka (No. 161) or the Mittāmittajātaka (No. 197) both of which contain the story of a tāpasa who was killed by his pet elephant. But this identification cannot be accepted as a glance at the figure 98a on plate LXXV in Barua’s book will be sufficient to show that the two fragments do not go together.

 The story represented in the sculpture is not known. The preserved portion of the relief is divided into three compartments. In the upper compartment there is a large building surrounded by a railing. In the windows and the arched recesses behind the balcony of the upper storey the faces of a number of women are visible. From the gateway in the left

[^(\[1\])](partb94.html#_ftnref1)According to Barua there are visible at the feet of the elephant some burning fire altars. I am not able to recognize anything of it in the photographic reproduction.
