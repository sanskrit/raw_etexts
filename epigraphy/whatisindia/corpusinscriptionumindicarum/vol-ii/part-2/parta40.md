**PART A**

Three sides of the pillar are decked with sculptures. Each face has three reliefs marked at the bottom by a railing and flanked, the uppermost by a palm-tree and only lower ones by octagonal pillars with bell-shaped capitals. As this inscription is the only donative inscription on the pillar, it probably refers to the gift of the whole pillar, although the object of the donation is not stated.

[^(\[1\])](parta40.html#_ftnref1)From Cunningham’s eye-copy which agrees with his transcript.  
[^(\[2\])](parta40.html#_ftnref2)See classification I, 4, a, 6 (Vaishnavite names).  
[^(\[3\])](parta40.html#_ftnref3)Monks are also called *bhadanta or aya* when (a) their native place is mentioned and (b) specific church titles are given. For (a) see No. A 38 *(bhadaṁta aya),* A 41 *(bhadaṁta),* A 8 (aya) ; for (b) see A 39, A 58, A 59, A 61 *(bhadaṁta),* A 51, A 56, A 59, A 62 *(aya).*  
[^(\[4\])](parta40.html#_ftnref4)Hultzsch and Barua-sinha *donaṁ.* The horizontal stroke to the left of *dā* which gives the akshara the appearance of *do* is much thinner than the d-stroke and probably accidental.
