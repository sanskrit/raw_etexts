**ADDITONS AND CORRECTIONS  
1962**

**(A) ADDITIONS**

1. Since the writing of our “Postscript 1953” (p. VI), mentioning the removal of fiftyfour pieces of the railing of the Stūpa of Bhārhut to the Allahabad Municipal Museum, some more information regarding the whereabouts of the Bhārhut sculpture and inscriptions has come to our notice.

 Two reliefs, one of them with the inscription No. A 112 which, according to Cunningham **((StBh.,** Pl. LVI, 65) came “from Uchahara”, and another with a representation of the Bodhi Tree **(StBh.,** Pl. XXXI, 3), are now in the Freer Gallery, U.S.A., sec A. K. Coomaraswamy, **The Two Reliefs from Bharhut in the Freer Gallery,** Journal of the Indian Society of Oriental Art, Vol. VI (1938), pp. 149-162. The sculptures are also reproduced in Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, **La Sculpture de Bharhut,** traduction de Jean Buhot, Paris 1956, Plate XXV. This book does not contribute much regarding the inscriptions; however, it presents Bhārhut sculptures in fifty-one plates in a quality superior to ours. As the book is easily available, it will be useful to state where our inscriptions are to be found in the illustrations of the book and vice versa :
