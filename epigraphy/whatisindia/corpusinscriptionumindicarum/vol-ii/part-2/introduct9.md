**INTRODUCTION**

One wonders whether these instances suggest a slightly appreciable tendency to pronounce the first syllable short, as the following instances perhaps show a tendency to pronounce the second syllable short : *Āgaraju*[^(\[1\])](introduct9.html#_ftn1) A 1, *Agaraju* A *2, Biḍala* B 42, *Sujata* B 50, *avayesi* B 51, *Asaḍā* B 64. In the instances *vijadhara*─ B 61, *Muhamukhi─* A 42, and *Mahakoka* B 12 the change has occurred in compound.

> \(V\) The change of *ā*\>i in *Venuvagimiyā (Sk. Veṇukagrāma*─) is not
> certain, as Lüders, is inclined to read *Venuvagāmiyā.*  
> § 7. Treatment of the Sk. vowel *i:* The vowel is fairly well
> preserved. The changes, that occur are rather sporadic and have no
> general application.  
> (I) Change *i*\>*ī* before a cluster. The only illustrations are :
> *Bībikanadikaṭa* A 22 (if its derivation from *Bimbikānadīkaṭa* is
> correct). *Mahendrasena─\>\*Mahiddasena─* \>Mahīdasena─ A 13. But we
> find that the short vowel is preserved in such cases as *Idadevā* A
> 19, A 45.  
> (II) Change *i*\>*e* before a cluster, observed only in *Vesabhu─
> (Viśvabhū─)* B 14 and *Anādhapeḍika─(-piṇḍika-)* B 22. The same
> change, but not before a cluster, is perhaps to be seen in
> *Kasabeyekā─ (Kauśāmbeyikā─)* A 52 (but Lüders is inclined to read
> *kosabeyikaya),* and in *śrī─\>seri─* A 100 (see, however, f.n. 3 to A
> 100, p.52).  
> (III) Writing of *i* as *a*, obviously due to the negligence on the
> part of the scribe to attach *i* vowel mark, is seen in *chetaya* (for
> *chetiya*\<*chaitya*) B 68, *Samaka─ (svāmi─)* A 66, *Moragirami
> (giri─)* A 26, and *timigala* B 62 (but Lüders pro- poses to read
> *timiṁgila)*.  
> (IV) Change *u* due to assimilation in *u\[su\] (kāro) (ishu)*-B 56,
> and *Susupālo (Śiśupāla─)* B 72.  

 Â§ 8. Treatment of the long vowel *i:* This vowel is mostly shortened before the gen. sg. term., in the compound formation, in suffixes and occasionally before a consonant

[^(\[1\])](introduct9.html#_ftnref1)Perhaps an instance of metatheses. But we may also read *Agaraju;* see § 5 (I), p. XV.
