> > > > 2 sa dānaṁ thabho

TRANSLATION:

The pillar (is) the gift of the reverend Budharakhita *(Buddharakshita)*[^(\[1\])](parta38.html#_f%0Atn1) who has abandoned attachment.

 The meaning of *saṭupādāna* has not yet been ascertained. It does not seem to be a proper name, but rather denotes some clerical dignitary. Hultzsch hesitatingly traced it back to Sk. *śāstropādāna* and translated it ‘who is versed in sciences’, but although *saṭa* may stand for *saṭṭha,* it is very improbable that the *stra* of *śastra* should develop into lingual *ṭha.* Nor do I understand how *upādāna* could possibly have been used as an adjective. Barua-Sinha take *saṭupadāna* as ‘a monumental Prakrit counterpart of the Pāli *Satipaṭṭhāna* or *Satipaṭṭhānika* and the Sanskrit *Smṛaityupasthāna* or *Smṛaityupasthānika’* (sic). I consider it unnecessary to discuss this explanation. In my opinion *saṭupadāna* is an imperfect spelling for *saṭṭupādāna =Sk. sṛishṭopādāna,* ‘who has abandoned attachment’, With *saṭṭa* for *saṭṭha* we may compare participle such as *maṭṭa=Sk. mṛishṭa (D. II, 133), saṁtatta =Sk* *saṁtrasta* (f. 322, 2), and with the whole term *samavasaṭṭhesana*[^(\[2\])](parta38.html#_f%0Atn2), ‘one who has completely abandoned longing’ (D. III, 269; A. II, 41), and *anupādāna* ‘free from attachment’ or ‘clinging to existence’, frequently used of an Arhat.
