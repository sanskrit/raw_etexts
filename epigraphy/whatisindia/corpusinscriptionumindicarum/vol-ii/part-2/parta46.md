[^(\[1\])](parta46.html#_ftnref1)For donations of men whose native places have been mentioned see No. A 6, A 7, A 13, A23, A 25, A 26, A 30, A 31, A 36, A 40, A 47, A 50. A few inscriptions referring to men give the profersion as well as the native place, cf. No. A 17, A 22; in A 21 the donor is characterized as *gahapati.* A 55 mentions the profession of the male donor, but not the native place.  
[^(\[2\])](parta46.html#_ftnref2)See classification II, 4, a (names derived from plants).  
[^(\[3\])](parta46.html#_ftnref3)Lüders’ treatment of this inscription is missing.  
[^(\[4\])](parta46.html#_ftnref4)See classification II, 2, a (names derived from mental disposition and temperament). Instead of *a-vishaṇṇa* “not sorrowful” the name could also be interpreted as *a-vishāṇa* “not having horns”.  
[^(\[5\])](parta46.html#_ftnref5)*avisanasa* has been read by all previous editors, but our estampage does not bring out any traced of *a* in the beginning, whereas Cunningham’s eye-copy shows the *a* clearly.
