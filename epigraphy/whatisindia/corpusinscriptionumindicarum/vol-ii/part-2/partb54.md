as started in the text. In the right corner another elephant with large tusks is kneeling, the female-mahout sitting far back near the tail. This is the elephant of Jīvaka, who has dismounted and it talking to the king as indicated by his raised right hand. Two trees laden with mangoes show that the scene is Jīvaka’s Mango Grove. The seat of the Buddha is in the upper right corner below a parasol with pendants hanging down from it. The presence of the Buddha is symbolized by his foot-prints on the foot-rest. The king is kneeling before the seat, while Jīvaka and four women are standing behind him with their hands reverentially folded. A burning swing-lamp indicates that the visit takes place at night.
