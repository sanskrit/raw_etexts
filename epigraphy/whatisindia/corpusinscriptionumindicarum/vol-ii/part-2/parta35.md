**PART A**

donor of a pillar, mentioned in the inscription A 54. For *bhātu cf. matu, dhitu* p. XXVII (§33). In A 50 the Gen. sg. of *naptṛ is natuno.* It is, however, impossible to read the traces of the *akshara* following *bhātu* as *no.* The *akshara* may have been *pa* or *ha* as Dr. Sircar has suggested, and represent the initial consonant of the name of the donor.

***A 54b; PLATE XXVII***

ON a rail-bar, now in the Allahabad Municipal Museum (Ac/2972). Edited by Kala, Bh V. (1951), p. 33; Sircar, EI., XXXXIII (1959/60), p. 58.

**TEXT:**  
\[Na\]garakhitasa cha mātu cha Kamuchukaye dānaṁ.

**TRANSLATION:**

Gift of Nagarakhita *(Nāgarakshita)* as well as of (his) mother[^(\[1\])](parta35.html#_f%0Atn1), the Kamuchukā (inhabitant of *Kamuchu ?*)[^(\[2\])](parta35.html#_f%0Atn2).

Similarly it is recorded in No. A 96b that the mother of Gośāla shared with her son in the expenses of a rail-bar.

[^(\[1\])](parta35.html#_ftnref1)Cf. A 18, A 28, A 120.  
[^(\[2\])](parta35.html#_ftnref2)Dr. Kala regards *Kamuchukā* as the name of the mother, whereas Dr. Sircar reads the second part of the inscription: *cha mātu Chakamuchukaye dānaṁ* “and (his) mother Chakramochikā”. He notes: “The word cha possibly suggests that the present epigraph was the second of a set of two inscriptions, the first recording a gift of Ngarakshita, while the inscription under study records only the gift of his mother.â€?
