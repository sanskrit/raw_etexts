**PART B**

**9. B 79-82 FRAGMENTARY INSCRIPTIONS REFERRING TO THE JĀTAKAS  
OR RELIGIOUS LEGENDS**

***B 79 (884)[^(\[1\])](partb112.html#_f%0Atn1); PLATE XXIII***

RAIL inscription, now in the Indian Museum, Calcutta. First edited by Hultzsch, *ɀDMG.* Vol. XL (1886), p. 75, No. 153, and Pl.; Hultzsch, *IA.* Vol. XXI (1892), p. 239, No. 153; Barua-Sinha, *BI.* (1926), p. 33, No. 117.

TEXT:  
.. .. .. \[da\] Himavate i .. .. .. .. ..

TRANSLATION:  
.. ..on the Himavata *(Himavat)* .. ..

 According to Barua-Sinha it is doubtful whether this inscription is ‘a votive or a Jātaka label’. The only readable word *Himavate* reminds one of the stories connected with mountain Naḍoda treated under B 73 ff. Some remarkable event which took place on the Himālaya may have been depicted on the lost relief to which this inscription originally belonged.

***B 80 (897)[^(\[2\])](partb112.html#_f%0Atn2); PLATE XXIII***

FIRST edited by Cunningham, *StBh.* (1897), p. 143, No. 14, and Pl. LVI; Barua-Sinha, *BI.* (1926), p. 80 f., No. 191; Barua, *Barh.* Vol. II (1934), p. 89 f.; Lüders, *Bhārh.* (1941) p. 5 f.

TEXT:  
.. .. ..\[n\]iyajataka

TRANSLATION:  
The Jātaka of .. .. ..niya.

 The inscription records the name of some Jātaka. Barua restores the label to Bhojā-jānīya-Jātakaṁ, the title of the J. 23 in the Pāli collection. After having found out that the Bhojānīyajātaka relates the tale of a thorough-bred Sindh horse, he connects the label with a small fragment of the coping-stone (Cunningham, *StBh.* Pl. XLV, 1; Barua, Barh. Vol. III (1937), Pl. LXXI, 90) where at the left corner the head and the forefoot of a horse are visible, and gives the Bhojājānīyajātaka as identified in his list of identified reliefs. But, according to Lüders, the restoration of the inscription as proposed by Barua is quite arbitrary. The n in niya is fragmentary and –iya at the end of title of the Jātakas in the Bhārhut labels is common. It is found in about one-third of the total number of cases[^(\[3\])](partb112.html#_f%0Atn3). So this identification is nothing more than an unfounded supposition.

[^(\[1\])](partb112.html#_ftnref1)The treatment of Lüders of this inscription has not been recovered.  
[^(\[2\])](partb112.html#_ftnref2)The treatment of Lüders of this inscription has been lost. The reading is according to the eye-copy of Cunningham.  
[^(\[3\])](partb112.html#_ftnref3)E.g. Maghādeviya, Bhisaharaniya, Chhadaṁtiya, Isisiṁgiya, Viturapunakiya, Mugaphakiya, Yavamajhakiya.
