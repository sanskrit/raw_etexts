**PART A**

female donor is not mentioned, but she is called ‘the mother of so and so’ cf. *Seṭaka-mātu (Śreshṭhaka-mātṛi)* A 18, *Ghāṭila-mātu* A 28, and *Tosālasa māta = Gosālasa matu (Gośālasya mātuḥ)* A 90. In A 54b, a man named *Nagarakhita (Nāgarakshita)* occurs as a donor in the company of his mother.

 A female donor is referred to as ‘ the wife of so and so’ in *Revatimitabhāriyā (Revatīmi- trabhāryā)* A 34, in *Vasukasa bhāriyā* A 46, or ‘the daughter of so and so’ in *Mahamukhisa dhitu (Mahāmukhino duhituḥ)* A 42.

 The professions of lay-donors are mentioned only in two cases. One of the donors (A 22) is styled as ‘horseman’ *(asavārika = aśvavārika),* and the other (A 55) as ‘sculptor’ *(rupakāraka=rūpakāraka)*. In A 21, the donor is characterized as ‘householder’ *(gahapati- gṛihapati).*[^(\[1\])](parta3.html#_f%0Atn1)

**Personal Names**

 As the following classification points out, there is a great variety in the names given to persons. A large number of these names is religious (theophoric).[^(\[5\])](parta3.html#_f%0Atn5) Apparently we are in a period when the worship of old vedic deities still existed and when the rule of some Gṛihyasūtras recommending to name a person after some nakshatra was in vogue. But the cult of minor deities and spirits like Yakshas, Bhūtas and Nāgas and of saints seems to have

[^(\[1\])](parta3.html#_ftnref1) In Sāñchī inscriptions there is a great variety of professional epithets like *seṭhi* (a banker), *vanija* (a merchant), *āvesani* (a foreman of artisans), *rājalipikara* (a royal scribe), *rajuka* (a high District officer), *lekhaka* (a writer), *vaḍhaki* (a mason), *pāvārika* (a cloak-seller), *sotika* (a weaver), and *kamika* (an artisan). The epithets ‘horseman’ (*asavārika,* Bhārh. A 22) and ‘householder’ (*gahapati,* Bhārh. A 21) occur as well (Rhys Davids SBE XI, p. 257, note, sees in *gahapati* a ‘village landholder’).  
[^(\[2\])](parta3.html#_ftnref2) In Sāñchī we get some more ecclesiastical titles like *thera* (Senior), *dhamakathika* (preacher of the law), *vināyaka* ( guide, instructor) and *sapurisa* (a holy man). On the general importance of some of the church titles see below p. 48 and notes.  
[^(\[3\])](parta3.html#_ftnref3) The donor is not specially said to be a monk. But the office he holds is known from the pāli texts to be that of a clergyman.  
[^(\[4\])](parta3.html#_ftnref4)The corresponding designation for monks : *bhikhu or bhichhu (bhikshu)* is not to be found, as mentioned above p. 1, note 11.
