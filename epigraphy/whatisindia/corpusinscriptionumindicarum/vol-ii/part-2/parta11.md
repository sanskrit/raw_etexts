**TRANSLATION :**

 During the reign of the Sugas *(Śuṅgas)*[^(\[5\])](parta11.html#_f%0Atn5) the gateway was caused to be made and the stone-work (i.e. carving) presented by Dhanabhūti,[^(\[6\])](parta11.html#_f%0Atn6) the son of a Vāchhī *(Vātsī),*[^(\[7\])](parta11.html#_f%0Atn7) son of Āgaraju *(Aṅgāradyut),*[^(\[8\])](parta11.html#_f%0Atn8) the son of a Gotī *(Gauptī)*[^(\[9\])](parta11.html#_f%0Atn9) and grandson of king Visadeva *(Viśvadeva),*[^(\[9\])](parta11.html#_f%0Atn9) the son of Gāgī *(Gārgi).*[^(\[7\])](parta11.html#_f%0Atn7)

 That the *Śuṅgas* are meant by the *Sugas* was first recognised by Bühler. *Raje* was translated by Rajendralala Mitra ‘in the kingdom’, by Barua-Sinha ‘within the dominion’, [^(\[10\])](parta11.html#_f%0Atn10) but the term *rājyasaṁvatsare* in No. 22 and 33, *rajyasaṁ* in No. 51 of my List is in favour of the meaning ‘during the reign’ assigned to the word by Hultzsch. *Silākaṁmaṁto* was first correctly explained by Rajendralala Mitra; it refers no doubt to the sculptures on the gateway. Bühler was the first to derive *upaṁno* from Sk. *utpannaḥ,* but his translation was wrong. Hultzsch rendered *‘silākaṁmaṁto cha upaṁno*’ at first ‘and the masonry was finished’ and later on â€œand the stone-work aroseâ€™.

 Barua-Sinha take upaṁno in the sense of the causative and translate â€˜and the workmanship

[^(\[1\])](parta11.html#_ftnref1) Another donation by a member of the royal family is probably to be found in the fragmentary donative inscription No. A 130.  
[^(\[2\])](parta11.html#_ftnref2) This word has been read by all editors as *pauteṇa.* But as the diphthong au never occurs in the Bhārhut inscriptions and as it is linguistically untenable we suggest to read *poteṇa,* the more as the middle horizontal mark to the left, which is supposed to give the *mātrā* for *au,* is very slight and hence it is very likely that it is just an accidental prolongation of the middle horizontal mark to the right. On somewhat similar ground Lüders himself reads *dānaṁ* instead of *donaṃ* in A 64.  
[^(\[3\])](parta11.html#_ftnref3) Read *toraṇaṁ.* The engraver has forgotten to incise the left upper bar of *ṇa.*  
[^(\[4\])](parta11.html#_ftnref4) The last *akshara* looks like *ṇa,* but there can be little doubt that it is to be read *no,* the right portion of the o-sign being attached to the top of the na and not as usually to the middle of the letter.  
[^(\[5\])](parta11.html#_ftnref5) The name appears in the classification given above II, 4 a (names derived from plants). Śuṅga is a name for the Indian fig tree *(=vaṭa)*.  
[^(\[6\])](parta11.html#_ftnref6) See classification II, 3, a (names derived from wealth, fame, and birth).  
[^(\[7\])](parta11.html#_ftnref7) Regarding gotra-names cf. p.2.  
[^(\[8\])](parta11.html#_ftnref8) See classification 1, 2, B, a (names derived from planets). Hultzsch, IA., Vol. XXI (1892), p. 227, note 11: “As suggested by Dr. Bühler, this name has to be explained by *Aṅgāra\[ka\] iva dyotate ity Aṅgāra- dyut,* ‘shining like (the planet) Mars’.”  
[^(\[9\])](parta11.html#_ftnref9) See classification 1, 3, a (names referring to vedic deities).  
[^(\[10\])](parta11.html#_ftnref10) Barua, temporarily having changed his opinion, translates ‘during the reign of the Śuṅgas’ in *Barh.* I, p. 29, but ‘within the dominion of the Śuṅgas’ again *ibid.,* p. 41.
