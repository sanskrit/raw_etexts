**TRANSLATIONS:**

 The gift of Mahīdasena *(Mahendrasena)*[^(\[1\])](parta19.html#_f%0Atn1) from Pāṭaliputa *(Pāṭaliputra).*

**A 14 (719); PLATES III, XXVIII**

ON a pillar of the South-Eastern quadrant, now in the Indian Museum, Calcutta (P18). Edited by Cunningham, StBh. (1879), p. 132, No. 8, and Pl. LIII; Hultzsch, *ɀDMG.,* Vol. XL (1886), p. 63, No. 28, and Pl., IA., Vol. XXI (1892), p. 229, No. 28; Barua-Sinha, Bl. (1926), p. 7, No. 9.

**TEXT:**  
1 Pāṭal\[i\]putā Nāgasenāya Koḍi- 2 yāniyā dānaṁ[^(\[2\])](parta19.html#_f%0Atn2)

**TRANSLATION:**

 The gift of Nāgasenā,[^(\[3\])](parta19.html#_f%0Atn3) the Koḍiyānī (belonging to the *Koḍiya tribe)*, from Pāṭaliputa *(Pāṭaliputra).*

 Hultzsch mentioned as a possibility that Koḍiyānī, which occurs again as the surname of a lady from Pāṭaliputra in No. A 15, might be the equivalent of Kauṇḍināyanī, and Barua-Sinha have accepted this explanation which in my opinion is phonetically untenable. Hultzsch himself preferred to take Koḍiyānī as the feminine derivation of Koḍiya formed like *aryāṇī* from *arya, kshatriyāṇī,* from *kshatriya,* etc.

There can be little doubt that this is the right view, and that Koḍiyāṇī has the same meaning as Koḷiyadhītā, the epithet of the lay-sister Suppavāsā in A. I, 26. *Koḍiya* occurs as a surname of the *thera* Suṭṭhiya, the founder of the *Koḍiya gaṇa,* in the Sthavirāvalī of the Kalpasūtra of the Jains 4; 10: *therā Suṭṭhiya-Suppaḍibuddhā Koḍiya-Kākaṁdagā* *Vagghāvaccasagottā.*[^(\[4\])](parta19.html#_f%0Atn4) *Koḍiya* becomes *Koḷiya* in Pāli and *Koliya* in the later language. The Koḷiyas or Koliyas are frequently mentioned in Buddhist literature as a tribe that was intimately related to the Sākiyas, although there were quarrels between them about the water of the Rohiṇī river which divided their territories; see *f.* V, 412, 14 ff.; *DhA.* transl. III, 70; *SnA.* 352, 7 ff.; *Mvu.* I, 348, 8 ff.; II, 76, 7; III, 93, 20. That the surname of the Jaina *thera* is nothing else but the name of that tribe is proved by the second designation as Vagghāvacca, which agrees with the statement that the Koḷiyas were known also by the name of Vyāghrapadyas *(Mvu.* I, 355, 13 *kālena rishiṇā jātā tti koliyā tti samājñā vyāghrapathe vyāghrapadyā samājñā cha)* and their town as Koḷanagara or Vyagghapajja (SnA. 356, 17 f.). The legends about the origin of these names are, of course, later inventions[^(\[5\])](parta19.html#_f%0Atn5). I am therefore convinced that Koḍiyānī is a surname of the same meaning as Koḍiya in the Jaina text. The exact counterpart of Koḍiyānī is Śākiyānī, ‘belonging to the Śākya tribe’, used of the mother of the Buddha in *Mvu.* II, 12, 15. Cf. A 15, B 72 and Koḍāya in A 116.
