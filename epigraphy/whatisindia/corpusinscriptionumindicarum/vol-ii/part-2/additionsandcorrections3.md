**ADDITONS AND CORRECTIONS  
1962**

A 26 (806); Plate XLVIII

On a fragmentary railing pillar No. 2 recovered by Prof. K. D. Bajpai. The reading taken from Cunningham’s eye-copy is confirmed by the impression. It may be possible to read **Jātāmitasa,** but the **ā**-stroke of **tā** is rather underdeveloped. To read **Jātamitasa** (as Prof. Bajpai does) is unwarranted and against grammar.

A 36 (877); Plate XLVIII

 Cunningham’s eye-copy of this inscription is described as corning “from Uchahara”. The sculpture is now in the Bhārat Kalā Bhavan, Banaras. The impression now available confirms our reading. Only the anusvāra of **dānaṁ** does not come out clearly in the impression (**dānaṁ** on p. 27 is a misprint for **dānaṁ**).

A 47 (876); Plate XLVIII

 The reading from Cunningham’s eye-copy, described as “from Uchahara” and now in the Bhārat Kalā Bhavan, Banaras, is confirmed by the impression.

A 48 (878); Plate XLVIII

 The remark on A 47 applies also to A 48; we should, however, read **yā** instead of **ya** in **\[Pa\]rakaṭ\[i\]kaya.**

A 104 (879); Plate XLVIII

 The remark on A 47 applies to A 104 too.

A 124 (803)

 The inscription is not a fragmentary one as explained by Lüders; there is also no possibility of combining it with A 43 or with any other inscription as suggested by Barua-Sinha and rejected by Lüders. The inscription is clearly legible as

**Sakaya thabhā dānaṁ**

in the photograph published by Coomaraswamy, l.c. Fig. 47, and can be made out also in the photograph in **StBh.,** Pl. XXI, “Pillar at Batanmāra”, near the left hip of the Yakshi. If this Yakshi is the same as the one discovered by Prof. Bajpai, his reading should not be **Soriya thabo dānaṁ** but **Sakaya** as given above. It is likely that the inscription is somewhat mutilated at present, but the old photographs are quite clear. We have to translate: The pillars (are) the gift of Sakā **(Śakrā).** [^(\[4\])](additionsandcorrections3.html#_ftn1)

B 62 (881); Plate XLVIII

 The reading is : **rimitimiṁgilalakuchhimh\[ā\] Vasu\[g\]ut\[o\] m\[o\]cito Mahādevenaṁ** Cf. note 1 on p. 155.
