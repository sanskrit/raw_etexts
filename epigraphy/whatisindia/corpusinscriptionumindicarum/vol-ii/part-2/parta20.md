[^(\[1\])](parta20.html#_ftnref1) See classification I, 2, A, b (names derived from constellations).  
[^(\[2\])](parta20.html#_ftnref2) From Cunningham’s eye-copy. The transcript has *Purikāya.*  
[^(\[3\])](parta20.html#_ftnref3) *Chula* occurs as the first part of the name of the goddess Chulakokā ‘Little Kokā’ (B 11), cf. also *Chulana* in A 91. *Chula* has been derived from *kshudra* in the translation of our inscription by Lüders in his *List.* Regarding different personal names beginning with Chula see List p. 186. In our classi- fication the name has been grouped as referring to the size of the body, see II, 1, a.  
[^(\[4\])](parta20.html#_ftnref4) The expression *bhatta-uddesaka* occurs in Pāli texts and is translated in PTSD, as ‘(thera) (an elder) who supervises the distribution of food, a superintendent of mealsâ€™.
