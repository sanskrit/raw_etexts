Brahmanical literature; cf. *D. II, 257 f.; III, 202; Mvu.* III, 309.13; *Lalitav.* 218, 9; 390. 19; *Mahām.* P. 230. In all these passages he is called the lord of the Yakshas. The spelling of his name in the inscription with p instead of b (surd instead of sonant) has parallels in such forms as *Erāpata¬-* and *Vitura-.*

TRANSLATION:  
The Yakshī Chadā *(Chandra).*

This female figure is standing under a Nāga tree (Mesua ferrea)[^(\[1\])](partb9.html#_f%0Atn1) on a sheep or ram with the hindpart of a fish. This probably characterizes her as a water-goddess. With her right hand she grasps a bough of the tree over her head, while her left hand and her left. leg are thrown around the trunk of the tree.

***B 3 (795); PLATES XVI, XXIX***

ON the outer face of the same pillar as Nos. A 58, B 1 and B 2, now in the Indian museum, Calcutta (P 5). Edited by Cunningham, *PASB.* 1874, p. 111, *StBh.* (1879), p. 20; 138, No. 83, and Pl. LV; Hultzsch *ɀDMG.* Vol. XL (1886), p. 70, No. 93, and Pl.; IA. Vol. XXI (1892), p. 234, No. 93; Barua-Sinha, BI. (1926), p. 67 f., No. 175; Barua, Barh.

TEXT:  
Ajakālako yakho

TRANSLATION:  
The Yaksha Ajakalaka.

 The figure to which the label is attached stands opposite to the figure of Kubera (B 1). He has the bud of a lotus in his right hand which rests on his chest, while his left hand hangs by his side holding some undefined object between the thumb and the forefinger. The figure stands on a monster with the body of a fish, but with human hands thrust into its mouth; thus according to the description of Anderson Cat. I, p. 24. Barua l.c. II, p. 61, says that the animal has the tail of a Makara and the forefeet of a lion or of a tiger. The picture is not clear enough to allow us to decide the question.

A Yaksha Ajakālaka is not known from other sources. In the *Mahām.* p. 231; 236 two Yakshas, Kāla and Upakāla, are mentioned, but they certainly have no connection

[^(\[1\])](partb9.html#_ftnref1)According to King quoted by Anderson, *Cat.* p. 23.
