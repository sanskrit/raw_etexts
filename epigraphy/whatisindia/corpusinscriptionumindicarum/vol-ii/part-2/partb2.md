**PART B**

**THE SCULPTURAL REPRESENTATIONS & THE TEXTUAL TRADITION**

Exactly the same is to be observed in the other commentary literature. In *DA.* page 674 Buddhaghosa refers to the Sammodamānaj. as Vaṭṭakaj., on page 178 to the Vidhurapaṇḍitaj. as Puṇṇakaj., besides on page 674 to the Daddabhaj. (322) as Paṭhavīuddīyanaj., on page 657 to the Dhammaddhajaj. (384) as Dhammikavāyasaj. In the *DhA.* in Vol 1, 55 the Sammodamānaj. is called Vaṭṭakaj., in Vol. IV, 83 the Telapattaj. bears the name Takkasilaj., and the Kachchhapaj. (215) is cited in Vol. IV, 92 as Bahubhāṇij. Such fluctuations in the titles of the Jātakas, however, must have existed already in the time when the Bhārhut reliefs were carved. Only in this way indeed it is understandable that in the inscription No. B 42 two labels Biḍalajata\[k\]a and Kukuṭajataka are given side by side as it were for choice.

 The reason for these fluctuations is also recognizable. At the time of the Bhārhut sculptures these titles were in no way literally fixed, but were used only as convenient short designations. In the beginning the different Jātakas did not have any real titles. The first Pāda of the first Gāthā was taken as the heading. This custom has been retained in the Jātaka-Atthavaṇṇanā, even where, on account of regroupings sometimes made by the author of the Atthavaṇṇanā, it did not suit any more. In the Vidhurapaṇḍitaj. (545) the heading is *paṇḍū kisiyāsi dubbalā.* This is indeed the first Pāda of the first Gāthā in the proper story of Vidhura and Puṇṇaka, but not of the Jātaka as it stands now in the Atthavaṇṇanā, because the story of the Chatuposathikaj. (441) from the Dasanipāta precedes it.[^(\[1\])](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/corpusinscriptionumindicarum_/vol-ii/part-2/partab2.html#_f%0Atn1) Likewise the Kosiyaj. (470) and 9 further Gāthās precede the proper story in the Sudhābhojanaj. (535)[^(\[2\])](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/corpusinscriptionumindicarum_/vol-ii/part-2/partab2.html#_f%0Atn2); the title, however, reads *naguttame or naguttame girivare,* which is the beginning of the first Gāthā in the proper story[^(\[3\])](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/corpusinscriptionumindicarum_/vol-ii/part-2/partab2.html#_f%0Atn3). The Mahāummaggaj. (546) opens in the Atthavaṇṇanā with a whole row of narrations that were independent Jātakas in the original collection : G. 2[^(\[4\])](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/corpusinscriptionumindicarum_/vol-ii/part-2/partab2.html#_f%0Atn4) belongs to the Sabbasaṁhārakapañha (110), G. 3 to the Gadrabhapañha (111), G. 4-5 belong to the Kakaṇṭakaj. (170), G. 6-7 to the Sirikāḷakaṇṇij. (192), G. 8-19 to the Meṇḍakaj. (471)[^(\[1\])](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/corpusinscriptionumindicarum_/vol-ii/part-2/partab2.html#_f%0Atn1), G. 20-40 to the Sirimandaj. (500), G. 41 to the Amarādevīpañha (112)[^(\[5\])](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/corpusinscriptionumindicarum_/vol-ii/part-2/partab2.html#_f%0Atn5), G. 43-47 to the Khajjopanakaj. (364), G. 48-57 to the Bhūripañhaj. (452), G. 58-61 to the Devatāpañhaj. (350), G. 62-83 to the Pañchapaṇḍitaj. (508).[^(\[6\])](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/corpusinscriptionumindicarum_/vol-ii/part-2/partab2.html#_f%0Atn6) The proper Mahāummaggaj. begins only with Gāthā 84 and the Pratīka of this Gāthā *Pañchālo sabhasenāya* therefore still appears in the Atthavaṇṇanā as the title. I regard it as most probable that the combination of several Jātakas had been undertaken by the author of the Atthavaṇṇanā himself who in this way wished to avoid repetitions in the prose-narrations. This regrouping will scarcely have been accomplished at the time of the origin of the Bhārhut sculptures. The label *yavamajhakiyaṁ jatakaṁ* (cf. B 52) will therefore not refer to the Mahāummaggaj. in its present form, but will only be the title of the story of Mahosadha and Amarādevī. This story, on account of its containing only one Gāthā (41), originally stood as J. 112 in the Ekanipāta where it is at present mentioned under the title Amarādevīpañha or Chhannapathapañha totally unsuitable for the story handed down to us in the Jātaka collection. The title *Yavamajjhakīyaṁ jātakaṁ* therefore, according to my opinion,

[^(\[1\])](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/corpusinscriptionumindicarum_/vol-ii/part-2/partb2.html#_ftnref1)G. 11 has probably been taken from the Sirimandaj. (500).  
[^(\[2\])](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/corpusinscriptionumindicarum_/vol-ii/part-2/partb2.html#_ftnref2)The Kosiyaj, stands in the Dvādasanipāta, therefore it should contain 12 Gāthās. Indeed there is in the tale of the avaricious Kosiya an evident conclusion after the 12th Gāthā. The nine following Gāthās are an amplification or a second version of the tale.  
[^(\[3\])](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/corpusinscriptionumindicarum_/vol-ii/part-2/partb2.html#_ftnref3)In the Burmese manuscript (B^(\[d\])) the heading has been changed to *neva kiṇāmi,* which is the beginning of the first Gāthā in the text of the Atthavaṇṇanā. The Burmese manuscript B⁸ still bears the old heading.  
[^(\[4\])](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/corpusinscriptionumindicarum_/vol-ii/part-2/partb2.html#_ftnref4)The stanza marked as G. 1 by Fausbōll is no Gāthā but an Uddāna which does not belong to the canonical text.  
[^(\[5\])](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/corpusinscriptionumindicarum_/vol-ii/part-2/partb2.html#_ftnref5)G. 42 is G. 58 anticipated in the prose narration.  
[^(\[6\])](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/corpusinscriptionumindicarum_/vol-ii/part-2/partb2.html#_ftnref6)Another Jātaka, the Dakarakkhasaj. (517), has also been incorporated into the proper Mahāummaggaj.
