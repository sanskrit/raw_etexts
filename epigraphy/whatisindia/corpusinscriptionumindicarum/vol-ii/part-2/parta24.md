[^(\[1\])](parta24.html#_ftnref1)From Cunningham’s eye-copy. The transcript has *Maragiri* and *Fitamitasa. Moragirami* is evidently a mistake for *Moragirima or Moragirimha. Fātamitasa* may be a mistake for *Fitamitasa* (‘one who subdued his friend’) or better *Fitāmitasa* (‘one who defeated his enemy’), but in the eye-copy the first *akshara* is distinctly *jā.*  
[^(\[2\])](parta24.html#_ftnref2)Under the assumption that Jitāmitra has to be understood, the name has been classified II, 3, a (names derived from wealth, fame, and birth).  
[^(\[3\])](parta24.html#_ftnref3)For *thabhā* see the remark on A 25.  
[^(\[4\])](parta24.html#_ftnref4)See classification I, 2, A, b (names derived from constellations).  
[^(\[5\])](parta24.html#_ftnref5)Lüders’ treatment of this inscription is missing.  
[^(\[6\])](parta24.html#_ftnref6)This is probably a clerical mistake for Moragirimhā to be found in A 27, A 29. The defec- tive spelling also appears in Moragirami (A 26).  
[^(\[7\])](parta24.html#_ftnref7)See classification II, 1, a (names derived from appearance of the body). It has been assumed, that *ghāṭa* and *ghāṭaka* are used in the measuring of “nape or back of the neckâ€?.
