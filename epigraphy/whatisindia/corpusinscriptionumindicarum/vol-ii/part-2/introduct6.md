**INTRODUCTION**

Sk. *Ṛishyasṛiṅgiya-\>Isis\[iṁ\]g\[iya\]* B 53[^(\[1\])](introduct6.html#_ftn1).  
(III) Change Sk. *ṛi\>u*:  
Sk. *naptri-\>natu-* A 50.  
Sk. *mātāpitṛi-\>māt\[a\]pitu-a* A 108.[^(\[2\])](introduct6.html#_ftn2)

 Â§ 2. Treatment of Sk. ayi and ava :- As is to be expected they become *e* and *a* respectively.

> \(I\) Change *ayi\>e* :  
> Sk. \* *krayitvā\> ketā* B 32. (But it is also possible to explain the
> form as coming from *krītvā\>\*kittā\>kettā.* Such a change, however,
> is not frequent in Bhārhut inscriptions.)  
> (II) Change *ava\>o:*  
> Sk. *Śravaṇā-\>Sonā-* A 123. (Perhaps this personal name may also he
> derived from *Suvarṇā¬─.)*  
> *Sk. vyavakrānta-* B 18. (Is it not possible to derive *vakata-* from
> Sk. *avakrānta-?* The initial v-may be a phonetic tendency to
> pronounce *v* before *o*.) Sk. *āmravat(a)-\>Aboda-* B 69.  
> Sk. *avakrānti-\>ūkraṁti- (i.e. akraṁti)* B 19. This is according to
> Hultzsch who considers the form as a mistake for *akraṁti─.* Lüders,
> however, would like to derive it from Sk. upakrānti-. In view of the
> fact that we do not get any long ū vowel before a cluster, it is
> better to regard *ū* as a mistake for o, the usual left horizontal
> stroke being put to the right by mistake. If, however, the reading *ū*
> is the correct one, then we better read the following letter as *k*
> and not *kr.* This *k* then will not stand for *kk* as the preceding
> vowel is lengthened ; cf. *Mahīdasena-*A 13.

 Â§ 3. Treatment of Sk. diphthongs ai and au :─ As usual they become *e* and *o,* except that *au* is supposed to have been preserved only in a solitary instance (see however below).

> \(I\) Change *ai\>e ;*  
> Sk. *Vaijayanta-\>Vejayaṁta-* B 22.  
> Sk. *Vaidiśa-\> Vedisa-* A 30, A 33, A 34.  
> Sk. *śaiksha-\>seccha-* B 45.  
> Sk. *–naikāyika-\>-nekāyika-* A 57.  
> Once Sk. *Chaitya-\>chātiya-* B 69. This is obviously a mistake, the
> top horizontal mark being put to the right by mistake instead of to
> the left. See above the probable mistake in *ūkraṁti- for akraṁti-.*  
> (II) Change *an\>o :*  
> Sk. *Gauptiputra-\>Gotiputa-* A 1.  
> Sk. *kauśala-\>kosala-* B 39.  
> (III) *au* is supposed to have been preserved in :  
> Sk. pautra-\>pauta- A 1. But this is highly improbable. The change
> *au\>o* is found in the very same inscription in the instance
> *Gotiputa-.* It is

[^(\[1\])](introduct6.html#_ftnref1) The change *ṛi\>i in śṛiṅga\>siṁga* is explained by H. Berger p. 30 to be due to the existence of the old palatal *ś.*  
[^(\[2\])](introduct6.html#_ftnref2) For the change of ṛi\>u in words of relationship as result of the influence of the gen. sg. forms like *pituḥ, mātuḥ* etc. see Ch. Bartholomae, *Ausgleichserscheinungen bei den ɀahlwörtern 2, 3 und 4 in Mittelindischen.* Mit einem Anhang Anhang: über pitunnaṁ, Sitzungsber. Heidelberger Akademie 1916, V, and H. Berger p. 60 ff.
