**INTRODUCTION**

therefore reasonable to suppose that the word really has to be read *poteṇa,* see the remark on the akshara *po* in note 1 of A 1.

 Â§4. Treatment of *e* and *o* : These sounds are normally preserved. The following incidental changes, however, may be noted :

> \(I\) Change e\>*i: Sk. Kubera-\>kupira─* B 1. Perhaps this betrays a
> tendency to pronounce the second syllable short, especially when a
> long syllable follows (the actual from used is *kupiro)*.  
> (II) o occurs for e obviously by mistake in Sk.
> *Miśrakeśi-\>Misakosi-* B 28.  
> (III) Change o\>*u* before a cluster is attested in Sk. *Nandottarā-\>
> Nadutara-*A 119.  
> (IV) *māchito* B 62 for *mochito* is obviously a mistake in the
> eye-copy, the putting in of the upper left horizontal mark having been
> forgotten.

 Â§5. Treatment of the vowel *a:* Though this vowel is fairly well preserved, it is possibly sometimes lengthened before a consonant cluster, and in a few cases it changes to *i* and *u* under the influence of y and m respectively.

> \(I\) Change *a\>ā* before a consonant cluster. ─It must be stated
> that clear cases of this type of change are really very few. Most of
> them seem to be hypothetical. (Note also that changes *i\>ī and u\>ū*
> in similar circumstances are rarely found.)  
> *Sk. Punarvasu─\>Punāvasu─* A 72. It is, however, possible that we get
> here a combination of *punā-*and *vasu, punā* itself being the form
> for *punar-.* Thus the changes of a \>ā in *Punāvasu* may not have
> anything to do with the cluster *rv;* cf.similar combinations in
> *Araha-guto* B 18, B 20, and chha-daṁtiya B 49.  
> Sk. *Aṅgāradyut─\>Āgaraju─* A 1. Here also the right horizontal mark
> in the middle supposed to be for *ā* is not very clear and seems
> accidental, exactly as in the case of *pauteṇa.* Note also that in the
> inscription A 2 line 2 we get *Agaraju─* with short *a*.  
> Sk. *Gaṅgāmitra─\>Gāgamita─* A 89.  
> Sk. *saṭṭaka─\>sāḍika─ B 27. But sāḍika –may go back to sāṭikā.*  
> The next are the three instances where *a\>ā* occurs in the genitive
> singular term. *–assa\>-āsa ;* cf.  
> *asavārikāsa* A 22, *Thupadāsāsa* A 25, *bhadaṁtāsa* A 38. Similarly
> we get a long vowel before a simplified cluster of
> *rājñaḥ\>\*rañño\>rāño* A 4; cf. also *Gāgiputa─* and *Vāchhiputa* in
> A 1.  
> (II) Writing of a as ā by mistake is found in *toranāṁ* A 1 *(cf. §
> 12, c), dān \[ā\]* A 49 a, *gajājātaka* B 42 a, *Bhāranideva─* A 100,
> *Dhamārakhitā* A 52, and *Bhutārakhita-* A 38.  
> (III) Change *a*\>i due to the influence of palatal *y* :  
> Sk. *nyagrodha─\>nigodha─* B 70.  
> Sk. *Ṛishyamṛiga─\>Isimiga─* B 48. (This is according to Lüders, all
> other editors derive it from *Ṛishimṛiga─.)*  
> Sk. *Ṛishyaśṛiṅga─\>Isisiṁga─* B 53.  
> (IV) Change *a\>u* due to the influence of labial *m :* Sk.
> *smaśāna─\>susāna─* B 64.[^(\[1\])](introduct7.html#_ftn1)

[^(\[1\])](introduct7.html#_ftnref1)The change *a*\>u in *susāna─* is explained by H. Berger as a result of *saṁprasāraṇa.* For this the author presupposes (18, 6. n. 13; also cf. p. 61, 66) a hypothetical form *\*śvaśāna- for smaśāna-.* But elsewhere the rounding of lips due to *m* is shown by Berger himself.
