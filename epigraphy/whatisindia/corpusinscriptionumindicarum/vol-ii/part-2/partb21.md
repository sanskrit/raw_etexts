**PART B**

Koṇāgamana *(D. I, 2 ff.; J.* I, 42 ff.; 94), while in the inscription on the pillar of Nigāli Sāgar it is written Konākamana. In Sanskrit literature it is distorted to Konākamuni *(Mvu.* II, 265; III, 240 f., 243; *Mahām.* p. 227) and, under the influence of popular etymology, to Kanakamuni *(Mvu.* I, 294; 318; *Lalitav. 5; Divy.* 333; Dharmasaṁgraha VI; *Mvp.* 2, 10; *Mahām.* p. 250). Kanakamuni, ‘Gold-Sage’, further gave rise to Kanakahvaya *(Lalitav.* 281 ; 283) and KaÃ±chana *(Hem. Abh.* 236).

***B 17 (760); PLATES XVII, XXXIII***

ON the same pillar as No. A 40, now in the Indian Museum, Calcutta (M 7). The inscription is engraved over a medallion below No. 40, but by a different hand. Edited by Cunningham, PASB. 1874, p. 115; *StBh.* (1879), p. 45; 114; 135, No. 49, and Pl. XXX and LIV; Hultzsch, ɀDMG. Vol. XL (1886), p. 67 No. 64 (second part), and Pl.; IA. Vol. XXI (1892), 232, No. 64 (second part); Barua-Sinha, BI. (1926), p. 41, No. 140; Barua, Barh. Vol. II (1934), p. 4, and Vol. III (1937), Pl. XXXVI (31); LÃ¼ders, *Bharh.* (1941), p. 26 ff.

TEXT:  
bhagavato Kasapasa bodhi

TRANSLATION:  
The Bodhi tree of the holy Kasapa *(Kaśyapa).*

 The medallion to which the label belongs is of the same type as the medallions described under Nos. B 13-16. The middle is occupied by a tree which by its leaves and berries is characterized as a Nyagrodha tree (Ficus indica), though the pendent roots are omitted, perhaps, as suggested by Cunningham, to make room for the many garlands hung up on the twigs. In front of the tree is a seat. On each side of it a woman is represented embracing the trunk of the tree, the one on the left keeling and the other on the right sitting on a *morhā* and turning the back to the spectator. On each side of the tree a man stands carrying a garland.

The sculpture, agrees with the literary tradition in representing the Banian tree as Kāśyapa’s Bodhi tree; see D. II, 4; J. I. 43; *Mahām.* p. 227.
