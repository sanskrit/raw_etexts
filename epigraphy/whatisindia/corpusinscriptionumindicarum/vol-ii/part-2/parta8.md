**PART A**

(1) The first group comprehends some renowned localities extending over a vast are from Pāṭaliputra (Patna) in the north-east of India to Nasik and Karhāḍ, places in the former Bombay Sate, in the West. Therefore it is obvious that Bhārhut attracted visitors not only from its vicinity but that pilgrims even from distant places flocked to the shrine or supported subscriptions to contribute to the embellishment and ornamentation of the monument. Important localities to be identified are :

*Karahakaṭa,* probably the modern Karhāḍ, in the district of Sātārā, Bombay State, about forty miles north of Kolhapur. The name reappears in the Kuḍā Buddhist cave inscription *(List* No. 1055) as Karahākaḍa, and seems to be the ancient form of the later Karahaṭaka, Karāḍ, the capital of one  of the branches of the Śilāhāra family.[^(\[1\])](parta8.html#_f%0Atn1)

*Kosambi (Sk. Kauśāmbī),* modern Kosam, on the left bank of the Jumna, about thirty miles to the west of Allahabad ; according to the Mahāparinibbānasutta it was one of the great Indian cities at the time of the Buddha, famous as capital of the Vatsas or Vaṁsas.[^(\[2\])](parta8.html#_f%0Atn2) To Kosambī our inscriptions refer only once (A 52). The nun Dhamarakhitā, inhabitant of Venuvagāma, is called Kosabeyikā *(Kauśāmbeyikā)* “native of Kosambiâ€?.

*Nasika,*[^(\[3\])](parta8.html#_f%0Atn3)the modern Nasik on the Godāvarī, 117 miles by train to the north-east of Bombay, a celebrated place of pilgrimage, known to archaeologists on account of some old cave-temples.

*Paṭaliputa (Pāṭaliputra),* modern Patna, the capital of Magadha in Maurya and Gupta times, founded by Ajātaśatru of Magadha as Pāṭaligāma in cr. 483 B.C., the last year of Buddha’s life. A description of the town as the residence of the Maurya Chandragupta has been given at the end of the fourth century B.C. by the Greek ambassador Megasthenes. For excavations see L. A. Wadell, *Report on Excavations at Pāṭaliputra* Calcutta 1903 ; D. B. Spooner, *Mr. Ratan* *Tata’s Excavations at Pāṭaliputra ASIAR.,* 1913-14, pp. 53-86.[^(\[4\])](parta8.html#_f%0Atn4)

*Purika,* according to the Khila-Harivaṃśa (Viṣṇuparvan XXXVIII, 20-22) a town between two ranges of the Vindhya mountains. The *Paurikas or Paulikas* are enumerated by different Purāṇas in the list of people in the Deccan after the *Daṇḍakas* and before the *Maulikas* And *Aśmakas*.[^(\[5\])](parta8.html#_f%0Atn5)

*Bhojakaṭa,* second capital of Vidarbha (Berar) ;[^(\[6\])](parta8.html#_f%0Atn6) probably to be identified with Bhojpur in Bhopal, six miles to the east south-east of Bhilsa. The Bhojpur topes have been described by Cunningham (‘Bhilsa Topes’) and some relic bowels with inscriptions have been found there *(List* No. 676-678).
