**TRANSLATION :**  
Descended from (the hall of ) the Great Assembly the angel Arahaguta *(Arhadgupta)* apprises the Holy One of (his future) reincarnation.

The interpretation of the inscription is to be based on the sculpture. The centre of the relief is occupied by a seat surmounted by a parasol from which pendants hang down. The surface of the seat is decorated with ornamental bands and covered with flowers and *pañchāṅgulikas.* On the foot-rest before the seat two foot prints are seen, placed side by side and each marked with a wheel. A large crowd has gathered round the seat. With the exception of one person kneeling before the seat and touching the right foot-print, all are standing with their hands joined in devotion. Two figures in the left lower corner are represented with wings, thus showing that the assembly consists not of men, but of gods. The kneeling figure undoubtedly is the devaputra Arhadgupta of the label. Barua and Sinha give a translation[^(\[4\])](partb22.html#_f%0Atn4) of the label which disregards the most elementary rules of grammar, and further they give an explanation of the sculpture which is quite opposed to it. They interpret the sculpture as the visit of Arhadgupta to the palace of Śuddhodana for paying homage to the newly born Boddhisattva and predicting the inception of the Law of the Divine teacher. A glance at the plate is sufficient to show the impossibility of this explanation. The older one of Hoernle is also untenable. Hoernle reads *dhokato* instead of *vokato* and takes it as a present participle of a verb *\*dhokkati* ‘ to greet respectfully’ which he infers from Hindi *dhok* or *ḍhok* ‘ obedient’, ‘greeting’. The two last words which he reads *sāsati patisaṁdhi(ṁ)* may mean, according to him, that Arahaguta praises the re-incarnation of the Buddha and in his opinion the relief refers to the â€˜great assemblyâ€™ in the Mahavana near Kapila

[^(\[1\])](partb22.html#_ftnref1)The *v* of *vokato* differs from the *v* of *devaputo* and *Bhagavato* by showing no vertical. But all other readings suggested for the *akshara* are out of question.  
[^(\[2\])](partb22.html#_ftnref2)As pointed out by Hultzsch, the left half of the o-sign of to is very short, but the reading to is practically certain.  
[^(\[3\])](partb22.html#_ftnref3)Read *sāsati.*  
[^(\[4\])](partb22.html#_ftnref4) “In the great assembly (of the gods) the future inauguration of the law of the Divine Master is being announced by the Angel Arhadgupta, the protector of the Arhats.â€?
