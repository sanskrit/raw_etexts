TRANSLATION:  
The plastering of the ṭana-walk (is) the gift of Ko.. dalaki(?).

Barua-Sinha divide this inscription into two parts and explain it as *koladalākiyāya dānaṁ* “The gift of Koladalākhya (?)” and *Vanacaṁkamo Pārireyo* “The woodland resort Pārileya”. On the latter inscription they add the following remark: “The label seems to have been attached to a scene of the grassy woodland, where the Buddha spent a rainy season, being waited upon and guarded by the elephant Pārileyyaka or Pāreraka………… The story of this elephant is given in the Mahāvagga of the Vinaya-Piṭaka, the Kosambī-Jātaka of the Jātaka-Comy. (F. No. 428), and the Kosambakavatthu of the Dhammapada-Comy.â€?.

LÃ¼ders, whose treatment of the inscription has not come to our hands, remarks, while dealing with the *chaṅkamas* (l.c.), that probably a third *chaṅkama* ws depicted in Bharhut.

[^(\[1\])](parta61.html#_ftnref1)Barua-Sinha propose to combine our fragment with the inscription No. A 35 where the usual *dānam* is missing. This is quite conjectural.  
[^(\[2\])](parta61.html#_ftnref2)Lüders’ treatment of this inscription is missing.  
[^(\[3\])](parta61.html#_ftnref3)From the eye-copy of Cunningham. The right part of the inscription is broken off.  
[^(\[4\])](parta61.html#_ftnref4)Perhaps the name means: ‘one who has a residence’. Accordingly it has been classified under II, 3, b (names derived from wealth, fame, and birth).  
[^(\[5\])](parta61.html#_ftnref5)Barua-Sinha suggest to complete the inscription as *Āvāsikā( ya bhikhuniyā dānaṁ)* “The gift of a nun of the local monastic abode.” Their reference to *āvāsika-bhikkhu* ‘resident monk’ which is opposed to *āgantuka-bhikkhu* ‘visiting monk’ in this connection does not give sufficient support to the restoration proposed by them.  
[^(\[6\])](parta61.html#_ftnref6)From Cunningham’s eye-copy.
