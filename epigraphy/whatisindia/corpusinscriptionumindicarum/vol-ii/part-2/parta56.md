The relief containing this inscription (carried away to Uchahara) is a replica of the scene described under B 39. It presents the procession of king Prasenajit of Kosala around the Dharmaśālā erected as a memorial of Buddha’s first preaching in the city of Śrāvastī. The edifice, the wheel and the two figures on both sides of the wheel are nearly the same as those in the relief of the southern gate. A stone seat, however, in front of the wheel, on both sides of which a women is kneeling, is added here. The standing figures are bigger than the representations of the kneeling women and this perhaps characterizes them as gods. In both reliefs a procession moves around the edifice. To the right, a chariot on which two men are standing and which is drawn by two horses is seen. To the left, a man on horse-back rides through the entrance gate. In front of him an elephant goes having a man on its back, shown in side-view in a very clumsy way. The elephant with its truck gets hold of the branch of a tree hanging above.

 On the roof of the edifice stands our inscription, the beginning of which is destroyed. Cunningham read it as *….. sa dānaṁ Atenā Charata;* Barua-Sinha divide the inscription into a donative inscription and a *‘Jātaka label’,* and, remembering the words *attanā marantāpi*[^(\[2\])](parta56.html#_f%0Atn2) in the Viḍūḍabhavatthu of the DhA., change the last words of the inscription to atanā maraṁtā. They remark, “The recorded scene is apparently that of Viḍūḍabha’s invasion of Kapilavastu and non-violent attitude of the Śākyas.” For the curious interpretations required to bring this explanation in union with the real depiction in the scene, the reader may look up Barua’s work *(Barh.,* II, p. 48 ff.).

 The occurrence of the word *dānaṁ* clearly shows that the inscription does not refer to the scene represented in the relief, but that it is only a donative inscription emphasizing that besides paying the cost of the stone the donor himself had carved the relief.
