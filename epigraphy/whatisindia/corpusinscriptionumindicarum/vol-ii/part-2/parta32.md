**PART A**

TRANSLATION:  
The gift of Sirimā *(Srīmatī)*[^(\[1\])](parta32.html#_f%0Atn1), the Parakaṭikā (inhabitant of *Parakaṭa*)-

A 49 (836); PLATE XXIV

ON a rail-bar of the South-Western quadrant. Original lost. Edited by Cunningham, *StBh.* (1879), p. 140, No. 21, and Pl. LV; Barua-Sinha, BI. (1926), p. 21, No. 71.

**TEXT:**  
Golayā Pārikiniyā dānaṁ[^(\[2\])](parta32.html#_f%0Atn2)

**TRANSLATION:**  
The gift of Golā,[^(\[3\])](parta32.html#_f%0Atn3) the Pārikinī (inhabitant of *Parikina*).

Barua-Sinha, following Cunningham, translate the inscription: ‘The gift of Pārikiṇī from Golā’. As the epithet indicating the native place of the donor of placed sometimes before and sometimes after the personal name, and as *Golā* occurs as a female name in the Sāñchī inscription *List* No. 596, there can be no doubt that here also *Golā* is the personal name. *Pārikinī* then is probably derived from the name of a place. With *Parikina* may be compared *Dharakina* in No. 259 of my *List* and *Dabhina,* From which *Dabhinikā* is derived in No. A 42.

**TEXT:**  
Tis\[a\]ya Benākaṭikāya dān\[a\][^(\[4\])](parta32.html#_f%0Atn4)

**TRANSLATION:**  
The gift of Tisā *(Tishyā),* the Benākaṭikā (inhabitant of *Benākaṭa*)[^(\[5\])](parta32.html#_f%0Atn5).

**A 50 (721) ; PLATE VII**

ON a pillar of the South-Eastern quadrant, now in the Indian Museum, Calcutta (No. 6510).[^(\[6\])](parta32.html#_f%0Atn6) Edited by Cunningham, StBh. (1879), p. 132, No. 10, and Pl. LIII; Barua-Sinha, BI. (1926), p. 7, No. 11.

[^(\[1\])](parta32.html#_ftnref1) See classification I, 4, b, 3 (names derived from minor deities).  
[^(\[2\])](parta32.html#_ftnref2) From Cunningham’s eye-copy which agrees with his transcript.  
[^(\[3\])](parta32.html#_ftnref3) See classification II, 1, b (names derived from appearance of the body).  
[^(\[4\])](parta32.html#_ftnref4) *dān\[ā\]* may be a mistake for *dāna=dānaṁ.* The final anusvāra is sometimes not represented, see above § 25 (ii). It is hardly believable that *dānā* has been used in the plural number for *dānāni.*  
[^(\[5\])](parta32.html#_ftnref5) Benākaṭa is a place-name ending in *kaṭa* like others mentioned above p. 7. In a Nāsik Buddhist Cave inscription, *List* No. 1125, we find Gotamiputa Siri-Sadakaṇi *(Gautamiputra Śrī-Śātakarṇii)* called “lord *(svāmin)* of Benākaṭaka of Govadhana *(Govardhana)*”. According to Bimala Churn Law *(Historical Geography of Ancient India,* Paris \[1954\], p. 301, s. v. *Veṇākaṭaka*) the place was situated on the Veṇva river in the Nasik district. Nundo Lal Dey *(The Geographical Dictionary of Ancient and Mediaeval India,* 2nd ed. 1927, p. 29) mentions “Benakataka” as “Warangal, the capital of Teliṅgana or Andhra”; l.c. p. 28 he gives “Bena” as “the river Wain-Gaṅgā in the Central Provinces”, “a tributary of the Godāvari”.  
[^(\[6\])](parta32.html#_ftnref6) See *ASIAR.,* 1925/26, p. 148, Note 1, and p. 297, No. 48.
