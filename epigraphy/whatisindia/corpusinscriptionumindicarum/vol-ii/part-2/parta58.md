**PART A**

TRANSLATION:  
The gift of Yakhī *( Yakshi)*[^(\[1\])](parta58.html#_f%0Atn1), the Koḍiya.

LÃ¼ders in his*List* translates this inscription as ‘gift of a yakhī *(yakshī)* by Koḍā *(Kroḍā)’,* taking *yakhī* as the object of donation[^(\[2\])](parta58.html#_f%0Atn2) and Koḍā as the donor. That a *yakhī* is the object of the gift is not probable as the inscription is not attached to a pillar. On the other hand *Yakhī* occurs as the name[^(\[3\])](parta58.html#_f%0Atn3) of a nun not less than three times in the Brāhmī inscriptions, see *List* Nos. 254, 344, and 500. For the interpretation of *Koḍā* as a women belonging to the Koḍya or Koliya tribe cf. Lüders’ explanation of *Koḍiyānī* in A 14, A 15 and of *Koḍāyo* in No. B 72. A *Koḍa Kalavāḍa* also appears in the Vakālā stone inscription, *List* No. 971.
