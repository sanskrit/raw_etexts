**PART B**

the man by the deity residing in the jambū tree. Another man is walking away carrying a small vessel which he apparently has filled at the tree. According to Anderson, *Cat.* Vol. I, p. 97, there is on the right a block of stone exactly like those of the relief described under No. B 73.

 The same scene, with slight modifications, occurs in a relief at Buddha-Gayā reproduced in Cunningham’s Mahābodhi, Plate VIII, No. 4. Here the man who receives the water of donation and the bowl with food from the tree-spirit is standing by the side of a *māṛhā* and a bench, and the man walking off is missing, but the block of stone appears here also in the background. Bloch[^(\[1\])](partb104.html#_f%0Atn1) referred the scene of the Buddha-Gayā sculpture to the feeding of the Bodhisattva by Sujātā. I am unable to discover the slightest resemblance between the relief and that story[^(\[2\])](partb104.html#_f%0Atn2).

 Barua-Sinha translate *jabū* by ‘ the rose-apple trees ’, which is not in keeping with the sculpture where only a single tree is represented. But I see no reason why *jabū* should be taken as a plural form, *jambū* being the regular nom. sing. of the feminine base, both in Pāli[^(\[3\])](partb104.html#_f%0Atn3) and Prakrit. I quite agree with Barua-Sinha in rejecting Hoernle’s suggestion that the jambū tree of the relief is the tree on Mount Meru from which *Jambudvīpa* derives its name.

On the other hand I fail to see how it should possibly be connected with the jambū trees mentioned among other trees in Gāthā 584 of the Vessantarajātaka or with the Sambulajātaka (519), as suggested by those two scholars. R P. Chanda[^(\[4\])](partb104.html#_f%0Atn4) and Coomaraswamy[^(\[5\])](partb104.html#_f%0Atn5) see in the relief the representation of a legend narrated in the DhA. I, 203 ff. There we are told that five hundred ascetics on their way from the Himālaya to Kosambī come to a great nyagrodha tree in a forest. The goddess of the tree gives them food and water to drink and to bathe. At the request of the oldest of the group of ascetics she comes out of the tree and informs the ascetics that she had gained great power for having fasted unto death in a former life as a workmaid of Anāthapiṇḍika. Now the relief corresponds to the story as far as the miraculous feeding by the tree-goddess is concerned. But I am very doubtful whether just this story is illustrated. The tree in the relief is a jambū tree, in the story, however, it is a nyagrodha. That speaks against the identification, as well as the circumstance that the men being fed and offered a drink in the relief are not ascetics. Hoernle’s[^(\[6\])](partb104.html#_f%0Atn6) explanation of the Bhārhut relief is quite mistaken, and Barua himself withdrew the curious explanation he gave (BI. p. 97 f. and *Barh.* II, p. 162 ff.) later on in *Barh.* III, p. 4.[^(\[7\])](partb104.html#_f%0Atn7) The story of the jambū tree represented in the relief is one of the Naḍoda legends which have not yet been discovered in literary sources; cf. the remarks on No. B 73.

FRAGMENTARY inscription on a coping-stone, now lost. Edited by Cunningham, *StBh.* (1879), p. 131, No. 22, and Pl. LIII. The inscription appears to be identical with the fragment published by Cunningham, ibid. p. 143, No. 18, and Pl. LVI. It was edited again by Barua-Sinha, BI. (1926), p. 86, No. 201 ; Barua, *Barh.* Vol. II (1934), p. 115; Lüders, *Bhārh.* (1941), p. 89 f.
