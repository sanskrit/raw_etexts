[^(\[1\])](parta64.html#_ftnref1)LÃ¼ders’ treatment of this inscription is missing.  
[^(\[2\])](parta64.html#_ftnref2)From the eye-copy of Cunningham. The right part of the inscription is broken off.  
[^(\[3\])](parta64.html#_ftnref3)See inscription I, 2, A, a (names derived from constellations).  
[^(\[4\])](parta64.html#_ftnref4)From the eye-copy of Cunningham. The left part of the inscription is broken off.  
[^(\[5\])](parta64.html#_ftnref5)This translation is only a tentative one. It assumes that the letter *dā* is left out before *na\]* and that this inscription was to end in *(dā)na(ṁ).* Barua-Sinha interpret the inscription as *paṁchāsanaṁ* ‘the five seats’ and see therein a reference to a “scene of the five spots in Uruvilvā, where the Buddha stayed five weeks, one week on each spot, after attainment of Buddhahood”. If the inscription would refer to the five seats we should expect *āsanāni* and not *āsanaṁ ;* moreover there is no mentioning of specific seats of the Buddha during his stay in Uruvilvā but of his taking seat under different trees, cf. Waldschmidt, *Vergleichende Analyse des Catusparisatsūtra,* Festschrift Schubring, Hamburg 1951, p. 87 f.  
[^(\[6\])](parta64.html#_ftnref6)From the eye-copy of Cunningham. The inscription is broken off on both sides.  
[^(\[7\])](parta64.html#_ftnref7)This translation is a tentative one. Lüders in his *List* said: ‘No sense can be made out’. Barua-Sinha have “The gift of Yānika (the inhabitant of a place, the name of which is missing except the last three syllables) *yasiniâ€?.*
