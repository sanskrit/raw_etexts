**PART A**

**A 4 (882)^(\[1\]); PLATE II**

RAIL inscription, now in the Indian Museum, Calcutta.─Edited by Cunningham, *StBh.* (1879), Pl. LVI, No. 67 (Plate only) ; Hultzsch, *ɀDMG.,* Vol. XL (1886), p. 60; IA., Vol. XXI (1829), p. 225 ; Barua-Sinha, BI. (1926), p. 33, No. 115.

**TEXT:**

â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦â€¦kasa raÃ±o bhayaye Nāgarakhitāye dānaṁ

**TRANSLATION:**

Gift of Nagarakhitā *(Nāgarakshitā)*^(\[2\]), the wife of king ……â€¦.. ka.

 Hultzsch proposed to read *tisa* instead of *kasa* in the beginning of the inscription and was of the opinion that the name of the king should be reconstruction as Dhanabhūti, the king mentioned in A1 and A3. In this he was followed by Lüders *(List)* and Barua-Sinha. The impression on the estampages, however, does not bear out that reading. As no king’s name ending in –*ka* appears in the Bhārhut inscriptions it is difficult to make any suggestion about the name of the king whose wife Nāgarakshitā was.
