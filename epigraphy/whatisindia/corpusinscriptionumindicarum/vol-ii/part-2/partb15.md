**PART B**

TEXT:  
yakhini Sudasana[^(\[1\])](partb15.html#_f%0Atn1)

TRANSLATION:  
The Yakshiṇī Sudasana *(Sudarsana).*

The label refers to a female figure raising her right hand and standing on a *makara.* Sudarśana occurs as the name of a Yaksha in the *Mahām.* p. 231, also of a Nāgarāja, *ibid.* 246 (cp. B 37), but Sudarśanā does not seem to be known in Buddhist literature. In the *Mbh.* 13, 2, 4 ff., Sudarśanā is the daughter of king Duryodhana of Māhishmatī and the river goddess *(devanadi)* Narmadā. She was so beautiful that Agni fell in love with her and married her. I am inclined to identify the Sudarśanā of the Epic with the Yakshiṇī represented in the sculpture. The daughter of a river goddess and wife of a god may well have been called a Yakshiṇī in the language of this time, and her *vāhana,* the *Makara,* seems to indicate that she was the child of a river and perhaps a river goddess herself, just as her daughter-in-law Oghavatī, of whom it is said in the *Mbh.* that half of her became a river (ibid. V. 168). Her descent from the river Narmadā and the king of Māhishmatī shows that she has been a local deity of Central India. She could therefore be very well known and adored in Bhārhut also.

TEXT:  
Chalakoka devata

TRANSLATION:  
The goddess Chulakoka (Little *Koka*).

 The goddess is represented standing on an elephant under an Aśoka tree in full flower.[^(\[2\])](partb15.html#_f%0Atn2) With her right hand she grasps a branch above her head, while her left arm and her left leg embrace the stem of the tree which is entwined also by the elephant’s tusk. The goddess has a counterpart in the goddess Mahākokā represented on a pillar at Pataora (No. B 12). Barua-Sinha boldly translate Kokā by hunter-goddess, but there is absolutely nothing in the outward appearance of the goddess nor in her name to warrant this meaning. Sk. *koka* denotes the wolf, the *chakravāka* and a certain insect. Lexicographers give it also the meaning of frog and date-tree and quote it as a surname of Vishṇu. As a personal name it occurs already in the Ś.Br. and Koka is perhaps the name of a river. But *koka* has nowhere the meaning of dog,[^(\[3\])](partb15.html#_f%0Atn3) as supposed by Barua-Sinha, and the fact that in the

[^(\[1\])](partb15.html#_ftnref1)The first *akshara* has an *i-*sign and an *u-*sign.  
[^(\[2\])](partb15.html#_ftnref2)I do not understand how Barua-Sinha can declare that it may be a date-palm.  
[^(\[3\])](partb15.html#_ftnref3)That *kokā* in J. 547, 302 does not mean dog, but wolf, was shown long ago by Cowell and Rouse, J., Vol. V, p. 273, note 1.
