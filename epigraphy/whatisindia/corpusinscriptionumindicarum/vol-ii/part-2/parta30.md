TEXT:  
Pusadataye Nagarikaye bhikhuniye^(\[4\])

TRANSLATION:  
(The gift) of the nun Pusadatā *(Pushyadattā),*^(\[2\]) the Nāgarikā (inhabitant of *Nagara)*.

This inscription first published by Mr. Sircar in 1948 is very similar to A 43. The differences are that in A 43 we read *Nagarikaya bhichhuniye* whereas the present inscription, according to Mr. Sircar, has *Nāgarikāye bhikhaniye.*^(\[5\]) Mr. Sircar first read a doubtful *sa* at the end of the inscription, perhaps because he accepted the combination of A 43 and A 124, following a suggestion made by Barua-Sinha but rejected by Lüders under A 124. In his second article Dr. Sircar came to the conclusion that the epigraph ends with the word *bhikhuniye* and translated the record: â€œ(The gift) of Pushyadatta, the nun of the city.â€?

*A 45 (852); PLATE VII*

ON a rail-bar, now in the Indian Museum, Calcutta (C.B. 48). Edited by Cunningham, *StBh.* (1879), p. 141, No. 37, and Pl. LVI; Hultzsch, *ɀDMG.,* Vol. XL (1886), p. 74, No. 132, and Pl., and IA., Vol. XXI (1892), p. 237, No. 132; Barua-Sinha, BI. (1926), p. 24, No. 87.

^(\[1\]) From Cunningham’s eye-copy. His transcript has Nagarikaye. Supply dānaṁ at the end.  
^(\[2\]) See classification I, 2, A, b (names derived from constellations).  
^(\[3\]) Lüders, of course, had no knowledge of this new discovery. A 43 and A 44, both mentioning the place name Nagara, were for a time-a rubbing not being available-considered to be identical, others wise they would have been inserted after A 12.  
^(\[4\]) As read by Mr. Sircar in his second article. Possibly the inscription has *Nagarikaya* as in A 48.  
^(\[5\]) Note, however, that in our inscriptions the genitive sg.-ye is found elsewhere with the base *bhichhunī* and not with *bhikhunī,* see § 29 (III).
