TEXT:  
haṁsajātakaṁ[^(\[2\])](partb55.html#_f%0Atn2)

TRANSLATION:  
The Jataka of the mallard.

 The Jataka was identified by Cunningham with the Nachchajātaka, No. 32 of the Pālī collection, which contains the well-known story of the Golden Mallard, the king of the birds, who allows his daughter to choose a husband after her own heart from amongst his subjects. Her choice falls on the peacock, who overjoyed begins to dance and in doing so exposes himself. Shocked at this indelicacy, the king of birds refuses him his daughter. The sculpture is fragmentary. The lower half and portions of both sides are broken off, but enough remains to show that it represented a mallard and to the right of it a peacock with outspread tail. If the fragment, a photograph of which has been published together with the drawing, formed part of the sculpture, some more mallards are represented in the lower left corner showing their back to the exposed peacock.

[^(\[2\])](partb55.html#_ftnref2)Cunningham’s eye-copy has *haṁsajātaka.* The editors would prefer to translate *haṁsa* by ‘wild gander’.

[^(\[4\])](partb55.html#_ftnref1) *ra* may be a clerical error for *ka.*
