 [^(\[1\])](contents.html#_ftnref1) Hultzsch states in his German paper on Bhārhut inscriptions (ZDMG. Vol. XL, 1886), p. 59, that 38 of the inscriptions, the eye-copied of which had been published by General Cunningham in *StBh.,* have not been removed to Calcutta. For that reason estampages of them could not be made by him in 1885, when he prepared his article. The same conditions are prevalent till now. Some 40-50 inscriptions, part of them fragmentary, have to be taken as lost or supposed to remain somewhere “in situ ”. For them the readings can rely only upon the unauthentic eye-copies published in *StBh.,* and reproduced from them in the plates below. All the cases in which the eye-copies alone are available have been noted as such.- Cf., however, postscript 1958 to preface, above p. VI.
