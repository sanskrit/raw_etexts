The four or five *aksharas* missing before *bhāriyāya* must have contained the name of the husband of the donatrix, whose own name seems to have been Kachulā, cf. Chāpadevāya Revatimitabhāriyāya No. A 34. Barua-Sinha’s restoration is wrong.

[^(\[1\])](parta57.html#_ftnref1)For donations of women whose native places have been mentioned see No. A 9 (fragmentary), A 10, A 14, A 15, A 18-20, A 27, A 28, A 32-35, A 45, A 46, A 48, A 49, A 53.  
[^(\[2\])](parta57.html#_ftnref2)See classification II, 2, b (name derived from mental disposition and temperament).  
[^(\[3\])](parta57.html#_ftnref3)From Cunningham’s eye-copy. In the transcript the first word is given as *Kachulasa,* but the fourth *akshara* may be a mutilated *ya.*  
[^(\[4\])](parta57.html#_ftnref4)See classification II, 1, b (names derived from dress).  
[^(\[5\])](parta57.html#_ftnref5)Lüders’ treatment of this inscription is missing.  
[^(\[6\])](parta57.html#_ftnref6)To the right of the lower portion of the letter ḍā the estampage shows a dot which could be read as *ṃ* if it were not so low. It is perhaps only accidental. *Koḍāya* is probably a clerical error for *Koḍiyāya.*
