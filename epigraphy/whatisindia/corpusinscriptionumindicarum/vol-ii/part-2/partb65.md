**PART B**

forest *(vanyaṁ vāsaḥ)* although he makes the hunter say that when he goes hunting he is accustomed to put on *kāshāya* in order to produce from a distance trust in the mind of the deer *(ārād anena viśvāsya mṛigān nihanmi).* In the prose of the Chandakinnaraj. (IV, 283, 16) it is also mentioned, without giving any special cause, that the king of Benares when he went hunting put on two *kāsāyāni,* and it is not necessary to imagine the *kāshāya* of the hunter as the robe of a Buddhist monk. The *kāshāya* which, according to the prose of the Jātakas, is worn by the executioner[^(\[1\])](partb65.html#_f%0Atn1), and according to the *Āśvalāyana Gṛihyas,* 1, 19, 11 by the young Brahmin students, will have been scarcely different from the kāshāya of the hunter. Therefore in this respect it is not necessary to suppose that the sculptor of Bhārhut has deviated from the story as it is given by the Gathas.

The matter seems to be different with regard to the second deviation on which Foucher lays much stress. In the relief the hunter cuts the teeth of the elephant with a saw, exactly as on the medallion from Amarāvatī, on a fresco at Ajaṇṭā, and a freeze from Gandhāra. According to the Gāthās he uses a khura for this purpose. In G. 31 the elephant says to the hunter: *uṭṭhehi tvaṁ ludda khuraṁ gahetvā dante ime chhinda purā marāmi,* and accordingly in the narrative Gāthā 32 we read *utthāya so luddo khuraṁ gahetvā chhetvāna dantāni gajuttamassa.* In the prose the instrument used is a *kakacha,* a saw (V, 52, 12 f.), and accordingly in the grammatical commentary of G. 31 *khuraṁ* is also explained by *kakachaṁ.* Foucher is of the opinion that the commentator goes too far when he wants us to believe that knives are saws, ‘autrement dit que les vessies sont des lanternes’. Now indeed I am also inclined to see in the commentator a man who generally is not very much worried by scruples, whether in linguistic or in material questions. Nevertheless some doubts may have come to him, as perhaps also to others, whether it is possible to cut elephant-teeth with a razor─this undoubtedly is the meaning of *khura.* In this case, however, I believe that he is not to be blamed for he merely became the victim of a corruption of the text. In other cases in the Gāthās where we hear of the cutting of elephant’s tusks the instrument used is called *khara.* In J. 545, 10 it is said *achchhechchhi kaṁkhaṁ vichikichchhitāni chundo yathā nāgadantaṁ kharena,* ‘you have cut off doubts and hesitations like a chunda[^(\[2\])](partb65.html#_f%0Atn2) an elephant tooth with the khara’. In J. 234,1 Asitābhū says to her husband who has faithlessly left her that her love for him has vanished: *so’ yam appaṭisandhiko kharachchhinnaṁ[^(\[3\])](partb65.html#_f%0Atn3) va rerukaṁ* ‘it is not again to be joined together as an elephant-tooth[^(\[4\])](partb65.html#_f%0Atn4) cut by a *khara’*. The commentator explains *khara* in both places as *kakacha* ‘saw’ and although the word is missing in Sanskrit we do not have any reason to doubt the correctness of his explanation, particularly because the Abhidhānappadīpikā 967 also gives the meaning ‘saw’ for *khara.* Therefore the supposition lies at hand that also in the Chhaddantaj. *khuraṁ* has been corrupted from *kharaṁ,* which is more rare, and in fact the Burmese manuscript reads *kharaṁ* at all places. On account of this I am quite sure that even according to the Gāthās the instrument used by the hunter was a saw as well as in the other representations mentioned above, and that the Gāthās therefore do not reflect, as Foucher supposes, a version of the story older than the Bhārhut relief.

[^(\[2\])](partb65.html#_ftnref2)According to the context *chunda* seems to be a worker in ivory. The commentary explains the word by *dantakāra.* There must have been, however, a difference between the *chundas* and the *dantakāras* for in the list of craftsmen in *Mil.* 331 both appear separately: the *chundas* are places between the *kappakas* (barbers), and *nahāpakas* (bath attendants) on one side and the *mālākāras* (garland-makers), *suvaṇṇakāras* (goldsmiths), *sajjhakāras* (silversmiths) etc. on the other, whereas the dantakāras appear between the *chammakāras* (leather-workers), and *rathakāras* (chariot-markers) on the one side and the *rajjukāras* (rope-makers) and the *kochechhakāras* (comb-makers) on the other. *Chunda* is probably the general expression for ‘turner’ and is the same as *chundakāra* which in J. VI, 339, 12 certainly designates a turner.  
[^(\[3\])](partb65.html#_ftnref3)Thus we have to read instead of *kharā chhinnam.*  
[^(\[4\])](partb65.html#_ftnref4)This is the meaning of the word *reruka* according to the commentary.
