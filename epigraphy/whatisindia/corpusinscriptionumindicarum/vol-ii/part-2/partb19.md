TEXT:  
bhagavato Vesabhuṇā[^(\[1\])](partb19.html#_f%0Atn1) bodhi sālo

TRANSLATION:  
The Bodhi tree of the holy Vesabhu *(Viśvabhū),*a Sala tree.

The medallion represents a Sāla tree (Shorea robusta) hung with garlands, with a seat decorated with flowers in front of it. On the top of the seat, under an umbrella, there is a *chakra* surmounted by a *triśūla.* Two worshippers are kneeling on each side of the seat, a man to the left and a woman to the right. Behind the man there is a woman holding a garland and behind the woman a man scattering small objects, probably flowers, from a small bowl which he holds in his left hand.

 The Sāla tree is mentioned in Pāli *(D. II, 4; J.* I. 42) and in the *Mahām.* p. 227 as the tree under which Viśvabhū obtained enlightenment. The addition of *sālo* in the inscription makes it certain that *bodhi* is used here in the sense of Bodhi tree as is frequently done in Pāli and Sanskrit literature[^(\[2\])](partb19.html#_f%0Atn2), and the presence of human worshippers in the relief affords additional proof that the sculpture illustrates, not the enlightenment of the Buddha, as supposed by Bloch[^(\[3\])](partb19.html#_f%0Atn3), but the worship of the Bodhi tree as a *pāribhogika chaitya.* The name of the Buddha is the same as in Pāli *(Vessabhū).* In Sanskrit it appears as *Viśvabhū;* the nominative *Viśvabhuk (Mvp. 2, 8; Mahām.* p. 227)[^(\[4\])](partb19.html#_f%0Atn4) is, of course, due to wrong Sanskritisation.
