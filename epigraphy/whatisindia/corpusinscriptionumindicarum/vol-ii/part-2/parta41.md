**PART A**

TRANSLATION:  
The pillar (is) the gift of the reverend Mahila.[^(\[1\])](parta41.html#_f%0Atn1)

 According to LÃ¼ders *Mahila* is probably a shortened form of a compound name such as *Mahipālita* or *Mahirakkhita.* The suffix –(i)la, (i)lā is, however, common in personal names, s. Hilka, l.c. pp. 68 f., and above p. XXVIII on suffixes (9). Barua-Sinha’s derivation from *Madhvila* is phonetically impossible, the correction to *Mihila* is unnecessary.

***A 66 (768); PLATE IX***

ON a pillar of the South-Western quadrant, now in the Indian Museum, Calcutta (P 2), where also B 52 is found. Edited by Cunningham, StBh. (1879), p. 136, No. 57, and Pl. LIV ; Hultzsch, *ɀDMG.,* Vol. XL (1886), p. 68, No. 71, and Pl., and IA., Vol. XXI (1892), p. 233, No. 71; Barua-Sinha, *BI.* (1926), p. 12 No. 28.

TEXT:  
bhadata-Samakasa thabho dānaṁ

TRANSLATION:  
The pillar (is) the gift of the reverend Samaka *(Śyamaka)*[^(\[2\])](parta41.html#_f%0Atn2).

 *Samakasa* may be a clerical error for *Samikasa,* But it is more probably a defective writing for *Sāmakasa,* as *Sāmaka* occurs as the name of a monk also in A 73, and of different persons in the Nāsik inscription *List* No. 1126 and the Bhaṭṭiprolu inscription *List* No. 1337.

***A 67 (842) ; PLATE X***

ON a rail-bar, now in the Indian Museum, Calcutta (C. B. 22). Edited by Cunningham, *StBh.* (1879), p. 140, No. 27, and Pl. LVI ; Hultzsch, *ɀDMG.,* Vol. XL (1886), p. 73, No. 122, and Pl., and IA., Vol. XXI (1892), p. 236, No. 122 ; Ramaprasad Chanda, *MASI.,* No. 1 (1919), p. 19, No. 1, and Pl. V; Barua-Sinha, BI. (1926), p. 22, No. 77.

TEXT:  
aya-Apikinakasa dānaṁ

TRANSLATION:  
The gift of the venerable Apikinaka *(Apigirṇaka ?)*[^(\[3\])](parta41.html#_f%0Atn3)

*Apikinaka* is found again in the form *Aṁpikiṇaka* as the name of a Buddhist monk in the Bhājā inscription, *List* No. 1081 ; Barua-Sinha’s derivation of the name from Sk. *Aprakīrṇa* is quite unlikely.

***A 68 (715) ; PLATE X***

ON a pillar of the South-Eastern quadrant, now in the Indian Museum, Calcutta (P 13). Edited by Cunningham, *StBh.* (1879), p. 132, No. 4, and Pl. LIII; Hultzsch, *ɀDMG.,* Vol.
