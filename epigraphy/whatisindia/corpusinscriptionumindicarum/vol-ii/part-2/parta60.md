**PART A**

TRANSLATION:  
The gift of Samidatā *(Svamidatta)*[^(\[1\])](parta60.html#_f%0Atn1).

***A 123 (758); PLATE XV***

ON a pillar of the South-Western quadrant, now in the Indian Museum, Calcutta (NS. 6500)[^(\[2\])](parta60.html#_f%0Atn2). Edited by Cunningham, *StBh.* (1879), p. 135, No. 47, and Pl. LIV; Barua-Sinha, BI. (1926), p. 11, No. 20[^(\[3\])](parta60.html#_f%0Atn3).

TEXT:  
Sonāya dānaṁ thabha[^(\[4\])](parta60.html#_f%0Atn4)

TRANSLATION:  
The pillars (are) the gift of Sonā *(Śravaṇā)*[^(\[5\])](parta60.html#_f%0Atn5).

The gift of more than one pillar by the same person is recorded also in the inscriptions A 25, A 27, A 29, A 124.

***A 124 (803); PLATE XXV***

FRAGMENTARY inscription on a pillar, now at Batanmāra. Edited by Cunningham, StBh. (1879), p. 138, No. 90, and Pl.; Barua-Sinha, BI. (1926), p. 16, No. 43.

TEXT:  
.. .. .. sakāya thabhā dānaṁ[^(\[6\])](parta60.html#_f%0Atn6)

TRANSLATION:  
The pillars (are) the gift of …â€¦.. saka.

The inscription appears to be fragmentary, but I see no reason whatever why it should be combined with No. A 43, as suggested by Barua-Sinha. *Sakā,* moreover, does not sound like a personal name , and the term *bhichhunī Sakā,* ‘the Buddhist nun’, occurs no-where, neither at Bhārhut nor in any other inscription.

***A 125 (899)[^(\[7\])](parta60.html#_f%0Atn7); PLATE XXV***

EDITED by Cunningham StBh. (1879), p. 143, No. 16, and Pl. LVI; Barua-Sinha BI. (1926), p. 37, No. 133.

TEXT:  
..yaya dānaṁ[^(\[8\])](parta60.html#_f%0Atn8)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_  
[^(\[1\])](parta60.html#_ftnref1)See classification I, 4, b, 4 (Śaivite names). Barua-Sinha think of *Śamidattā* besides *Svāmidattā.*  
[^(\[2\])](parta60.html#_ftnref2)See *ASIAR.* 1925-26, p. 148, Note 1, and Pl. LVIII d (above female figure).  
[^(\[3\])](parta60.html#_ftnref3)Barua-Sinha, BI. p. 100, no. 48 a, give an additional inscription *Soyāya dāna thabho,* which they translation as ‘the gift of Śreyā *(Śrēya)*─a pillar’. This inscription is probably the same as A 123 where they read *thabho* instead of *thabhā.* As no one else has noted this additional inscription it has not been treated by us separately.  
[^(\[4\])](parta60.html#_ftnref4)The second *akshara* is distinctly *bhā,* not *bho,* as given in Cunningham’s eye-copy. The vertical stroke at the bottom of *tha* appears to be accidental.  
[^(\[5\])](parta60.html#_ftnref5)See classification I, 2, A, b (names derived from, constellations).  
[^(\[6\])](parta60.html#_ftnref6)From Cunningham’s eye-copy which shows *thabhā,* whereas the transcript has *thabho.*  
[^(\[7\])](parta60.html#_ftnref7)Lüders’ treatment of this inscription is missing.  
[^(\[8\])](parta60.html#_ftnref8)From the eye-copy of Cunningham.
