Professor Hultzsch from the latter part of 1886 when he was appointed Epigraphist to the Government of Madras started a systematic collection of Inscriptions of Southern India. The Publication of these documents with texts and translations was taken up simultaneously and the following fascicule of South Indian Inscriptions were issued between the years 1886 and 1903. They included 321 records edited critically and supplied all the material that may be practically necessary for constructing the rough outlines of Chola and Pallava history.

On the North of Vindhyas side, in the year 1909, the late Shri. V. Venkayya, M.A. and Shri. Rai Bahadur, Epigraphist to the Government of India, volunteered their services to continue the work of Professor Hultzsch. In 1935, the Director of Archeology asked Shri. Vasudev Vishnu Mirashi, M.A., a former Principal and Professor of Sanskrit, Morris College at Nagpur, Vidarbha Mahavidyalaya at Amaravati, and before that Head of the Department of Sanskrit, Pali and Prakrit in the University of Nagpur to study the records of Kalachuri and Chedi dynasties. He handed over the transcript of his research in 1944 but because of World War II, the independence of India, and other circumstances, it was printed in 1954 in two parts. We are making available [*Part 1 of Kalachuri-Chedi inscriptions*](https://inscriptions.whatisindia.com/kalachuri-chedi/kalachuri-chedi-part1/index.html) and [*Part 2 of Kalachuri-Chedi Inscriptions*](https://inscriptions.whatisindia.com/kalachuri-chedi/kalachuri-chedi-part2/introduction.html).

In addition, we have also digitized the following books:

  Dynasty*](https://whatisindia.com/inscriptions/paramaras/paramaras-part2/index.html)  
- Inscriptions from the [*Silahara
  Dynasty*](https://whatisindia.com/inscriptions/silaharas/index.html)

  etc.*  
  ](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/corpusinscriptionumindicarum_/vol-iii/part-3/index.html)
- Inscriptions compiled by Sir Alexander Cunningham. This body of work
  assisted by Subhuti later spawned research by Andersen, Chavannes,
  Coomaraswamy, Foucher, Hultzsch, Minayeff, Oldenburg, Rhys Davids,
  Rouse, Waldschmidt, and Warren. These inscriptions were found in the
  book [*Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum Vol II Part
  II*](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/corpusinscriptionumindicarum_/vol-ii/part-2/index.html).  

A new set of books under Epigraphica India series and Annual Reports on Indian Epigraphy have also been digitzed. At present, we have:

- Epigraphica Indica [*Vol
  3*](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/epigraphica_indica/vol3/index.html)
- Annual Reports on Indian Epigraphy
  [*(1935-1938)*](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/annualreports/31stmarch1935/index.html)
- Annual Reports on Indian Epigraphy
  [*(1945-1952)*](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/annualreports/1945/index.html)

In these pages, we present these are inscriptions printed by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) on inscriptions from South India. This work has taken an enormous amount of energy, time, and money to digitize these texts and make them available to any individual interested in Indian history.

We hope that the availability of these inscriptions on the Internet will spur research into the history of India..
