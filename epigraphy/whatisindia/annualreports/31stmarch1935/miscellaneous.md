**[*Kōpperuñjiṅgadēva II*](contents4.html#_ftnref1100)**.  
75. The later Pallava chief **Kōpperuñjingadēva** II is represented by two inscriptions from Chidambaram in the South Arcot distrcit (Nos. 11 and 12) both dated in the 5th year of his regin. These contain the order of the officer **Sōlakōn** and mention as donors, Rāvaḷar Śrī-Kayilāsadēvar belonging to the Gōḷa\[ki\] *maṭha* at Tiruvaṇṇāmalai and Ponnambalakkūttan Tulaiyādaśelvan *alias* Kurukularāyan of Pālaiyūr *alias* Rājēndraśōlanallūr in Pālaiyūr-nāḍu, a subdivision of Ūrrukkāttu-kōttam. This Pālaiyūr is evidently identical with the present Pālūr in the Chingleput distrcit (No. 26 of 1932-33).

**[*Rājanārāyaṇas-Śambuvaraya.*](contents4.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 76. Two inscriptions of Sakalalōkachakravartin **Rajanarayaṇa-Sambuvaraya** were copied at Māraṅgiyūr (South Arcot distrcit). One of them (No. 82) dated in his 17th year gives details of date which correspond to May 20, A.D. 1353. It records a tax-free gift of 4 *mā* of land for worship and repairs to the temple and for a perpetual lamp by Māriṅgulān Tirumāgāḷamuḍaiyān Tiruviramīśvaramuḍaiyān Valittuṇai-Śivan. The record is signed at the end besides the donor, by Śāmbuvarāya himself. The latter’s signature seems to suggest that it should have formed part of documentary routine, since the land granted, was also made tax-free at the same time. The donor of the present record is mentioned again in No. 103 from the same place, wherein his two sons Tirumāgāḷamuḍaiyān and Sūryadēvar figure as donors of the *nandi-manḍapa* of the temple. The other record of Śambuvarāya (No. 91) is dated in his 19th year and it records a tax-free gift of land made by the chief for the conduct of worship and repairs and for a service called **Vīrachampan-śandi** in the temple of Tiruvirāmīśvara at Māriṅgūr *alias* Rājēndrasiṁhanallūr in Tirumunaippāḍi-nāḍu.

**[*Hoysaḷa Ballāḷa III.*](contents4.html#_ftnref1100)**  
  77. No. 106 from Viṇṇappaḷḷi in the Gobichettipalayam taluk of the Coimbatore district, is dated in the cyclic year Vishu in the reign of a **Vīra-Vallaḷadēva,** who has to be identified with the Hoysaḷa king Ballāḷa III. Vishu quoted in the present record would then correspond to A.D. 1341 which fell in his reign. The record registers a gift made by *Mahāpradhāna* Rāhuttarāya **Kēitaya-Daṇṇayaka** for providing worship to god Dēvanārāyaṇa-perumāḷ at Viṇṇappaḷḷi in Vaḍapariśāra-nāḍu. This Kēttaya-Daṇṇayaka was probably identical with Vīra-Chikka-Kētaya who figures in a record from
