**THE CHOLAS**

**[*Kulōttuṅga-Chōḷa II.*](cnt2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
38. From Peruveḷūr in the South Arcot district comes an inscription (No. 512) dated in the 13th year of **Kulōttunga-Chōḷa II** which records the founding of the temple of Tirukkōṭīśvaram-Uḍaiyār at the village and an endowment of 12 *vēli* of land for worship and offerings and for festivals therein and of another 12 *vēli* for the maintenance of ten *Bhaṭṭas* versed in the Vēdas and the Śāstras, one *Śaivāchārya* and one Vaidya who were all provided with house-sites on the north and west sides of the temple, by the chief Śeṅgēṇi-Nālāyiravan Ammaiyappan **Rājēndra-śōla-Śambuvarāyan,** a paḷḷi of Muññūr *alias* Rājanārāyaṇa-chaturvēdimaṅgalam in Ōymā-nāḍu. He also provided kinds for the Veḷḷāḷa tenants of these Bhaṭṭas and remitted the *pāḍikāval* taxes on the *dēvadāna* and the *agaram* lands. The donor is already known to us from other inscriptions as a subordinate of this king (No. 298 of 1929) as well as of his predecessor Vikrama-Chōḷa (No. 422 of 1922).

**[*Rajaraja II.*](cnt2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 39. Next in point of time is a record of **Rājarāja II** dated in his 8th year (No. 474) from Elavānāśūr in the South Arcot district, which states that the *tirukkalśārttu* and the *maṇḍapa* in front called the *Ēliśaimōgan-tirumaṇḍapam* in the tem- ple was the work of Kūḍalūr Āḷappirandān Ēliśaimōgan *alias* **Kulōttuṅgaśōla- Kāḍavarāyan** who is said to have had the proprietary right over Urumūr *alias* Śōlapāṇḍya-chaturvēdimaṅgalam, a *brahmadēya* in Mērkā-nāḍu, a subdivision of Virudarājabhayaṅkara-vaḷanāḍu. He is evidently the same as the donor of a *maṇḍapa* in the Vṛiddhāchalam temple, figuring in a record of the 15th year of Kulōttuṅga II (No. 137 if 1900). A chief of the name Kūḍalūr Āḷappairandān Mōgan *alias* Rājarāja-Kāḍavarāyan figures in an inscription of the 6th year of this king from the same place (No. 166 of 1906), and in another inscription (No. 170 of 1906) he bears the additional title *Nāludikkumvenrān.* All these names seem to refer to one and the same individual. Urumūr was the name by which Erumbūr in the Chidambaram taluk was known in ancient times and it was situated in Mērkā-nāḍu, a subdivision of Virudarājabhayaṅka ra-vaḷanāḍu (No. 387 of 1913). **No. 146** from Tiruchchendrai in the Trichinopoly district is dated in the **14th** year of Tribhuvanachakravartin Rājarājadēva and records both the royal order and the *uḷvari* granting 20 *vēli* of land tax-free at Īśānamaṅgalam *alias* Virudarājabhayaṅkara-chaturvēdimaṅgalam to the temple, under the name Rājagambhīra\[nallūr\]. *Rājagambhīra* as a probable surname of Rājarāja II is already known *(Ep. Rep.* for 1915, para. 26) and hence this inscription may have to be assigned to that king.

**[*Rajadhiraja II.*](cnt2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 40. There are four inscriptions of **Rājādhirāja II** ranging from the 5th year of his reign to the 13th. In one of these (No. 475) dated in his 13th year he is given the epithet *Īlamum Maduraiyum koṇḍa* (see No. 36 of 1906). In No. 364, dated in his 7th year the Malayamān chief of Kiḷiyūr *viz.,* Periya-uḍaiyān Nīrērrān alias Rājarāja-Malaiyakularāyan is said to have made a gift of the pāḍikāval and other taxes due from the *dēvadāna* village Parudal *alias* Malaiya- vichchādiranallūr to the temple of Ūrbāgaṅkoṇḍār at Elavānāśūr. This chief figures in No. 163 of 1906, dated in the 13th year of his predecessor Rājarāja II as making a representation to the king for the gift of a land to the same temple.

**[*Kulōṭṭuṅga-Chōḷa III.*](cnt2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 41. Of the records attributable to **Kulōttuṅga III,** No. 20 from Jambukē- śvaram is dated in the **7th year of Vīrarājēndradēva** and records an oath of allegiance taken by two persons, probably brothers, named Arayadēvan Mūvāyirattoruvan alias Vīrarājēndra-Brahmādarāya-Muttaraiyan and Arayadēvan Tiruveṇkāḍuḍaiyān alias Vikramaśōla-Brahmādarāya-Muttaraiyan to the chief Vīrrirundān Śēman Akaḷaṅka-Nāḍālvān, undertaking that they would strictly follow the latter’s orders in his rājakāryam (administration) as well as in vaniyam (war ?) without ever betraying him, that they would not collude with other parties mādarāyan borne by these chiefs they appear to have been Brahmans, wielding power in the region containing the temples of Tiruchchirāppaḷḷi-Uḍaiyār, TiruchchōrrutturaiUḍaiyār, Tirunāgēśvaram-Uḍaiyār, Tirukkāmakkōṭṭam--Uḍaiyār, and Tiruchchōrrutturaimurram-Uḍaiyār, by the gods of which the compact is sworn. Vīrrirundān Śēman of this record has figured in a record of the time of Rājādhirāja II at Vaḷappūr-nāḍu
