**THE KALINGA KINGS**

**[*Umavarman.*](cnt.html#_ftnref1100)**  
9. Two copper-plate grants were received during the year from Chicacole in the Vizagapatam district. One of them is an incomplete set (C. P. No. 22) which consists of two copper-plates strung together on a ring bearing a thick oval seal slightly tapering at the top and the bottom. On it is engraved a legend now worn out. It is stated to have been discovered by a cultivator of Dhavaḷapēṭa in the Chipurupalle taluk, who under the impression that the plates were of gold seems to have melted down the third plate. It is written in characters of about the 5th century A. D. and is dated in the reign of Mahārāja **Umavarman** (of Kaliṅga). The inscription has been published in the *Journal of the Andhra Historical Research Society* (Vol. X, p. 143) by Mr. Manda Narasimham who had obtained the plates on loan from the owner. It records a royal order issued from Sunagara conferring the village of Kuttupu in the district of Mahēndra-bhōga on a Brahman named Khallasvāmi of the Vasta-gōtra and the Chhandōga-śākhā and his descendants. Two grants of this king have been found so far and the present record adds one to the number *(Ep. Rep.* For 1935, Part II, para. 2).

 10. The other set (C. P. No. 12) consists of tree plates but with no ring and seal. It was in the possession of the Balaga Bāvāji-Mutt at Chicacole. The inscription on them is engraved in charac- ters of about the 7th century A. D. and an article on it has already appeared in the *Journal of Oriental Research* (Vol. XI., p. 55). It records an order issued by Sakala-Kaliṅgādhipati **Mahārāja Sāmantavarman** in Saṁvat 185, from Śvētakādhishṭhāna granting the village Phērava-grāma in Lōhaśriṅgāra-vishaya to Kīrttiśarman of the Bhāradvāja-gōtra and his three sons.

 The only other known record this king is the **Dhanantara** Plates published in *Epigraphia Indica* (Vol. XV, p. 275) where almost the same *praśasti* is employ- ed in describing the king, the only difference being in the use of the word *Śvētakādhirājyaḥ* in the Dhanantara Plates in place of the expression *Kaliṅgā- dhirājyaḥ* used in the present grant, to denote the country acquired by him by the strength of his arms. The *saṁvat* given here may be taken to refer to the Gaṅga era, in which case the date of the record would correspond to A. D. 678.
