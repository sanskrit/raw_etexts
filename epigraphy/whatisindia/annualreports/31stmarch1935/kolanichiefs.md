It records the interesting fact that he exempted the Brahmans, the ascetics and their wives, cattle, etc., from the road tax on the bank of the river (?) near Eṇḍapi and set up a Nandi pillar in front of the temple of Mahādēva at Yēṭikaru. The chief is indentical with the donor of the Chellūr plates dated in Śaka 1056 (mistake for Śaka 1065 ; See Ep. Ind., Vol. VII, App. No. 574) and belonging to the reign of Kulōttuṅga-Chōḍa II, son of Vikrama-Chōḷa (Ind. Ant., Vol. XIV, p. 56).

The other inscription (No. 244) belongs to **Kolani Kēśavamaṇḍalēśa**  
**[Kēśavamaṇḍalēśa in Śaka 1150](contents2.html#_ftnref1100).**  
and is dated in Śaka 1150, Vibhava. This chief is the same as Kēśavadēvarāja of No. 723 of 1920, dated in Śaka 1140, which is the latest date known so far for him, and the inscription under review extends his rule by at least 10 years.
