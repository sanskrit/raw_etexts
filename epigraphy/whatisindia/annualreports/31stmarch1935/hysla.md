**THE HOYSALAS**

**[*Vira-Somesvara.*](cn2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
36. There is only one inscription in the year’s collection belonging to the Hoysaḷa dynasty. It is No 193 engraved on a slab set up in a street at Tirup- paṅgili in the Trichinopoly district, and belongs to the time of Vīra-Sōmēśvara who is introduced with all his *birudas* such as *Ēkāṅgavīra, Śanivārasiddhi, Magadharājya-nirmūlana, Pāṇḍyadiśapaṭṭa and Chōḷarājyapratishṭhāchārya.* It relates to the erection of a *maṭha* apparently at the site where the slab is now planted by the king Pratāpachakravartin Pōśalar Vīra-Sōmēśvaradēva and his queen *(dēviyār)* whose name is not specified. A crudely cur figure of a tiger at the top portion of the slab evidently indicates the banner of the dynasty. The record does not bear the regnal year; and though the denomination of the *maṭha* is not mentioned, it may be presumed that it was a Śaiva *maṭha* founded by the king at Tiruppaṅgili. This *maṭha* has now disappeared completely and a stone-riveted well with a low kerb of rounded stones is all that remains of this institution. Two inscriptions (Nos. 133 and 147) from Śrīraṅgam which belong to the 29th and 32nd years of Rajarāja III mention king Sōmēśvara (No. 147) and (princess) Sōmalādēvī (No. 133), probably identical with the queen of Rājarāja III.
