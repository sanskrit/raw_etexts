Both of them refer to a deposit of a lakh of *varāhan* in the Government treasury by order of the Honourable Supreme Court, who appointed the Hindu Sabhā at Chennapaṭṇam to allocate the interest accruing therefrom for different charitable purposes. By this order the Raṅganātha temple was allotted 240 *varāhan* for feeding Brahman pilgrims in the temple, while the Jambukēśvara temple got 120 *varāhan for the ardhajāma*-service in the shrine of the goddess in the Śiva temple. Provision is made ta the end of the Śrīraṅgam inscription for the appointment of a teacher on 5 *varāhan* per month to teach English to the Hindu boys of the place.
