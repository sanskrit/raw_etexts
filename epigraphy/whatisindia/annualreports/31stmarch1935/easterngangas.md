****EASTERN GANGAS****

**[*Dēvēndravarman.*](contents2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
12. When I visited Tekkali in the early part of the year 1935, the Raja Sahib of the place was kind enough to place at my disposal a set of three copper- plates belonging to the **Eastern Ganga king Anantavarman** (No. 3 of App. A). The plates measure 4 3/8” by 2 7/8” with a ring-hole of about 7 ¼” in diameter at the left margin. Through this hole passes a ring about 2 ½” in diameter, the ekkali Plates of Anantavarman, son of ends of which are soldered into the bottom of a circular seal measuring about 7/8” in diameter. On the surface of the seal is cut in relief the figure of **a seated bull** facing the proper left. The first and third plates bear writing on one side only. while the second as usual bears it on both the sides. The set weighs 57 tolas. The figure of the bull is somewhat worn out. The ring securing the plates was already cut when the plates reached this office. The plates were returned to the owner after examination.

The document which is worded in a very corrupt style commences with the usual introduction of the Gaṇga grants, praising the city Kaliṅgangara’ and mentioning the glorious god Gōkarṇasvāmin established on the top of the Mahendra mountain. Then it proceeds to describe the qualities of king **Anantavarman,** son of Mahārāja **Dēvēndravarman** and records the gift by him of the village inicharaṇa, together with its tank to Vithubhata, son of Harichandra of the Kuṇḍilyagōtra. The date of the record is given in words as *Gāngeyavamsapravardhamana-vijayarāyya samvachhara trisatam athavanasāha* (358) and the occasion for the gift as ‘ *sūryagrahōparāgra*’ i.e. solar eclipse. The deed was composed by Matrisiri (sri) Samanta and engraved by the *akhasāli (akshasalin)* Nanaya.
