**THE HAIHAYAS**

**[*Kona-Manma-Malla*](cn.html#_ftnref1100)**  
7. This family of chiefs who ruled over portions of the Godavari district called Kōna-maṇḍala as subordinates to the Eastern Chāḷukyas, is represented by a copper-plate inscription (C. P. No. 4) of Kōna Manma-Malla, dated in Saka 1140, which secured from Kandikuppa In the Amalapuram taluk of the East Godavari district. It is important as being the only copper-plate grant of the family known 30 far. The genealogy of the chief is traced from Rājaparēṇḍu, ‘the hero of many battles’. In this genealogy, **Manma-Malla is said to have had an elder brother by name Bēta or Manma-Bēta** who is omitted in the table given in para.58 of the *Epigraphical Report* for 1932-33, wherein, however, his younger brother Sūrya is noticed, while he is omitted in the present grant. It records the endowment by the chief, of the village Kandikuppa separated from Pallamakurti in Guddeśa-Vishaya to the temple of Chōḍēśvara Mahādēva evidently in the same village for the merit of the donor’s father. This grant has been published in *Bhārati* for June 1938 (pp. 555 ff.).
