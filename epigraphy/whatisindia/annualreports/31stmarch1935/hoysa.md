**THE HOYSALAS**

47. The Hoysaḷa records in the year’s collection come mainly from Śrīraṅgam and Jambukēśvaram in the Trichinopoly district.

**[*Naraharibhūpāla (i.e.) Vīra-Narasiṁha.*](cont2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
No. 69 from Śrīraṅgam is dated in Śaka 1154, with other astronomical details giving the English equivalent A.D. 1232, April 6, Tuesday. It registers a gift of land for offerings to god Śrīraṅganātha by a certain Śrīrāma-Bhaṭṭa of the Bhārad- *vāja-gōtra,* who is described as the priest worshipping in the temple of Kṛishṇa (Kulalūdina-Piḷḷai), which had been built at Dōrasamudram by Umādēvī, the queen of Billāḷa (II). In a Sanskrit verse at the beginning of this inscription it is stated that this Śrīrāma-Bhaṭṭa, son of a great teacher of Kuruhapura, was proficient in mantric lore and that he was an ardent Vaishṇava. He is said to have lived in the time of king Narahari-bhūpāla *i.e.* **Narasimha,** who bears the title ‘ Chōḷēndra-pratishṭhāguru’, and this has reference to the help rendered by him to king Rājarāja III earlier in his reign against the Pāṇḍya king and the Pallava Peruñjiṅgadēva I. In the fifth *prākāra* of the Śrīraṅgam temple itself there is a highly ornate shrine of Vēṇugōpāla-Kṛishṇa, with sculptures and figurines resembling Hoysaḷa work but with no inscriptions on its walls. It is possible that this shrine came into existence during the period of the Hoysaḷa occupation of Śrīraṅgam and its environs.

**[*Vira-Somesvara.*](cont2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 48. The several records belonging to Vīra-Sōmēśvara copied in this as well as in the previous years come mostly from Jambukēśvaram. We know that Vīra- Sōmēśvara settled himself in the south with his capital at Kaṇṇanūr-koppam, five miles to the north of Śrīraṅgam. As he was an ardent Śaivite, the Jambukēśvaram temple was the recipient of his royal patronage, as testified to by his numerous epigraphs found engraved on its walls, which mention also the names of several shrines which were erected in this period. The beautiful seven-storyed *gōpura* on the east side was completed by him, as indicated in No. 19 of 1891. As the Pāṇḍya emblem of two carps flanking an *aṅkuśa* is found sculptured in relief on the inner face of its two main ceiling beams, it is evident that the constructed of this gōpura was begun by a Pāṇḍya king, probably Māravarman Sundara-Pāṇḍya I of A.D. 1216, and that it was completed by the Hoysaḷa king. Sōmēśvara’s records are not found at Śrīraṅgam, the famous Vaishṇava centre, close to
