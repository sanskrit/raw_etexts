**THE PANDYAS**

the second *prākāra* of the temple. No. 171 form the same temple wherein the king’s name is given merely as Tribhuvanachakravartin Kōnērinmaikoṇḍān is to be assigned to this Sundara-Pāṇḍya to judge from the provision made in it for conducting the service called ‘ Kōdaṇḍarāghavan-śandi’ in the temple (Ep. Rep. for 1936-37, para. 43). Another inscription (No. 174) from the same place belonging to Jaṭāvarman Tribhuvanachakravartin Sundara-Pāṇḍya is dated in the 4th year. The astronomical details given in it work out for the reigns of 3 Pāṇḍya sovereigns with accession dates A. D. 1251, 1276 and 1318. This inscription is signed by Periyanāṭṭu-vēḷān who also figures as signatory with his official designation *Nāṭṭukkaṇakku* in No. 191, dated in the 10th year of Jaṭāvarman Sundara-Pāṇḍya I corresponding to A. D. 1261. Since before this year Jaṭāvarman Sundara-Pāṇḍya I had not occupied Śrīraṅgam (Ep. Rep. for 1936-37, para. 39) and the adjoining area, the present record, dated as it is in the 4th year cannot be assigned to him. Hence it has to be referred either to Jaṭāvarman Sundara-Pāṇḍya II (accn. .A .D. 1276) or to Jaṭāvarman Sundara-Pāṇḍya IV (accn. A. D. 1318), and more probably to the former, judging from the signatory figuring in it. No. 326 form Nāmakkal is to be assigned to Jaṭāvarman Sundara-Pāṇḍya IV (accn. A. D. 1318) from the astronomical details given in it.

32. From Śrīvāñjiyam in the Tanjore distrcit come 5 records of Jaṭāvarman Vīra-Pāṇḍya ranging in date from his 13th (No. 231) to 23rd regnal year (No. 232). These record sales of land to the temple of Tiruvāñjiyam-Uḍaiyār by Alagiyanāyan Tiruvambalapperumāḷ, the headman of Śirupanrūr (Nos. 230, 231 and 232), and Alagiyatiruchchirrambalam-Uḍaiyān Gāṅgēyan of Tīraṅguḍi (No. 233) No. 149 from Śrīraṅgam, dated in the 21st year of Tribhuvanachakravartin Kōnērinmaikoṇḍan is probably to be assigned to this VīraPāṇḍya. It records the confirmation by the king of a tax-free grant of the village Chittiravalli alias Kēraḷa-chaturvēdimaṅgalam in Kōṭṭaikkarai-nāḍu made by Ayyan (father) Kulaśēkhara for the expenses of a service called ‘ Kulaśēkharan-śandi’ instituted in his own name in the temple. The original grant owing to some unknown reason had probably fallen into desuetude which necessitated its revival by the son. This son could not be Sundara-Pāṇḍya (accn. A. D. 1303) as his latest date is not known to have extended up to the 21st regnal year as given in the present record. Hence this may only refer to Sundara-Pāṇḍya’s half-brother Vīra-Pāṇḍya. At Śrīvāñjiyam has been copied an inscription (No. 226) of Māravarman Vīra-Pāṇḍya, dated in some year (2) opposite his 22nd, which records a sale of land to the temple by a certain Maṅgalaṅkilaiyān Dēvargandan. As the inscription is damaged, the details of date cannot be correctly worked out, but it might be noted that the only Māra- varman Vīra-Pāṇḍya with this high regnal year was the one with accession date A. D. 1334, and hence it is very probably this Vīra-Pāṇḍya who is meant in the inscription.

**[*Māṛavarman Kulaśēkhara accn. A. D. 1314.*](cn2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 33. Two records secured from Śrīraṅgam (Nos. 115 and 116) are both dated in the 5th year of Kulaśēkhara. They purport to be an order issued by the God himself assigning to the *48 Bhaṭṭas* of Kōdaṇḍarāma-chaturvēdimaṅgalam round the Veḷḷaimurram-maṇḍapa near the *Ellaikarai* founded by Karumāṇikkālvān of Pāṇḍi-maṇḍalam, the offered food of the God from the two services Pon-*mēyndān-śandi and Kōdaṇḍarāman-śandi.* The second inscription which is closely connected with the first clearly states that this *agrahāra* was formed for the welfare of Perumāḷ Sundara-Pāṇḍya, and also makes reference to the two services in the temple, one as a recent institution and the other as an earlier one, ‘ Ponmēyndān ’ is well known as a title of Jaṭāvarman Sundara-Pāṇḍya of accession A. D. 1251 and ‘Kōdaṇḍarāman’ as that of a later Sundara-Pāṇḍya of accession A. D. 1303. The Kulaśēkhara of these two records must therefore be identical with Māravarman Kulaśēkhara of A. D. 1314.

**[*Parākrama-Pāṇḍya accn. A. D. 1334.*](cn2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 34. A single record of Parākrama-Pāṇḍya bearing no distinguishing epithet was secured from Śrīvāñjiyam in the Tanjore district (No. 225). It registers a gift of land by Aluginaipperumāḷ of Piraiyūr in Naḍuvil-maṇḍalam to the goddess Vēyantōḷiyār consecrated by him as a consort to Dundumīśvaramuḍaiya-Nāyanār in the temple of Tiruvāñjiyamuḍaiya-Nāyanār. From the writing of the record, the inscription may be assigned to the 14th century A. D., and
