**THE CHOLAS**

of Kāmadēvar , who is stated to have a son *(piḷḷai)* of **Tīkkānai-Nāchchiyār, one of the queens of Vīra-Sōmēśvaradeva.**

**[*Management of the kingâ€™s personal lands.*](cn2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 Another record which is from Tiruveḷḷarai (No. 204) and is dated in the 20th year of the king is of some interest as it registers a decision of the *Mūla- Parishat* of the place which was convened in the *tirumurram* of Vāsudēva-viṇṇagar-Emberumān of Narasiṅgamaṅgalam, a hamlet of Tiruveḷḷarai with regard to the lease of some villages belonging to the king. According to the decision, the existing committee of probably four members was replaced by another consisting of eight, who should settle the *kaḍamai and kuḍimai* dues to be collected on lands therein. The members of this committee were remunerated for their service and were to be changed annually. It was further ruled that a person who once served on this committee should not be selected again for the next four years.

**[*Horse dealer of Malai-maṇḍalam.*](cn2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 No. 186 form Tiruppaṅgili, dated in the 3\[2\]nd year of Rājarāja III refers to the *Āśraya-liṅga* called Tiruttālīśvaram-uḍaiya-Nāyanār set up in the temple by Pugalan Tiruttālaiyan, a horse dealer of Kuḷamukku in Malai-maṇḍalam. Another horse dealer named Koṇḍanambi hailing from the same place figures in No. 77 of 1936-37 form Śrīraṅgam as donor to the Raṅganātha temple. Malai- maṇḍalam occurs frequently in inscriptions in connection with horse-dealers and hence it would appear as if they had their guild in Malai-maṇḍalam (Travancore) where they imported horses and distributed them according to demand to different places of South India.

**[*Rājēndra-Chōḷa III.*](cn2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 25. The merchant Tiruttālaiyan (or Tiruttāla-Maṇavāḷan) mentioned above figures again in a record of the 4th year of Rājēndra-Chōḷa III (No. 185) as donor of money for worship and offerings to the deity set up by him in the temple at Tiruppaṅgili. There are two other inscriptions of Rājēndra-Chōḷa in the collection, of which No. 148, dated in the 4th year, records a gift of money for providing garlands daily to god Raṅganātha for the merit of Iḷaiyaperumāḷ, son of Śiruśiṅgāṇḍi of Ālvārkaṇmaṭṭam and of Tiruppārkaḍar-dāsar, a Vaishnava of Śrīraṅgam *(Tiruppati-Śrīvaishṇava),* while the other (No. 169), dated in the 7thh year registers a gift of land to the temple at Tiruppaṅgili by a certain Karuṅkōyan Chēraśiṅgadēvan of Maṅgalam in Pūndurai-nāḍu.
