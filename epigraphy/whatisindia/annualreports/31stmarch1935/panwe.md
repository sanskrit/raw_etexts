**THE PANDYAS**

**[*Jaṭāvarman Śrīvallabha.*](cn2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
26. The Pāṇḍya records of the year come from the Tanjore and Trichinopoly districts and a few from Alagarkōyil near Madura. Among the latter is a fragmentary inscription (No. 218) engraved on a broken pillar now lying in the 3rd prākāra of the Saundararāja-Perumāḷ temple of the place. It commences with the introduction *Tirumaḍandaiyum,* etc., and belongs to the 5th year of Jaṭāvarman alias Uḍaiyār Śrīvallabhadēva (acc. A.D. 1132). It seems to record an endowment for offerings to god Tirumāliruñjōlai-Ālvār at Kīl-Iraṇiyamuṭṭam. This is the only known inscription of this king at Alagarkōyil, the other secured in 1929-30 (A. R. No. 313 of 1929-30), dated in the 2nd year of Tirubhuvana- chakravartin Kōnērinmaikoṇḍān Śrīvallabha being assignable to the later king of the name (accn. A.D. 1291), on account of the mention in it of the Sundarapāṇḍya-maṇḍapa which is known to have been constructed by Jaṭāvarman Sundara-Pāṇḍya I (accn. A.D. 1251 ; A.R. No. 84 of 1928-29).

**[*Māṛavarman Sundara-Pāṇḍya I.*](cn2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 27. Of the inscriptions of Māravarman Sundara-Pāṇḍya I, No. 196 from Tiruveḷḷarai which can be assigned to him is important. It is in verse and states that the Pāṇḍya king who threatened to trample his unyielding enemies under the feet of his elephants, **partitioned the Kāvēri-nāḍu between the Vaḷavan (i.e, Chōḷa) and the Māgadar-kōn.** It is known from the titles *Śōṇāḍu- koṇḍaruḷiya, Śōṇāḍu-Valaṅgiyaruḷiya* and from the specific lesson of the restitution of the crown and Muḍikoṇḍaśōlapuram to Kulōttuṅga-Chōḷa III (No. 9 of 1926) and his anointment at Āyirattaḷi (No. 47 of 1937-38), that Sundara-Pāṇḍya did not annex the conquered Chōḷa territory to his dominions. That the whole of this territory was not restored to the Chōḷa king list a portion of it was sliced away and given to the Māgada chief, perhaps for assistance
