**THE KAKATIYAS**

while Viradhāvaḷa is not easily identifiable It was known to the Muhammadan historians as Bĩr Dhōl and from the way in which they refer to the place, it appears to have been a coastal town. It has been identified with Marakkāṇam in the South Arcot district *( J. A. H. R. S. Vol. XIII,pp.1 ff.),* but an inscription from Alagarkōyil, dated in the 35th year of Māravarman Kulaśēkhara who was Pleased to take every country’ definitely locates this place in Uraiyūr kūrram, a subdivision of Tenkarai Rājagambhīra-vaḷanāḍu. (No. 319 of 1929-30) and the place may therefore have to be looked for in the vicinity of Uraiyūr itself.

**[*Kayastha chiefs.*](cn.html#_ftnref1100)**  
9. The Kāyastha subordinate of the Kākatīya kings **Gaṇḍapeṇḍāra Jannigadēva-Mahārāja,** is represented by an inscription from the Cuddapah district, dated in the cyclic year Siddhā rthin corresponding to Śaka 1181 (N.o.347). He is stated to have made a gift of the village Turumiḍlapāḍu for the worship of the god Indrēśvara at Chintalapaṭṭūru. Another chief of this family was **Tripurāridēva,** brother of Jannigadēva, whose inscription copied this year at Lēbāka (No. 391) in the Cuddapah district is dated in Śaka 1226. He is said to have been ruling from Vallūripaṭṭana situated in Mulki-nāḍu and bore the usual *birudas* of the family *viz. Maṇḍalika-Brahmarākshasa and Gaṇḍapeṇḍāra*. Though there is no mention of his Kākatīya overlord who must be Pratāparudra at this time, it need not be supposed that this chief set up an independent Prin cipality with valūr (Vallūr in the Cuddapah taluk) as his capital. The date given in the present inscription is the latest year Known so far for him.

**[*Prōlaya-Nāyaka.*](cn.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 10. A copper-plate grant (C. P. No. 5) of Prōlaya-Nāyaka, the cousin and predecessor of Kāpay-Nāyaka who built up a principality on the ruins of the Kākatīya kingdom after its fall at the hands of the Muhammadans, was secured for examination from MR. M. S. Sarma of the *Bhārati* office. It gives an interesting account of **the capture and imprisonment at Delhi of the Kākatiya king Pratāparudra,** the misrule of the Mussalamans of that period and the attempts made by Prōlaya to re-establish Hindu rule. It states that while Pratāparudra was ruling his kingdom Triliṅga from his capital Ēkaśilā, the great lord of the Turushkas, Ahammadu Suratrāṇa entertained great enemity towards him and in the encounter that ensued, Vīra-Rudra (Pratāparudra) vanquished him as many as seven times, but was ultimately taken captive and while being taken to Delhi he died on the way on the banks of the river Sōmōdbhavā (Narmadā). Then darkness overshadowed the earth (i.e., Triliṅga), People were dispossessed of their wealth images were broken, brahmans forsook their avocations and many were killed, agraharas were forfeited and the ploughmen were ruined by the wicked Yavanas. No one could call anything his own in this great calamity and life became intolerable. Then appeared, as if by avatāra a king named Prōla of the Śūdra caste, born of the Mussinūri family. He overthrew the Yavanas to whom his name became a terror. Under him the very people who were oppressed formerly now turned against their oppressors, the Turushkas and routed their armies and the old order of things was restored in every way. this Prōla established his capital at **Rēkapalle** on the banks of the Gōdāvarī, which excelled Amarāvatī (evidently the Puranic residence of Indra ) in splendour with its rich emporium beaming with costly gems, pearls and other precious articles. Prōla, in course of time, entrusted the administration of the kingdom to **his cousin Kāpaya-Nāyaka** and devoted himself to the performance of Dharma, The record then states that Prōla, after enquiring about the most deserving persons, granted the village Vilasā on the banks of the Gōdāvari in Kōnāvanimaṇḍala to the scholar Vennayaśarman of the Bhāradvāja-gōtra Who in turn, along with his brother Gaṇapaya. settled it as an agrahāra among 108 Brahmans well versed in the *Vēdas* and *Sastras.*

**[*Uṇḍiśvaradēva of the solar race.*](cn.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 11. From the Collector of East Godavari was received a set of copper-plates, dated in Śaka 1299 (C. P. No. 13). It is said to have been issued by the chief Uṇḍiśvaradēva belonging to the solar race and the Hārita-gōtra. Another copper plate grant the same chief under the name Uṇḍirāja, dated 5 years later, i.e., in Śaka 1304 has been reviewed in *Ep. Report* for 1918, para.82. The ancestry of the chief is given in the present record for 6 generations and starts from Rājarāja whose son was Uṇḍīśvaradēva (I), while that in the other begins with the latter’s son Dēvarāja. It mentions the grant, made on previous
