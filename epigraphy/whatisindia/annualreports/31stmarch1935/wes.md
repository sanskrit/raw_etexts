**THE WESTERN CHALUKYAS**

**[*Vikramaditya IIÂ¬-his subordinate Pormukharama.*](cnt.html#_ftnref1100)**  
15. A record belonging to the Chāḷukya dynasty of Bādāmi is No. 284 from Tippalūru in the Kamalapuram taluk of the Cuddapah district, which is dated in the very **first regnal year** of **Vikramāditya** **Satyāśraya.** It registers the gift of the *pannāsa* income of the village Marralūru by Vāmbuḷu who is described as a ‘tiger of his brother’ *(aṇṇārāpuli),* to the Īśvara temple at Vēṅgipāra. At the time of th record, it is stated that **Pōrmukharāma** was in charge of the Bāṇa territory bounded by the Pennā river *(Pennā-mariyāda).* Palæographically this record can be attributed to the 8th century A. D. and the Chāḷukya king was presumably Vikramāditya II (A. D. 733-46). Pōrmukharāma may perhaps be identified in Puṇyakumāra alias Pōrmukharāma of the Mālēpāḍu plates, who is mentioned in several stone inscriptions of this locality attributable to the 8th century A. D. A this record is dated in the very first regnal year of Vikramāditya Satyāśaya, it may be placed in A. D. 733-34, when Puṇyakumāra was a feudatory of the Chāḷukyan throne.\*

\* A certain Vikramāditya belonging to the family is known from a record at Chilamkūru, to have been ruling over the Bāṇa territory (No. 403 of 1904), evidently as a Western Chāḷukya subordinate as his name would suggest
