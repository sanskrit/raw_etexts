This chief was a faithful vassal of Tirumala-Nāyaka of Madura and received the title ‘ Tirumalai-Sētupati’ from his master (Satyanatha Aiyer’s *History of the Nayakas of Madura,* p. 136). He is said to have belonged to the family of Jētuṅgarājan and of have been residing in his palace *Viraiyādakaṇdn* to the east of Kāṭṭūr alias Kulōttuṅgaśōlanallūr in Tugavūr-kūrram. The present inscription registers the grant of a village to the god at Rāmēśvaram by Madavuḍaichchi alias Kūrichchāttan-Śēruvaikāran, son of Chidambaran- Śēruvaikāran residing at Koḷundurai (modern Koḍundurai in the Mudukulattur taluk, Ramnad distrcit). The Postal Directory calls this Kolundurai.

**[The Madura Nayakas.](contents4.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 84. An inscription from Tiruchchuli in the Ramnad district (No. 192) which is dated in Śaka 1630 records gift of a village for the requirements of the temple of Tirumēnināthasvāmin at the place by a certain Era Veṅkaṭapati- Nāyaka, son of Ramaṇappa-Nāyaka for the merit of **Vijayamuttu-Chokkanātha- Nāyaka.** son of Raṅgakṛishṇamuttu Vīrappa-Nāyaka of the Kāśyapagōtra. Vijayamuttu (Vijayaraṅga) Chokkanātha was the last ruler of the Madura Nāyaka dynasty after whose death in 1732 A.D., his wife Mīnākshī assumed the government of his territory and struggled on for a few years before Madura finally passed into the hands of the Muhammadans. The donor of the grant is possibly identical with Mīnākshi’s brother Veṅkaṭaperumāḷ-Nāyaka with whose support she was carrying on the administration of her country.
