****SAILODBHAVAS****

name Pētavyāllaparāja in line 19 must be corrected into paitṛivy=ōllavarāja thus giving the name of the king as Allavarāja, (his) uncle’s son (vide also Ep. Ind., Vol. XXI, p. 25, fn. 2). This mistake has led Dr. Śastri to introduce Pētavyāllapa as the second son Madhyamarāja. It is necessary here to caution readers against adopting the genealogies suggested by Mr. Ś. Rajaguru (J.B.O.R.S., Vol. XVI, p. 176, ff) and Mr.Vinayaka Misra (Ind Hist. Quarterly, Vol. VII, p. 665 ff) which are based upon very precarious readings.
