**[*Sadasivadeva-Maharaya.*](contents4.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 69. Sadāśiva is represented by 16 inscriptions, nearly all of the which come form the Kurnool and Cuddapah districts. They give the names of several chiefs who served the king in this region, viz. :â€”

1\. Mahāmaṇḍalēśvara Rāmarāja Tirumalarājayyadēva-Mahārāja (No. 276), who is also referred to in an inscription at Alagarkōyil (Madura) in the distant south (No. 93 of 1929, dated in Śaka 1465).  
  
2. Mahāmaṇḍalēśvara Nandēla Chinna-Avubaḷayyadēva-Mahārāja, son of Naraśiṅgarāja and grandson of Nandēla Śiṅgarāja of the Lunar race and the Ātrēya-gōtra, who held Śiruvoḷḷa-sīma as a *nāyaṅkara* form the king (No. 267).  
  
3. Mahāmaṇḍalēśvara Nandēla Timmarāja, who held Ghaṇḍikōṭa as *amara-māgāṇi.* His subordinates were Mallappa, son of \[Andugula\] Parvatarāja and Timmayya and Sūrayya, sons of Timmarāja of Tippalūr (No. 333).

He is mentioned in an inscription at Narasṅgapuram in the Chingleput district dated in Śaka 1467 (No. 250 of 1910).  
  
6. Mahāmaṇḍalēśvara Koṇḍarājayyadēva-Mahārāja, son of Rāmarāja- Veṅkaṭēśa who held the Gondalūru-sīma as a *nāyaṅkara* form the king (No. 270),  
  
7. Mahāmaṇḍalēśvara Kṛishṇamarājayyadēva-Mahārāja, son of Mūrttirājayyadēva-Mahārāja and the grandson of Āravīṭi Bukkarāja Rāmarājayyadēva-Mahārāja, who held the Śiruvōḷa-sīma as a nāyaṅkara form Mahāmaṇḍalēśvara Rāmarāja Veṅkaṭādrirājayyadēva-Mahārāja (No. 258).  
  
8. Timmarāja, son of Mahāmaṇḍalēśvara Pina Śrīraṅgarāja, who held Tēkaṇṭikōṭa-sīma as an *amara-nāyaka* (No. 289).

10. Nandyēla Timmarājayya Nāraparājayya for whose merit a gift was made to the local temple by three persons (No. 333).  
  
11. Nalan-Kṛishṇama-Nāyaka, son of Vayyappa-Nāyaka of the Kavarai-nāyaka community was in the South Arcot district. His uncle was Akkappa-Nāyaka, whose son, Koṇḍama-Nāyaka figures as donor to the temples at Ādichchanallūr (No. 240 of 1934-35) and Vīrapāṇḍyanallūr in the South Arcot district (No. 60).

**[*Remission of taxes on the barbers and the Dommaris.*](contents4.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 70. A number of inscriptions of Sadāśiva have been copied in previous years which record the remission of taxes on the barbers throughout the dominion. His general order to remit the taxes on this community was given effect to by local chiefs within their jurisdiction. Four records in the present collection register this concession shown to the barbers at Maddikēra (No. 292), Gondalūru-sīma (No. 270), Avuku-sīma (No. 276) and Kolavali in the Nandyāla province (No. 317). Along with the barbers, the *Dommaris* (acrobats) were also exempted from certain taxes (No. 270). They consisted of 64 families and lived a corporate life as may be judged from an endowment made to the temple at Urutūru for the merit of the whole community (No. 329). Some of the taxes remitted on these two classes were *pannu, kāṇika, Dommari-pannu, veṭṭi-vēmulu, kāpura-pannu and siddhaya*
