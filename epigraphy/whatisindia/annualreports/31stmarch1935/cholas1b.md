No. 139 secured from Tirukkoḷḷikkāḍu in the Tanjore district gives us some interesting information regarding land dispute. Unfortunately it is not complete, portions of it having been lost. We learn from the record that the sabhā of Mā\[rā\]yamaṅgalam had been in the enjoyment of two pieces of land belonging to the temple for a period of 35 years in the interval between the 3rd year of Uttama-Chōladēva and the 29th year of Rājēndra-Chōḷa I, and that on the petition of one Annadānayōgi of Tiruvaṇḍurai made to the king, the officer Rājēndrachōḷa-Mūvēndavēlar was deputed to enquire into the matter and to resume the land for the temple of Tirukkoḷḷikkāḍuḍaiya-Mahādēva. The officer accordingly summoned the assembly, and having found after enquiry that they had actually been in the enjoyment of the lands (evidently without any authority), imposed upon them a penalty by which they were required to pay 400 *kāśu* instead of 200 *kāśu* received by them previously, evidently as tax-money. As the assembly could not pay this amount to the temple, they returned these two pieces of land to it for a value of 100 *kāśu* and for the balance of 300 *kāsu* agreed to pay (to the State) in perpetuity all the taxes due on the lands.

38. Rājamahēndra, the son of Rājēndradēva and the nephew of Vīra-Rājēndra is represented in the collected by a single inscription (No. 80) dated in his 4th year. Details of date are given which correspond to A.D. 1062, July 22, Monday. This is the **latest** **date** known so far him from his inscriptions. It states that the assembly of Nelvāyppākkam alias Rājēndraśiṅga-chaturvēdimaṅgalam, a *bramadēya* in Kūḍal-Ilāraippāḍi, a subdivision of Rājēndraśōla-vaḷanāḍu, which was evidently adjacent to Māraṅgiyūr where the inscription was found, endowed some land as dēvadāna to the god for the sacred bath, for the maintenance of a light and for offerings during one service in the day, in expiation of the obstruction and harm done to the image of the deity while on a procession within their boundary.

**[Kulōttuṅga-Chōḷa I.](contents3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
39. There are six inscriptions of Kulōttuṅga I ranging between the 30th and 47th years of his reign. Three of these (Nos. 140, 135 and 130) from Tirukkoḷḷikkāḍu in the Tanjore district start with rather a curious beginning by stating that for want of space (on the walls) the king’s panegyrical introduction has been omitted. A few other inscriptions from the same place belonging to his successors also begin with the same remark (e.g. No. 131 belonging to Kulōttuṅga II and No. 134 of Rājādhirāja II). This is analogous to the phrase *Śrīmeykkīrttikkumēl* occurring in other inscriptions, where the historical introduction has been omitted on account of its being too well-known at the time to need a recapitulation in the each and every inscription of a particular king.

**[Vikrama-Chōḷa.](contents3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
40. An inscription form Māraṅgiyūr (South Arcot) (No. 90) dated in the 15th year of Vikrama-Chōḷa records a sale of land by the *Ūrār* of the place to a certain Kūḍal Kamban Vikramaśōla-Vāṇakularāyan who endowed it to the temple. Māriṅgūr alias Kūḍal-Ilāḍaippāḍi is said to be situated in Rājarājavaḷanāḍu. In the Ep. Rep. for 1934-35, it was surmised that as the name of the *vaḷanādu* in which Arakaṇḍanallūr was situated is given as Rājarājavaḷanāḍu in an inscription of Kulōttuṅga II, whereas in the records of Vikrama-Chōḷa it was known as Rājēndra-vaḷanāḍu, the change should have been made after Rājarāja II who possibly came to be associated with the administration of the kingdom from the 9th year of his father’s reign. But the mention of Rājarāja-vaḷanāḍu even in the reign of Vikrama-Chōḷa, as stated above, stands in the way of that supposition, but it does not help us to explain how or when the name was changed. The surname of the donor of the present record suggests that he was a person of some importance and possibly a feudatory chief under the king-belonging to the Bāṇa family.

**[Kulōttuṅga-Chōḷa II.](contents3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
41. An inscription of Kulōttuṅga-Chōḷadēva (No. 79) dated in his 2nd regnal year gives him the title *Sarvabhuvanāsraya.* This cannot refer to Kulōttuṅga I who was known as Rājēndra-Chōḷa during the early years of his
