****TELUGU CHODAS****

**Gaṇgaya-Dēvachōḷa-mahāraja.**  
and whose head is stated to have been cut off might possibly be identical with Bhīma Dēvachōḍamahārāja of Kandūru mentioned above (No. 224). The cavalier Gaṅgayasāhiṇi whose treasures (*sarvasva*) were seized by Gaṅgayadēva must be the same as Gaṇgayasāhiṇi who was a General under Kākatīya Gaṇapati in Śaka 1176 (No. 231 of 1905). If these identifications are correct, we will have to suppose that Gaṅgaya-Dēvachōḷamahārāja achieved these exploits quite early in his youth and that he was pretty old at the time of the present inscription i.e. Śaka 1244. Allugaṅgarāja, the father of Gaṅgayadēva may be the same chief whom Ambadēva of the Kāyastha family is stated to have defeated *(Ep. Rep.* for 1906, Part II, para 44).
