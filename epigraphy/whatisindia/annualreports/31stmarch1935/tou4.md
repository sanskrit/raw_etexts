September 1937 to 27th December 1937. This completes the survey of the entire Bijapur district begun some years ago. The present collection of 87 inscriptions represents mainly the records of the Rāshṭrakūṭa, Western Chā- ḷukya, Kaḷachurya and Yādava dynasties.

 13. During the year under review 191 villages in all were visited, of which 101 villages yielded 531 inscriptions belonging to various dynasties. In the Bombay-Karnatak, 123 villages were visited, from 36 of which 87 inscriptions were secured. 27 copper-plate grants were examined. 192 photographs were taken of objects of interest. A lot containing 466 copper-coins of the 17th and 18th centuries A. D. discovered at Karur was also examined.

 Corrected second proof of the *Annual Report* for 1933-34 was sent to press on 10th May 1937 and the *Report* was finally issued about 24th December 1937. The first proof of the *Report* for 1934-35, of which the typescript had been sent to the Government of India Press on 19th February 1937, was re- ceived in October 1937 and its corrected final proof was submitted to the Director General of Archæology on 4th April 1938 for his approvals and strike order. The typescript of the *Report* for 193-36 was submitted for the appro- val of the Director General of Archæology on 11th September 1937 and was sent to the Government Press, Madras, on 6th January 1938.

 14. Of the volume of *Bombay Karnatak Inscriptions* proofs of 134 pages were received from the press during the year in batches.
