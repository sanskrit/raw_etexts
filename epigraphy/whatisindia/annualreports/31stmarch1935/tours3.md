**TOURS OF THE SUPERINTENDENT AND THE ESTABLISHMENT DURING THE YEAR 1936-37.**

the places visited by him attention may be drawn to Kaḍalevāḍ on the banks of the Bhīmarathī with its dilapidated temple having, however, a fine *raṅga- maṇḍapa* with very artistic carvings and figures in its dome-like ceiling inside. This place was a great centre of religious and educational activities in ancient days and a Kaḷachurya inscription found here describes the village as a *Ghaṭikāsthāna.* Kaḍalēvāḍa-Kalkēri was another important place in ancient times having several mercantile guilds which maintained an educational institution with provision for the teaching of *Nyāsa, Prabhākara, Rigvēda, Purāṇa and Vēdānta.* Near the outer wall of the Śiva temple here which, from its style may be assigned to the 13th century A.D., is a beautiful sculpture in stone of a tiger attacking an elephant and itself being pierced by a man holding a dagger in one hand and a shield in the other.

  
 Inscriptions at Kulekomaṭgi and Malghāna belonging to the later Chāḷu- kyan period record gift to shrines dedicated to Āditya. Another place deserving of mention is Chaṭṭarki with its temple of Dattātrēya. The principle deity which is still under worship is a beautiful figure with only one face and 6 arms, two of which are holding the Vaishṇava attributes of śaṅkha and chakra, while two others have the Śaiva emblems, viz., ḍamaru and triśūla. At Koṇḍaguḷi is a Hanumān temple with a fine sculpture of an emaciated female figure probably Chaṇḍikā, profusely decorated with ornaments and represented with hanging breasts and two arms and a garland of skulls and standing in a fighting pose.
