**MISCELLANEOUS**

**[*Two Jaina temples at Chittamur.*](cnt3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 79. The Jainas in the Tamil country are mainly confined to the North Arcot, South Arcot and Chingleput districts, and the pontiff who looks after their spiritual needs has his headquarters at **Chittāmūr** in the Gingee taluk of the South Arcot district. His *maṭha* claims connection with the parent institution at Śravaṇa-Beḷgoḷa in the Mysore State. There are two temples at Chittāmūr. one of which is called the Malainātha temple and consists of a boulder of rock on which an oblong panel of the *Tirthaṅkara* Bāhubalin, Pārśvanātha, Nēminātha and Mahāvīra flanked by *Yakshis* is elegantly sculptured in half relief. A modern *maṇḍapa* added in front provides shelter for the alter and the worshippers. This must have been the original Jaina temple of importance at this place, which is referred to as Kāṭṭāmbaḷḷi or Tiruvūrāmbaḷḷi in two records of the time of Rājakēsarivarman (17th year) and Rājādhirāja (10th year) engraved on two stray slabs (Nos. 201 and 202 of 1902) at that village, which are now lost. The other, more modern, temple of Pārśvanātha is the official temple in the charge of the *Maṭhādhipati* of this place, and it has now grown in importance to the subordination of the older monument. The earliest inscriptions in this temple are two records dated in Śaka 1500, engraved on the base of the *Mānastambha* in front, which refer to the erection of the column by a merchant of Jagatāpi-Gutti named **Buśśeṭṭi,** also called Būśrēshṭi, son of Bāyi-Śeṭṭi (Nos. 517 and 518). About seventy-five years ago the temple was considerably improved and new structures were added during the pontificate of Abhinava Ādisēna-Bhaṭṭāraka (No. 520). The inscription recording this information is dated in Śaka 1787 corresponding to the 2529th year of the *mōksha* of Vardhamāna.

 An interesting monument of late Vijayanagara workmanship kept in front of this Jaina temple is a stone chariot on wheels, represented as being dragged by a pair of caparisoned elephants. This is said to have been brought from the Veṅkaṭaramaṇasvāmin temple in the fort at Gingee. A seated image of a Jaina *Tīrthaṅkara* (Nēminātha) set up in the compound of this temple is similarly alleged to have been brought here from a Jaina site at Mylapore in Madras. From the *Tirunūrrandādi* of the Jain divine Avirōdhiyālvār *(cf. Ajātaśatru),* it is learnt that a Jaina temple of Nēmichandra was in existence at Mylapore in his period and that the Jaina devotees, anticipating danger to the temple from the threatening erosion of the sea, had the image removed to Śirrāmūr. It is possible that the two images are identical, and it is unfortunate that this Jaina image which had been removed to this village with so much devotion, is now lying neglected in a corner of that temple.

**[*Poet Ellappa-Nayinar.*](cnt3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 80. No. 401 from Tiruppālaippandal in the Tirukkoyilur taluk of the South Arcot district is not dated, but can, from its paleography, be attributed to the 16th century A.D. It registers a gift of lands, a house site and a portion of the daily offered food from the temple by the authorities to Kāliṅgarāyar Uṇṇāmulai-Nayinār **Ellappa-Nayinār,** for having composed an *ulā* in honour of the god Madhyasthanāthasvāmin at Tiruppālaippandal. From the verse inscriptions engraved on the *gōpura* at Tiruvaṇṇāmalai (No. 419 of 1928-29) and Pandanallūr (Nos. 117 and 118 of 1931-32), it is learnt that Ellappa-Nāyanār was a poet who flourished in the court of Śevvappa-Nāyaka of Tanjore in about A.D. 1572 (Ep. Rep. for 1928-29. Para II, para. 69 and for 1931-32, Part II, para 49). He was the author of the *Aruṇagiri-purāṇam,* and it is further learnt from the present record that he was the author of an *ulā* also. It has not however been possible to trace this work now.

**[*Chandraśēkhara, author of Iraiśai-purāṇam*](cnt3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 Another inscription relating to the composition of a literary work in Tamil is No. 485 from Elavānāśūr in the same taluk. It registers a gift of and and a house-site to the author of the work called *Iraiśai-purāṇam,* (i.e.), a *st halapurāṇam* on the god Śiva of Iraivānaraiyūr, which was the old form of 15
