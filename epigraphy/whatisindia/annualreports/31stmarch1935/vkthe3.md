**THE VIJAYANAGAR KINGS**

**[*Uttama-Nambi and Chakrarāya*](cn2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
Another inscription of Dēvarāya (No. 60) from Śrīraṅgam consists of 3 verses in praise of the king. Uttama-Nambi and Chakrarāya. The first verse extolling the king, plays a pun on the words expressing the cyclic years and states that having become king (Pārthiva) in the year Pārthiva and destroyed his enemies *(ripu-vyayam)* in Vyaya, Dēvarāya would become all-conquering (Sarvajit) and the all supporting (Sarvadhāri). Since the cyclic year Pārthiva corresponded to Śaka 1327, we have to identify the king with Dēvarāya I. The second verse states that Uttama-Nambi got from king Dēvarāya, a pearl umbrella, a big *kāhaḷa,* two lamps, a *bhadrāsana* and similar royal emblems. In the last year’s Report (para. 63), it has been stated that Uttama-Nambi was the recipient of similar gifts from king Prauḍhadēvarāya (Dēvarāya II), but from the present inscription, it would appear that he received the same honours from Dēvarāya I also. The third verse of the inscription states that in Manmatha (Śaka 1337) an image of Garuḍa was consecrated by Chakrarāya. The consecration of this image is also mentioned in the *Kōyilolugu* where it is stated that the copper-image of the deity which had been endowed by the Chōḷa king had become mutilated in the troublous times *(kalāpam)* that followed and was recast and set up in the Maṇavāḷaperumāḷ-tirumaṇḍapa by Chakrarāya in the cyclic year Manmatha. This Garuḍa image seems to be different from the one mentioned in No. 50 which is stated to have been consecrated by Chakrarāya in the year Viśvāvasu, corresponding to Śaka 1347.

**[*Vira-and Vijaya-Bhupati.*](cn2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 44. Vira-Bhūpati, the son of Bukka II and Vijaya-Bhūpati, son of Dēvarāya are each represented by a single inscription from Śrīraṅgam. Of these, No. 59, belonging to the former is dated in Śaka 1331 and records a gift of money for the conduct of a nine-day festival to god Raṅganātha in the month of Tai ending with the king’s natal star Punarvasu. This was entrusted to Uttama-Nambi who held an important position in the temple in the time of Dēvarāya II *(Ep. Rep.,* for 1937-38, para. 63). The inscription of Vijaya (No. 53) is dated in the cyclic year Śubhakṛit, corresponding to Śaka 1344 and registers the gift of the village Kumarakkuḍi as a *daṇḍikai-jīvitam* to the same Uttama-Nambi, the *sthānika* of the temple.

**[*Devaraya II.*](cn2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 45. Two records of Dēvarāya II (Nos. 199 and 55) both from the Trichino- poly district, dated in Śaka 1352 and 1351, register gift of two villages named Paṇṇaṅguḍi and Hastichōḷēndramaṅgalam to the temples at Tiruveḷḷarai and Śrīraṅgam by **Vyāsa Bhārati¸** the disciple of Rāmachandra-Sarasvati and the son of Dakshiṇāmūrti and Marakatavallī of Chillamatāgrahāram. This records consist of several Sanskrit verses which are stated to have been composed by the donor himself. This Vyāsa-Bhārati figures also in an inscription at Lālguḍi (No. 131 of 1929) of the time of the same king.

**[*Anna-Chauṇḍapa and Annadāta-Uḍaiyar.*](cn2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 Another inscription (No. 7) of the king, dated in Śaka 135\[5\] records the gift of the villages Koḍiyālam and Śirudavūr by, \[Anna\]-Chauṇḍappa, son of Āḍitya- dēva for conducting a car-festival in the temple at Śrīraṅgam on the day of Uttirāḍam, the natal star of his father (Āditya). This Anna-Chauṇḍappa is known from No. 134 of 1936-37 from Jaṁbukēśvaram, as the donor of some structural additions to that temple. The donor of another gift to the Śrīraṅgam temple was Annadāta-Da\[ṇ\]ṇāyaka-Uḍaiyar of the Harita-gōtra (No. 34) who must be different from Mahāpradhāni Annadāta-Uḍaiyar, son of Chauṇḍappa-Uḍaiyar mentioned in No. 568 of 1902 as the latter was of the Vasishṭha-gōtra. No. 57 from Śrīraṅgam refers of a certain Aṇṇapa-mantri whose son Śrīpati is said to have constructed a window *(dvāra)* to the pinnacle *(valabhī)* of the *vimāna* of the temple. The identification of this Aṇṇapa however, is not clear.

 The benefactions of Chakrarāya (mentioned in para. 43 above), the brother of Uttama-Nambi to the Raṅganātha temple at Śrīraṅgam are noticed in a Tamil verse inscription secured from the place (No. 50). It is known that Chakrarāya flourished in the time of Dēvarāya II *(Ep. Rep.,* for 1937-38, para. 63). The cyclic years quoted from Krōdhi to Saumya in this record when the gifts were made severally must be equated with the Śaka years 1346 to 1351. No. 46 which is dated in the cyclic year Virōdhikṛit registering a sale of the village
