**GENERAL**

with spears. The unfinished *gōpura* at the south entrance in the last *prākāra,* which forms the portals as it were to this temple-city has evoked the admiration of Fergusson by its massive and dignified proportions, and if it had only been completed, it would have risen up to a height of nearly 300 feet, and would have been a remarkable achievement of Indian temple engineering.

**I**conographically the temple offers a wide scope for study, boasting of an almost complete gallery of all the images requires for worship according to the *Vaishṇavāgamas.* Apart from the images of the gods, *Ālvārs* and *Āchārya-purushas* for whom there are well-made bronzes kept in the temple, some of which may be attributed to the 12th and 13th centuries A.D., there are two unique images which deserve special mention, *viz.,* **Dasmūrtis—**a group of ten images taken in procession round the temple on all important occasions and **Annamūrti,** the presiding deity of the temple kitchen. The latter is represented as a two-armed image holding a bolus of curd-rice in one hand and a *kalaśa* containing *pāyasa* in the other. In the *prabhā-maṇḍala* behind the head are carved the emblems *śaṅkha* and *chakra.* The Pādma-saṁhitā (Chapter XXVIII) describes the Annamūrti image thus :â€”

> Purṇēndu-bimba-madhyasthē sitepadmē vikasvarē \|  
> āsīnaṁ dhavaḷ-ākāraṁ nīlakuñjita-mūrdhajam \|\|\|  
> dukūla-kshauma-varanaṁ bālayōgi-vibhūshaṇam \|\|  
> kaladhautamayaṁ Pātraṁ pāyas-ānnēna pūritam \|\|\|  
> bibhrāṇaṁ dakshiṇē hastē dadhyōdanam=ath=ētarē \|\|  
> dhyāyēd=akshatriyam dhīmān japēt tad-gata-mānasaḥ \|\|

The temple is very rich in inscriptions in which kings of the several South Indian dynasties, *viz.,* Chōḷas, Pāṇḍyas, Hoysaḷas, the Vijayanagara kings and the Madura Nāyakas, are well represented. thus testifying to the uniform patronage that it had enjoyed under successive rulers.
