**THE MADURA NAYAKAS**

**[*A posthumous(?) grant of Tirumala-Nāyaka.*](cnt3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
(75. A copper-plate record (C. P. No. 25) in the possession of a member of the **Śrīkaṇṭhākāśavāsi** family of Jambukēśvaram belongs to the Madura Nāyaka ruler **Tirumala-Nāyaka** of the family of Nāgama- Nāyaka. It is dated in Śaka 1584, Śubhakṛit, and contains astronomical details giving the English equivalent A.D. 1662, March 24, Monday. As Tirumala-Nāyaka is known to have passed away in February 1659 A.D. the present record which purports to have been issued in March, A.D. 1662, ‘ while Tirumala-Nāyaka was ruling’, is open to suspicion, unless it be that it had been issued earlier during the life-time of the Nāyaka ruler and was actually engraved and granted to the donee later, on the day specified in the copper-plate. It will be hazardous to lengthen the reign of this Nāyaka ruler to A.D. 1662 on the strength of this solitary grant. In the present record, it is also further stated that members of the Ākāśavāsi family were the *kulagurus* of the earlier Madura Nāyakas and a certain Śrīkaṇṭhākāśavāsi is said to have been the recipient of five villages from his disciple Viśvanātha-Nāyaka. The donee of this grant, Mahādēva-Dīkshita was a later member of the family and was the spiritual preceptor of Tirumala-Nāyaka and received gifts of lands in several villages. He was also the recipient of certain honours and privileges in the temples at Jambukēśvaram, Mātṛibhūtēśvaram, Rāmēśvaram and Chokkanāthapuram. No. 50 states that he died in Viśvāvasu (A.D. 1665-66). It may be noted that the early Madura Nāyaka rulers were Śaiva devotees up to the time of this Tirumala, and that the later members from Chokkanātha onwards were ardent Vaishṇavites who lavished their patronage on the Śrīraṅgam and other Vishṇu temples.)

**[*Chokkanātha-Nāyaka.*](cnt3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 76. Of **Chokkanātha-Nāyaka** there are three Telugu records (Nos. 102 to 104) engraved on the walls of the Garuḍa shrine in the Raṅganātha temple at Śrīraṅgam. Two of them are dated in Śaka 1596 and refer to the construction of a shrine for Ashṭabhuja-Gōpālakṛishṇa between the Kūrattālvār and the Viṭṭhalēśvara shrines, apparently in the fifth *prākāra,* by a certain **Chinna-Bomma-Nāyuḍu of Madura,** and to the gift of land made for providing worship and offerings to this deity and to the image of god Raṅganātha while halting in front of this shrine during festivals. The third record dated in Śaka 1593, Virōdhikṛit (No. 103), is damaged and registers a gift of land to the temple by **Pradhāni Chōḍi- Aḷagādri,** son of Kāpa-Nāyaka and grandson of Chōḍi Aḷagādri-Nāyaka. No. 105, dated in Śaka 1596 has also to be attributed to the same Nāyaka ruler though his name is not mentioned.

 77. The next Nāyaka ruler **Raṅgakṛishṇa Muttu-Vīrappa** figures in No. 106 engraved in the same Garuḍa-maṇḍapa. It is dated in Śaka 1613, Pramōdūta (A. D. 1690, September 8), and refers to Vīrapratāpa **Vīra-Dēvarāya-Mahārāya** ‘ruling at Ghanagiri’, as his overlord. There appears to be some mistake in the name of the Vijayanagara suzerain as quoted, since there was no king of that name about this period except Veṅkaṭa III whose rule was however confined only to the Bellary district *(Sewell’s Hist. Ins. Of S. Ind., p. 290).* It is possible that he was identical with Veṅkaṭa III or his son Śrīraṅga for whom records dated in A.D. 1690 and 1692 are known. The inscription registers the restitution of certain rights and privileges in the Raṅganātha temple to **Kumāra Veṅkaṭa-Varadā- chārya,** son of Varadāchārya and grandson of Āchchi Śrīraṅga-Nārāyanāchārya of the Gārgya-gōtra, which had been in the enjoyment of the family from the time of Uḍaiyavar (Rāmānuja) but had lapsed when some of his ancestors had proceeded to the northern parts to participate in religious disputations with the Śaivas. From this record, it is clear that this Nāyaka ruler was alive till at least September, A.D. 1690, though according to the *Mṛityuñjaya Manuscripts* his last date is said to have been A.D. 1689. This corroborates the date given for him in the *Maduraittalavaralaru.*

**[*Labelled sculptures of some Nayaka chiefs.*](cnt3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
78. The names of a few Nāyaka chiefs and officers are mentioned in the labels (Nos. 126 to 129) engraved on four pillars in a *maṇḍapa* on the bank of the Koḷḷiḍam river, a mile to the east of the Raṅganātha temple, which is known by the name of the Ellaikkarai-maṇḍapa on account of its situation near the boundary wall separating the *dēvadāna* lands of the Ranganātha temple from those of the Jambukēśvaram temple.
