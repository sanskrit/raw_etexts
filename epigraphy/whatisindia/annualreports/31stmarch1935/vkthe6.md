**THE VIJAYANAGAR KINGS**

and that he made some gift of land to the temple in the names of the king, Varadāchchiyamman and Chikka-Veṅkaṭādri.

**[*Members of the Salakam family.*](cn2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 53. A few members of the Salakam family, to which Varadāmbā, queen of Achyuta belonged, figure in the years’ collection. Prominent among these was Mahāmaṇḍalēśvara Salakarāja Peda-Tirumalayyadēva-Mahārāja, the brother- in-law and the *Sarvaśiraḥpradhāni* of the king mentioned in No. 334 form the Cuddapah district. He is introduced in this inscription with a number of birudas such as *Kāvērī-vallabha, Kaṭaka-pratichūrakāra,* etc. He is also mentioned to Śaka 1456. His father’s name is given in No. 40 from Śrīraṅgam as Salakaya- dēva-Mahārāja, and in No. 9 as Peddayadēva-Mahārāja. The latter inscription jamma, the daughter of Salakam Timma (Tirumala). Tirumala’s mother was Anantamman (No. 70) and his wife was Periya-Konamman (No. 3).

 A subordinate under Salakam Timma in the Cuddapah district was Mahā- maṇḍalēśvara Tirumalayya, son of Jagatāpi Sōmalarāju, who held the Chennūru division as his *nāyankara* (No. 379). The epithet ‘ Jagatāpi’ is also known to have been borne by members of the Telugu-Chōḷa family like Daṇḍidēva-Chōḷa- Mahārāja (No. 345 of 1920), Koṇḍayadēva-Chōḷa-Mahārāja *alias* Kulaśēkharay- yan (Ep. Rep. for 1932-33, para. 41), Gaṅgayadēva-Chōḷa-Mahārāja (No. 308 of 1935-36), Errayadēva-Chōḷa-Mahārāja (No. 414 of 1912), and it is possible that Tirumalayya of the present record was connected with this family.

**[*Achyutaâ€™s officers.*](cn2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 Some of the king’s officers and subordinate chiefs mentioned in the collection are : *Avasaram* Mallarasayyan, son of Āndalai Śaṅkarasar of the Śāṇḍilya- gōtra (Nos. 25, 37 and 39) ; (his ?) brother’s son, another Śaṅkarasar (No. 36) ; *Aḍaipattu* Śiru-Mallappa-Nāyakar (No. 26), probably identical with Chikka Mallappa- Nāyaka of Penugoṇḍa mentioned in No. 163 of 1922 ; Ayyan Maṅgarasayyan (with unspecified office), different from (?) *Karaṇikam* Maṅgarasa, the governor under Kṛishṇadēvarāya (No. 289) ; Mahāmaṇḍalēśvara Chennaya-Bālaya of the Kāśyapa-gōtra with titles ‘Uraiyūr-puravarādhīśvara,’ ‘Chōḷakula-tilaka’ etc. (No. 2) ; Rāmābhaṭṭan, son of Bhūtanātha Titti shṇa-Bhaṭṭar of the Gautama-gōtra (No. 114) ; Ayyan Varadappayyan (No. 245) probably identical with Kṛishṇāpuram Varadappayar of No 118 of 1931 ; (minister) Ayyaparasa with his *nāyaṅkara* of Ghaṇḍikōṭa-sīma (No. 341) ; *Rāyasam* Veṅgaḷappa (No. 10). son of Pōchirāju Timmaya evidently the same as Udayagiri Vīraṇoḍayala Timmarāja whose preceptor is said to have been Tāḷḷapākkam Tirumalayyaṅgāru (No. 393) ; Bācharasa referred to as the *kāryakarta* of the king, governing the Ghaṇḍikōṭa-sīma (No. 337) ; and lastly Kachchi Viśvanātha-Nāyaka, probably the founder of the Madura Nāyaka line of rulers and a hitherto unknown son of his named Tirumalai-Nāyaka who consecrated some image in the temple at Śrīraṅgam in Śaka 1460, Viḷambi, for the merit of prince Chikkarāya (Nos. 43 and 111).

**[*Sadasivadeva-Maharaya.*](cn2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 54. More than a dozen inscriptions are dated in the reign of Sadāśivadēva-Mahārāya which come mainly from the Cuddapah district. They mention his feudatories of the Nandyāla and Āravīḍu families. Of the former are Timmayadēva (No. 335), (his son) Nāraparāja (No. 388) who was given Ghaṇḍikōṭa-sīma as nāyaṅkara by the king, Nandēla Avubhaḷarāja (Nos. 364, 368 and 371), his son Vōbuḷarāja and the latter’s son Pina Vōbuḷarāja (Nos. 367, 369 and 370). Of the latter family, the members represented are Rāmarāja China or Timmayadēva-Mahārāja (Nos. 331, 373 and 374) and Aubaḷadēva-Mahārāja son of Rāmarāja Kōnēṭi-Ayyan (No. 206). Two more chiefs with the title Dēvachōḷa-Mahārāja mentioned in his records are Mahāmaṇḍalēśvara Manumballi Chen- nakēśvarāja (No. 373) and Manumballi Gaṅgayya (No. 331).

**[*Irregular levy of taxes on certain villages redressed.*](cn2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 No. 388 records that Peḍa Mallamarāja, son of Andugula Parvatarāja, under orders of Nārapa mentioned above, remitted the taxes *grāma-kaṭṇam and suṅka-sthāvaram* on the *agrahāra* villages Koppōlu *alias* Kṛishṇarāyapuram and Tippalūru which were hitherto being collected wrongly, as the villages had been granted formerly as *sarvamānya* by king Kṛishṇadēvarāya. The village Koppōlu referred to hers is evidently the same as the one said to have been presented to
