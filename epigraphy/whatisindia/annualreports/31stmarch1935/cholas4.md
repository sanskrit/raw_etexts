that the record bears at the end in the Telugu-Kannaḍa script the signature Śrī-Abhinutavāku, which was evidently the king’s official surname or title.

The king Bhuvana-Triṇētra Vaidumba-Mahārāja is clearly identical with the king of the name whose coronation is mentioned in an inscription from Upparapalle in the Cuddapah district dated Śaka 894 (*Ep. Rep.* for 1906, page 66, paragraph 52). Regarding a later chief of this family named Bhīmarāja who ruled over this part of the country in about A.D. 1056 (Śaka 978) see below, paragraph 23.
