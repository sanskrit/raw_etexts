**PART II.**

verse engraved on the beam of the verandah, he has emphatically expressed his adherence to the Śaiva creed and describes all other religious faiths, including probably Jainism, as *vipaksha-vṛitti.* The word ‘Taṁchahara\[ka\]’ can be interpreted as a title of Mahēndravarman and to mean ‘he who captured Tañcha (Tanjore)’. From the Vēlūrpāḷaiyam plates, we know that Siṁhavishṇu, the father of Mahēndravarman, claimed to have conquered the Chōḷas, and in support of this fact, it may be pointed out that Kañjanūr in the Tanjore district bore the surname Siṁhavishṇu-chatuevēdimangalam in Chōḷa times (No. 265 of 1907), testifying to its connection with the king of this name. As Pallava influence began to be felt in the Chōḷa territory only from this period, it is possible that Mahēndravarman who may have participated in this southern expedition in the company of his father had adopted this title.

4. On the stone platform of the same cavern is found the expression ‘Svasti Śrī-Rājēntra’ of the fuller name Rājēndra-Chōḷadēva (No. 131) in Grantha characters attributable to the 11th century A. D., while close to it is another complete inscription (No. 130) in characters of the same period consisting of a Sanskrit verse, containing an announcement by a certain Vādipraḷaya-Bhairava of his arrival at this place after having vanquished disputants and after having visited Karnāṭa-maṇḍala. It is not clear if he was a Jaina ascetic, but from the name ‘Bhairava’ we have perhaps to conclude that he was a protagonist of the Śaiva cult and that he settled himself in this place, under the patronage of either Rājarāja I or his son, were ardent Śaivas. It may be mentioned how-ever, that the title ‘a Bhairava of disputants’ was borne by Jaina monks also.
