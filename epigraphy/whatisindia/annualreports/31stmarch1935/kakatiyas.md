****KAKATIYAS****

 29. Of the five Kākatīya inscriptions (Nos. 235, 240, 260, 278 and 282) secured during the year under review, the earliest is a fragmentary record of Mahāmaṇḍalēśvara Gaṇapati, bearing the Śaka date 1182, Siddhārthin. In another record (No. 282) the king bears the epithet ‘Anumakoṇḍapurāvarādhīśvara’ and is said to have been ruling the country with his capital (nelevīḍu) at Oruṅgallu. Rudrāmbā, the daughter and successor of Gaṇapati, is introduced with  
**[Rudradēva Maharaja and the body guard Appanaboll nayaka .](contents2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
the usual male name Mahāmaṇḍalēśvara Rudradēva-Mahārāja in No. 240 form Vaḍḍemkuṇṭa, which records a gift of land made to the temple of Maiāradēva at Vaddhagikuṇṭa called ‘abhinava kaṭaka’ (new military station) by the bodyguard (aṅgaraksha) Appana Bollināyaka, No. 260 bearing the date Śaka 1230 belongs to the reign of Pratāparudra**  
[Pārataparudra.](contents2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
the last king of the family who wad ruling from his nelevīḍu at Oruṅgallu. It introduces his officer (whose name is lost in the damaged portion of the stone) as administering from Ghaṇḍikōṭa, the district of Mulki-nāṇḍu, Penampāḍi (probably the same as Pennapari-nāḍu of other inscriptions ; S.I.I. Vol. IV. No. 798), Pottapi-nāṇḍu, Peḍakallu, Nāntavāḍi etc. From No. 406 of 1911 we learn that Ambadēva-Mahārāja was ruling in Śaka 1209 the districts of Ghaṇḍikōṭa, Muliki-nāṇḍu, Rēnāṇḍu, Sakali, Yēruva, Pottapi-nāṇḍu and others from his capital at Vallūri-paṭṭaṇa. His last known date is Śaka 1224 and it is likely that he might have continued to hold this territory till Śaka 1230 the date of the record under review. If this surmise is correct the officer referred to above must be Ambadēva himself. The latest record in the year’s collection belonging to Pratāparudra comes from Dāmagaṭla in the Nandikotkur taluk of the Kurnool district and is dated in Śaka 1233, Virōdhikṛit. It states that Dāmagaṭḷa was under the nāyaṅkara administration of Vīḍyamu Kommarāja.

**[Ambadeva probably son of Amba-Kshmapa](contents2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
30. There are only two records (Nos. 229 and 207) of Ambadēva in the current year’s collection. No. 229 from Nīlagaṅgavaram is dated in Śaka 1212, Vikṛiti (=A.D. 1290-91) and records a gift of the village Mollala-Kallūru alias Śivapura to a certain Mallināthayya, a resident of Tripurāntakakshētra, by Ambadēva. The pedigree of the chief is given as follows :— In the family of the Kāyasthas, who were Kshatriyas, was born Gaṅgaya-Śahiṇi, ; his sister Chandaladēvī was married to Amba-Kshmāpa ; their sons Janārdana and Tripurāridēva ; the latter’s younger brother Ambadēva. Ambadēva is stated to have captured the regal fortune of Guriṇḍāla Gaṇādhipa who was a comet to the Māḷava king’. Who this Gaṇadhipa was and which Māḷava king is referred to in the record it is not possible to say. But the former may perhaps be the same as **śrīpati Ganapati,** whom Ambadēva is known to have CO nqured (*Ep. Rep.* for 1906, Parat II par44). Guriṇḍāla is evidently the village called Guriṇḍa-sthala, Guriṇḍāla-sthala or Guṇḍāla occurring in the inscriptions of the Guntur district (modern Gurzala in the Guntur district) (Nos. 569 and 596 of 1909, and No. 307 of 1934-35). The record is important as it specifies for the first time the relationship between Gaṅgaya-Śāhiṇi
