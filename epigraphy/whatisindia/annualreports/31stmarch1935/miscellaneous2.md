****MISCELLANEOUS****

Daṇṇāyakankōttai in the same distrcit *(Ep. Rep.* for 1907, p. 66), wherein he and his father Mādhava are referred to as local governors during the Hoysaḷa rule. Kētaya’s inscriptions are also found at Kolumam (Saṅgrāmanallūr) in the Udumalpet taluk of the same district (Nos. 158 and 159 of 1909).

**[*Purushōttama-Gajapati and his sāmanta Ajama-Khan.*](contents4.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 78. Two records of the Gajapati kings have been secured from the Guntur and the Kurnool district. One of these (No. 226) dated in Śaka 1406, Krōdhin, belongs to **pusushōttama Gajapati Maharaja,** who calls himself ‘Jagannātha-varaprasāda’ and mentions **Ajama-Khan** as his *Sāmantarāya-Mahāpātra.* The other record (No. 277) is a fragment which mentions some gifts of lands given for the merit of Kapilēśvaradēva-Mahāraja.

**[*The Travancore ruler Vira-Ramavarman.*](contents4.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 79. The Travancore king Vīra-Rāmavarman figures in this year’s collection in a record coming from Ambasamudram in the Tinnevelly district (No. 202). The rules of Travancore had extended their authority over portions of the Tinnevelly district in the 16th century A. D., and several records of Vīra- Rāmavarman as well as of his predecessor Vīra-Udaiyamārttāṇḍavarman have been copied in this district *(Ep. Rep.* for 1926-27. p. 105). The present record is dated in Kollam 722 and registers the appointment of a certain Śattaipperumāḷ-Danmakkūttan of the spiritual lineage of Meykaṇḍār, to supervise the supply of garlands, etc., to the temple of Vīra-Mārttāṇḍēśvaramuḍaiya-Nāyanār and the accounts of the *maṭha* attached thereto, situated in Udaiyamārttāṇḍa-chaturvēdimaṅgalam. The *agrahāra* and the temple must have therefore come into existence during the reign of Udaiyamārttāṇḍavarman. **Vīra-Ramavarman** of the present record was a contemporary of the Vijayanagara viceroy Viṭthaladēva-Mahārāja and it was in commemoration of the latter’s visit of Suchīndram that the big *gōpura* of the Śiva temple there was built in Kollam 722.

**[*The Arantāṅgi Chief Achchutappa-Nayaka-Toṇḍaimān.*](contents4.html#_ftnref1100)**  
80. No. 116 from Kīramaṅgalam in the Pattukkottai taluk (Tanjore distrcit) is a fragmentary record which simply mentions a certain **Achchutappa- Nayaka-Toṇḍaiman** and the year Sarvadhārin. We know that the *araśu* of Arantāṅgi named Āṇḍiyappa Achyutanāyaka-Toṇḍaimān, son of Tyāgaraśar Narasānāyaka was administering this region in A.D. 1577 (No. 511 of 1925) and that he was the successor of Ponnambalanātha-Toṇḍaimān (Ep. Ind., Vol. XXI, p. 122). The present record seems to be assignable to that Achyuta-Nāyaka, in which case the cyclic year Sarvadhārin would correspond to A.D. 1588-89.

**[*An agreement between the Tanjore ruler Ēkoji.Mahārāja and the Dutch East India Company.*](contents4.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 81. A photograph of a copper-plate (C.P. No. 11) preserved in the Museum at Batavia was received in this office for decipherment through Dr. Gravely, Superintendent of the Government Museum, Madras. The existence of this plate is noticed in the *District Gazetteer* of Tanjore, p. 41, but its purport had not so far been made out. The plate is engraved in Tamil and is dated in A.D. 1676, Naḷa, Mārgali 30. It registers an agreement made by the Tanjore Marāṭha king **Ēkōji-Mahārāja,** who styles himself the agent and general of the Bijāpūr-Sultān, entering into an alliance of mutual friendship with the Honourable Dutch East India Company and confirming certain trading and colonising rights that had been granted to them in the time of **Chokkanātha-Nāyaka** of Madura in A.D. 1674 and **Vijayarāghava-Nāyaka** of Tanjore in A.D. 1669. The Company was represented by two Dutch Officers who are named Siñau Bikruvōvar and Siñau Thomasu-Vandero, acting under the orders of Siñau Amarāla-Mahārāja (Admiral) Rokkoloppu Von Guñju **(Rijkloī or Rycklof Van Goens),** the general of Malaṅgara and the Governor of the Dutch Possessions in Ceylon, Coromandel, Śālakkarai and Madurai coasts. Prof. K.A. Nilakantha Śastri of the Madras University has brought to my notice the existence of a Dutch version of this agreement published as
