**THE VIJAYANAGARA KINGS**

**[*Uttamanambi and Chakraraya.*](cnt3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
These two famous brothers of the Kāṥyapa-gōtra belonged to the family of the Pūrvaṥikhā sect of Brahmans who are said to have migrated to Śrīraṅgam along with the Vaishṇava saints Periyālvār (Vishṇuchitta) and his daughter Āṇḍāḷ from Śrīvilliputtūr. The genealogy of this family is collected in a recently published pamphlet, called the *Uttamanambi-vaṁṥa-prabhāvam.* Garuḍavāhana-Paṇḍita, the contemporary of the great Rāmānuja, who is stated to have been in charge of a hospital in the Raṅganātha temple, is said to have belonged to this family. Uttama-Nambi and Chakrarāya lived in the time of Dēvarāya and through their influence, the king is said to have granted the revenue of as many as 52 villages to the Raṅganātha temple. Some of these facts are also mentioned in the temple chronicle called the *Kōyilolugu.* A Sanskrit work named the *Lakshmīkāvyam* composed by Tirumalainātha-Uttamanambi, another member of this family who lived about this period, contains some information on the genealogy of the author’s predecessors and this has been noticed in *Epigraphia Indica,* Volume XVIII, page 139. A few verses in Sanskrit in praise of this Chakrarāya are stated in No. 82 to have been composed by an ascetic named **Vyāsabhārati,** who is also referred to in an inscription at Lālguḍi (No. 131 of 1928-29) as being the disciple of Rāmachandra-yati and the son of Dakshiṇā- mūrti and Marakatavallī of the Chillamantāgrahāra in Toṇḍai-maṇḍalam.

**[*Agreement between the Valaṅgai and Iḍaṅgai classes*](cnt3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 64. Anther record or Dēvarāya from Elavānāṥūr (No. 490), dated in Śaka 1359 is of interest, as it relates to an agreement between the *Valaṅgai* and *Iḍaṅgai* Agreement between the *Valaṅgai and Iḍaṅ-gai classes.* classes of Valudilambaṭṭu-ṥāvaḍi, which had assembled in the *maṇḍapa* of the Ūrbāgaṅ-koṇḍaruḷiya-Nāyanār at Eraivānaraiyūr for the purpose of the deciding as to how best they could withstand unauthorished levy of taxes by the king’s officers. The following resolutions were passed :-

> 1\. As the tenants of this *maṇḍalam* had been harassed by the king’s
> officers and the *jīvitakkāras,* they agreed to adhere to the old
> rates of taxation only, both in kind and money, and to pay towards
> *tarakkāṇikkai* (quit-rent) only one *paṇam per mā* (of cultivated
> land).  
> 2. No other taxes such as *nallerudu. narpaṥu, narkiḍā, jōḍi,
> viniyōgam, nērōlai-kāṇikkai and kudirai-kāṇikkai* was to be levied.  
> 3. The tax payable per loom by the *Kaikkōḷas* should not be
> altered.  
> 4. The Brāhmaṇas and the Veḷḷāḷas born in the *rājya* should not allow
> *vāravari* to be collected, neither should they be guilty of
> *nāṭṭudrōha* by writing accounts, taking service with the *bhaṇḍāra*
> in the *taravukkaḷam* or with the *araṥukkārar or jīvitakkāra,* nor of
> carrying tales against them to the authorities.  
> 5. Cases classifiable as *ṥerra-kurram* (homicide ?) should be
> properly adjudged by them in full assembly, leaving out cases of
> *karra-kurram* (minor offence ?).  
> 6. Any one purchasing as *mānya or jīvita* the service lands other
> than (of) their own (group) and those collecting taxes other than what
> is due to be paid as *rājakaram,* should also be considered a
> *nāṭṭu-drōhis.*  
> 7. As regards the collection of *āyam, 1½ paṇam* per loom should be
> levied as *nūlāyam,* this rate being halved in the case of parai-tari
> looms.  
> 8. The *jīvitakkārar* should not cultivate lands other than those
> assigned to them by the Ūravar (assembly).

 The gift of the village Suravipaṭṭu to a certain Sambandāṇḍār presiding over the *maṭha* at Tiruvaṇṇāmalai in Śaka 1359 is recorded in No. 384 from Śoraiyap-paṭṭu, South Arcot district. A Telugu record (No. 242) from Kōḍūru in the Cuddapah district registers the gift of that village to the temple of Chennakē-ṥava-Perumāḷ bi Mahāmaṇḍalēṥvara **Avubaḷadēva-Mahārāja** in the cyclic year Saumya, which evidently corresponded to Śaka 1351 in Dēvarāya’s reign.
