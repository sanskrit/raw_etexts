****WESTERN CHALUKYAS****

**[Bhūlōkamalladēva and his subordinate sakaraDēvachōlamahārāja, son of Bhimadēva.](contents2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
24. Of the two inscriptions Nos. 276 and 315 of this dynasty, the former secured at Kuṅkanūru in the Pattikonda taluk of the Kurnool district, belongs to the reign of Bhūlōkamalladēva (Sōmēśvara III) and records a gift of land made by Mahāmaṇ ḍalēśvara Sakara-dēvachōḷamahārāja, son of Mahāmaṇḍalēśvara Bhīmadēva and Manneya Mācharasa to the temple of Rāmēśvaradēva at Kukuvanūru in Sauḷu—70 included in Naravāḍi 500 district on a day in Chāḷukyāvikrama (wrong for Bhūlōkamalla) year 3, Kīlaka (A.D. 1129-30), when the king was camping at *Jayantīpura.* The chief Sakara-Dēvachōḷamahārāja is called ‘ a jewelled lamp to the family to Kalikāla who had constructed the embankment to the Kāvērī.’ From this epithet and from the title ‘ Dēvachōḷamahārāja’ applied to him, he may be supposed to be a prince of the Telugu-Chōḷa family, though his place in the genealogy cannot be definitaly ascertained. A record from Peddamuḍiyam (No. 347 of 1905) mentions a certain Mahāmaṇḍalēśvara *Bhīmarasa* as a feudatory of *Jagadēkamalla II* (A.D. 1138-1149), who may probably be connected with the Bhīmadēva of the present record. Since the latter’s son Sakara lived in the time of Bhūlōkamalla, the predecessor of Jagadēkamalla II, and Bhīmarasa’s family name is not disclosed in the inscription, the proposed connection can only be established by future discoveries of a more definite character. It is noteworthy that the village Kukuvanūru is called in the inscription as a *Ghaṭikāsthāna* i.e. a seminary. *Naravāḍi—*500, where this village was situated is probably the same as Naḷavāḍi-vishaya which comprised a portion of the Kurnool district. The existence of Western Chāḷukya sway in the Kurnool and Anantapur districts and of a line of Telugu-Chōḍa feudatories under them is testified to by a number of stone inscriptions secured in that area.\*

**[Trailokyamalla Hemmāḍ dēva-Mahārēja,a Chāḷukya chief.](contents2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 25. The other record (No. 315) mentions a hitherto unknown chief Mahāmaṇdalēśvara Trailōkyamalla Hemmāḍidēva-Mahārāja and is dated in the Bhūlōka\[malla\*\] year 54, Durmati. Since the name of the chief is familiar among the Western Chāḷukyas and the date refers to the Bhūloka \[malla\*\] reckoning the record may be considered to be a Chāḷukyan document. But the period when the chief flourished is not easy to determine as the date offers a little difficulty for calculation. The cyclic year Durmati did not fall in the reign of Bhūlōkamalla nor did it correspond to the 54th year of the Bhūlōkamalla era. It, however, corresponded to the 74th year of this era which fell in A.D. 1221- 02. The text *Bhulōkad-eyyattanālkaneya* is evidently a mistake for *Bhulōkadeppattanālkaneya* and if this emendation is accepted, we must search for a Western Chalukya chief in about A.D. 1200 in the Cuddapah distrcit. The mention of Bhūlōkamalla era in the Cuddapah distrcit in the 13th century A.D. is a reminiscence of the Western Chāḷukya sway in the tract which was immediatly under the Telugu-Chōḍas in that period.
