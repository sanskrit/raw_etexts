**[Malayamuna Vishṇuvardhanadēva-Chakravartin in Saka 1203.](contents2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
In No. 246 which was also secured at Kumāradēvam it was stated that Malayamandu Vishṇuvardhanadēva-Chakravartin was the reigning king and that a certain Mahādēva-Nāyaka provided for a perpectual lamp in the temple of Sōma nātha-Mahādēva at Tilatīrtha. The record bears the date Śaka 1203, Vṛisha (A.D. 1281). From the prefix ‘Malayamandu’ and ‘Malayamuna’ applied respectively to this king and to Gaṇapatidēva of No. 249, it may be surmised that they belonged to the same family. Since Vishṇuvardhana is a name familiar among the Eastern Chāḷukyas, it is likely that the king is identical with Vishṇuvardhana-Chakravartin or Mahārāja figuring as a donor in Śaka 1221 in No. 312 of 1930-1931 and in Nos. 125 and 147 of S.I.I., Vol. V, dated respectively in Śaka 1218 and 1222. In what way Gaṇapati was connected with Vishṇuvardhana or his family must, however, be cleared up by future discoveries only.
