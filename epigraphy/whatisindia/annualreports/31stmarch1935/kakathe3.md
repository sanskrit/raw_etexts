**THE KAKATIYAS**

occasions of 3 villages renamed Tammavaram, Vīravaram and Uṇḍīśvarapuram by the chief after the names of his father, mother and himself, to several learned Brahmans. The purpose of the present record is to register the gift, made now, of the village Gōdaparru surnaming it as Uṇḍīśapuram after his own name to a number of learned Brahmans. The other villages granted by him were in the Pāvunāra-vishaya and Vēṅgidēśa, which indicate the extent of his principality. The donor Uṇḍīśvara is said to have held away over many towns in the Guṇṭūri-Vṛitti-dēśa and had his **residence at Sūravaram** which may perhaps be identical with the village of the same name in the present Bhadrachalam taluk of the East Godavari distrcit. He bore the *birudas Rājavēśyā-bhujaṁga, Paramēśara, Dānadīkshāguru, Naḍa-gōṭamala* and *Nandimēru.* It must be noted that the seal of the grant bears the figures of a **couchant bull.**
