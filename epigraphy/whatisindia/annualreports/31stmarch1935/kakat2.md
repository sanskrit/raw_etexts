**THE KAKATIYAS**

Gaṇapati, and the *Kēsari-gadya* mentioned in the inscription may have been issued from a mint empowered by the royal authority.

**[*The coin Kesari-gadya.*](cont.html#_ftnref1100)**  
17. We know from the seal of the Garavapāḍu grant of Gaṇapati and the *Pratāparudrīya* of Vidyānātha (verse 7) that the boar was the emblem of the Kākatīyas. The coins of the dynasty must naturally have borne this emblem on the obverse. Sir Walter Elliot mentions in his *Coins of Southern India* (p. 85), a few Kākatīya coins on which, he says, a couchant bull is found. R. Srinivasaraghava Ayyangar on the other hand has noticed a coin of Kākati-Gaṇapati with the legend *kati* at the top and Gaṇa at the bottom in old Telugu script, the interspace being filled by the ‘ figures of what may either be a lion or a tiger, with open mouth, raised paw, twisted tail, all these very crudely represented by dots and lines.’ *(Journal of Andhra Historical Research Society, Vol. I. p. 139.)* The coin is stated to weigh 56∙25 grains, which is approximately the weight of a *gadyāṇa* in the pre-Vijayanagara period. *(Coinage of the Vijayanagara dynasties* in the Vijayanagara Sex-centenary Commemoration Volume, 1936, p. 106.) The mention of **Kēsari-gadya** in the present record lends for the first time an epigraphical confirmation to the Kākatīya coinage being struck with the lion-emblem, of which only one specimen is so far known. It may, however, be remarked that it was not an absolute rule in the coinage of the Deccan and South India that the royal emblem on the seals of copper-plate grants alone must be represented on the coins as well. The Vijayanagara coins are known to bear on the obverse about a dozen emblems severally, though the royal seal invariably contained the figure of a boar *(ibid).* It is, therefore, not impossible that the coins referred to by Elliot as containing the bull-emblem were also genuine issues of the Kākatīya mint. It is possible that in India, from the earliest period of the punch-managed mints simultaneously with the state-managed ones, which had been empowered to issue coins with distinguishing emblems *(ibid., p. 117)* , and, this would explain the diversity of emblems on the Elliot’s and S. R. Ayyangar’s Kākatīya coins noticed above.

**[*The Rājaguru Viśvēśvara-śiva and his disciples.*](cont.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 18. In No. 293 which bears a date in Śaka 1165, it is stated that Paripūrṇa- śiva, son of Viśvēśvara, who was a pupil of Dharma-śiva made a gift of land for the merit of his father ; the same per sonage figures as a donor in two other epigraphs (Nos. 301 and 294) both dated in Śaka 1174. In all these inscriptions **Viśvēṥvara-śiva** is called the *guru* of Gaṇapatidēva-Mahārāja. We know from the Malkāpuram inscription of Śaka 1183 (No. 94 of 1917) that the Kākatīya Gaṇapati was first initiated into the Śaiva faith by this pontiff *(dīkshāguru),* and since the earliest known inscription mentioning this *guru* as the preceptor of Gaṇapati is dated in Śaka 1174, the *dīkshā* or initiation has been ascribed to or a little earlier than this date, i.e. Śaka 1174 , (A.D. 1252) (Ep. Rep. for 1917, p. 126). Now that an earliest record of Śaka 1165 refers to this fact, we may have to take back the date of the initiation to some time before A.D. 1243. In my *Report* for 1935 (Part II, para. 34), I have suggested from the epi- thet *Parama-Māhēśvara* applied to Gaṇapati in one record dated in Śaka 1140 that the king might have received *Śaiva-dīkshā* from Viśvēśvara-śiva by that year. In the Malkāpuram inscription referred to above we are furnished with a lineage of Śaiva teachers of the Gōḷakī-maṭha from Sadbhāva-śambhu to Viśvēś-vara-śiva covering seven generations with a short interval between Varṇa-śambhu and Kīrti-śambhu. To this is now added, the name of **Paripūrṇa-śiva,** son of Viśvēśvara, who figures for the first time in the inscriptions of Śaka 1165 and 1174 cited above. From Nos. 169 and 171 of 1905 it is learnt that Viśvēśvara called here by the name Viśvēśāchārya had another son named **Śānta-sambhu,** who also figures as Sānta-śiva in a record of Vijayagaṇḍagōpāla dated Śaka 1185 (No. 272 of 1905), in which he is called the disciple of Rājagurudēva, evidently Viśvēś-vara-śiva presiding over the famous Gōḷakī-maṭha, whose spiritual influence ex- tended over three lakhs of villages

**[*The guru Uttama-siva in Rudrambaâ€™s reign.*](cont.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 19. No. 307 belonging to the reign of Rudrāmbā and bearing Śaka date 1193 refers to **Uttama-siva,** as the son of Rājagurudēva. Rājagurudēva mentioned in this record was most probably Viśvēś- vara-śiva himself, for he is referred to as such in two Malkāpuram inscriptions dated in the cyclic year Vibhava (i.e., Śaka 1190) and Śaka 1204 (Nos. 95 and 96 of 1917). This would give him a long period of pontificate from at least before Śaka 1165, if not from Śaka 1140 as stated above, to Śaka 1193. A certain Śrīkaṇṭha-śiva, probably of the Gōḷakī-maṭha, figures in
