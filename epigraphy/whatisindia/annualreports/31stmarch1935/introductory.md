****ANNUAL REPORT FOR 1935-36  
PART II.****

****INTRODUCTORY****

At Śāttūr in the Ramnad district I found a mound locally known as **Mettukkadu** covering an area of about 30 acres, which abounds in potsherds and other relies of ancient habitation, of a variety found in old village sites. The temples at Śrīvillipputtūr and Śaṅkaranayinārkōvil in the Tinnevelly district were inspected and photographs of several interesting objects including the fine spacious dramatic theatre-hall attributed to Tirumala-Nāyaka in the former were taken.  
[***So*me ancient sites and monuments.**  
](contents.html#_ftnref1100) **Virasikhamani** near the latter village, famous for its caverns and beds, *‘Pandava-padukkai’* was also visited and its rock-cut cave temple inspected. The hillock called Vāliyampottai near Tenkāśi abounds in prehistoric burial-urns imbedded in the mound close to each other in various states of preservation. Some of them are reported to have contained fragments of bone. These urns are locally known as *madamadattan-tali* involving a tradition behind the name that ancient people grew shorter and shorter before their death, till they suited the size of the pot to which they were finally consigned and buried. Of great interest are smaller earthen-ware vessels with narrow necks and pointed bottom found here, one of which resembles a vessel of the Ādichchanallūr find of previous years.

**[*Tenkasi and Ukkirankottai.*](contents.html#_ftnref1100)**  
**Kilambur** and **Sivasailam** in the Ambasamudram taluk are also reported to contain a number of sepulchral urns of ancient times adjoining the village sites. Pots of ancient design were also secured at **Ukkirankottai** a village about 18 miles from Tinnevelly. Near this village is a raised area of about 100 acres in which are seen the remnants of an old moat. The temple of Chokkanāchchiyammaṇ here has some fine sculptured friezes and well-carved images of Vishṇu etc. of an early type. The early Pāṇḍyan Vaṭṭeluttu inscriptions of this place establish the identity of the village with **Karavandapura** the native place of Madhurakavi, the minister of the Pāṇḍya king Parāntaka who excavated the Ānaimalai cave temple near Madura. This Karavandapura is known to have had a fort surrounding it in ancient times and the extensive area mentioned above should evidently be the present vestige of this ancient fort. It is not impossible that the name Ukkiraṅkōṭṭai has its origin in the name of the early Pāṇḍya king Ugra-Pāṇḍya called also Ugra-Peruvaludi.

[****Chaitya** at Kurnool.**](contents.html#_ftnref1100)  
2. An inscription (No. 336) engraved on the pedestal of an image (now lost) kept in the open-air Archӕological Museum at Hampi records the construction of a **chaityālaya** at Kandanavrōlu and the consecration of an image of Kuṁṭhu-Tīrthaṅkara therein by Bukka-Mantri, son of Baichaya, who was a (lay) disciple of Dharmabhūshana-Bhaṭṭāraka of the Mūla-saṅgha. Kandanavrōlu is evidently the modern Kurnool. The period when or the circumstance under which an image set up at Kurnool was transferred to Hampi where the pedestal now lies is not known. It is possible that the statement is only a reference to the minister’s foundation at Kurnool.

[***Koṭṭai Bommaya-Nayaka’s sculpture at Kannanur.***](contents.html#_ftnref1100)  
3. At Kaṇṇanūr in the Musiri taluk of the Trichinopoly district (different from the Hoysaḷa capital of the same name which is in the Trichi nopoly taluk) are noticed in a field a furlong off from the present village, a small shrine dedicated to a hero locally known as Bommadēva, who is represented in the sculpture as riding on horse-back with his wife (?) behind him on the saddle, and holding in his right hand a long lance. He should evidently be identical with the Mahāsāmantādhipati of the Vijayanagara king Dēvarāya II named **Kottai Bommaya-Nayaka** who is mentioned in a record from that place (No. 143), as having revived worship in the Alagapperumāḷ temple and made a grant of a village in his *jivita* for right of the present trunk-road con-
