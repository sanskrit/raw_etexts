****VIJAYANAGARA****

61. The earliest inscription of the Vijayanagara dynasty in the collection is (No 114) which belongs to **Bukkaṇa-Oḍeya** [(Bukka I)](contents3.html#_ftnref1100) from Kaṭletala in the South Kanara district. It is dated in Śaka 1282, Plava, and mentions **Madarasa,** the Governor of the Maṅgaḷūru-rajya.

**[Sāvaṇa-Oḍeya.](contents3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
A damaged record of **Śavaṇa-Oḍeya** dated in Śaka 1279, Śubhakṛit, comes from Talapanūru in the Cuddapah district ( No. 327). It registers a gift of land to the gold Mallinātha at Talapunūr by a certain Aṅgabōla Nāyanigāru, for the merit of a lady (name lost), probably queen of Voḍayalu Kamparāja and of his parents Pēravagāru and Nāgasāni. The date given in the record is a mistake for Śaka 1284 with which corresponded Śubhakṛit the cyclic year quoted in the record. It must, however, be noted that Śaka 1279 (current) corresponded to the cyclic year Śubhakṛit according to the Northern cycle. But we cannot be sure if this cycle would have been adopted in this record. According to an inscription from Kāḷahasti ( No. 188 of 1903), the cyclic-year Śubhakṛit was his 15th year, which would give Śaka 1270 as the date of his accession. No. 503 of 1906 calls him ‘the Lord of the Eastern ocean ruling from **Udayagiri-paṭṭanaâ€™.**

**[A chaityalaya at Kandanavrolu (Kurnool).](contents3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
62. An inscription engraved on the pedestal of a missing stone image kept in the open air Archaeological Museum at Hampi (No. 336) records the construction of a *chaityālaya* at the city of Kandanavrōlu (modern Kurnool) and the consecration therein of the image of Kuṁṭhu-Tīrthaṅkara by Immaḍi-Bukkamantrīśvara, who is stated to be the son of **Baichaya-Daṇḍanatha,** who was a disciple of Dharmmabhūshaṇa-Bhaṭṭārakāchārya of the Mūla-saṅgha, the Balātkāra-gaṇa and the Sarasvatī-gachchha. The Śaka year given in the record is lost, but the cyclic year quoted with the other details corresponded to A. D. 1395, March 8, Monday. The inscription may, therefore, be of the time of Harihara II.

After the death of Harihara II in Śaka 1326, the Vijayanagara throne was held for a short time between his son Bukka II and Viruppaṇa till it passed to Dēvarāya I in Śaka 1328. Very few inscriptions are found of Dēvarāya I in the Tamil districts. During his reign, however, from Śaka 1328 to 1344, the province known as the **Rajagambhīra-rajya** was ruled by **Vīra Bhūpatī,** son of Bukka II and **Vijaya-Bhūpati,** son of Dēvarāya himself, the former holding the territory comprising portions of the present South Arcot, Tanjore and Trichinopoly districts and the latter the territory to the north of it. Both of these were probably Dēvarāya’s viceroys.

**[Vira-Bhupati.](contents3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 63. Vīra-Bhūpati is represented by a single record (No. 104) from Māraṅgiyūr in the South Arcot district dated in Śaka 1341, Vikāri. His inscriptions in the Tamil country are found from Śaka 1332 (No. 62 of 1908) to Śaka 13+3 (No. 653 of 1902). The present inscription \[records the sealing down of the taxes payable by the *Kaikkōḷas* residing in the *tirumaḍaiviḷāgam* of the temple at Māriṅgūr to the level obtaining at Iḍaiyaru.

**[Devaraya-Maharaya II](contents3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
64. Of the five records of **Dēvaraya-Maharaya** (Nos. 63, 143, 264, 300, and 312), one from Kaṇṇanūr in the Musiri taluk of the Trichinopoly district (No. 143) dated in Śaka 1340, Plavaṅga, mentions a *mahā-sāmantādhipati* of the king named Kōṭṭai Bommaya-Nāyaka who revived worship in the temple of Alagapperumāḷ at Periya-Kaṇṇanūr, which had been in abeyance for a long time, by confirming the previous gifts made to the temple and by a fresh grant of the village Śirukkaḷḷikkuḍi from his jivita in Mēlai-vaḷḷuvappāḍi nāḍu, a subdivision of **Karikala-kanna-vaḷanadu.** This general probably hailed from the Kanarese districts, if we can judge by his signature in Kanarese at the end of this Tamil inscription. Another officer *(mahāpradhāni)* of the king was Perumaḷadeva-**Dnnayaka** who founded an agrahāra after his name at Śirrāmūr near Paranūr in the South Arcot district (No. 61). This officer is known to us already
