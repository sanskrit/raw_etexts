**THE PANDYAS**

also be assigned to him, from the institution of the service called *Rājākkaḷnāyan- śandi* after his well-known *biruda* (Nos. 270 of 1913, 386 and 391 of 1902). This inscription is dated in the 8th year and registers a gift of 20 *mā* of forest land in Vaḷḷaippākkam and Geḍilanallūr situated in Pādūrparru, made free of taxes, as *tirunāmattukkāṇi* to the temple of Agattīśuram-uḍaiya-Nāyanār at Pādūr. Further it mentions the conferment of the title *Rājanārāyaṇa¬-Brahmārāyan* on Kaṇṇāramudan alias Tirukkaivēl-alagiya-nambi, a *Śivabrāhmaṇa* of the temple, for improving the condition of the Agastīśvara temple, by conducting worship and instituting festivals in it, setting up the processional images of the god and goddess and installing with the help of the villagers other deities therein. From this it may perhaps be inferred that *Rājanārāyaṇa* was also a title borne by this Pāṇḍya king. This Brahmārāyan was also given as *taṇḍilakkai* (remuneration for collection of taxes) 10 *mā* of land, which he in turn presented for worship to the processional images set up by himself in the temple. In No. 178 from Irumbai in the South Arcot distrcit dated in the 6th year, the king’s name s lost but the title Māravarman is preserved. Since we find only records of Māravarman Vik- rama-Pāṇḍya (Nos. 191 and 192 of 1902) in this temple, this record also may be assigned to him. This inscription registers the gift of salt-pans to the temple of Mākāḷamuḍaiya-Nāyanār in the village by the ,*ūravar* of Villipākkam alias Gaṅgaikoṇḍaśōlanallūr in Ōymā-nāḍu, a subdivision of Jayaṅgoṇḍaśōla-maṇḍalam. Incidentally the record refers to the salt-pans given to the god Tirukkaluk-Kunram-Uḍaiyār, which must refer to the temple at Tirukkalukkunram in the adjacent Chingleput distrcit.

There are two other records of Vikrama-Pāṇḍya (Nos. 211 and 231) without any identifying epithets. They may also be attributed to the same Māravarman, as definite records of this king are mostly found in this district. Of these No. 231 refers to the gift of taxes by the king for conducting a festival in the temple at Tirukkōvalūr on the day of the asterism of his coronation every month. Among these taxes are mentioned two, namely *abhishēkakaikkāṇi* and *tulābhāravari.* It may be noted that another record (No. 166 of 1902) of Māravarman Vikrama Pāṇḍya from Tirumāṇikuli in the same (South Arcot) distrcit refers to the gift of these taxes among others for a Āni. These two taxes are also enumerated in another record from Panayavaram in the same district (No. 437 of 1903) dated in the reign of a Kōnērinmaikoṇḍān, probably a Pāṇḍya king. They were presumably levied for the special expenses connected with the coronation and *tulābhāra* ceremonies performed by kings.

**[*Jaṭāvarman Vikrama-Pāṇḍya.*](cont2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
There are two records of Vikrama-Pāṇḍya (Nos. 216 and 267) with the distinguishing title Jaṭāvarman, dated in the 7th and 8th regnal years and engraved in characters of the 14th century A.D. They come from the same Tirukkoyilur taluk. His inscriptions so far known are few in number and his position in the Pāṇḍya genealogy is still uncertain. He must be, however, distinguished from the king of the same name who was placed on the Madura throne by Kulōttuṅga-Chōḷa III, to whose period the characters of these records cannot be asigned, and a namesake whose 8+14th year corresponded to Śaka 1344, Śubhakṛit (No. 124 of 1908), a Tinnevelly Pāṇḍya whose records are not found as far north as South Arcot. The records attributable to this Jaṭāvarman Vikrama-Pāṇḍya are found at Tiruppukkuli (No. 52 of 1900), Achcharapākkam (No. 245 of 1901), Tiruvāmāttūr (No. 54 of 1922) and Poonamallee (No. 31 of 1911) in the Chingleput district. His highest regnal year so far known is 8. One of his officers was **Śambhukulōttuṅgan Śambhuvarāyan Vīrachampan** (No. 52 of 1900), who also figures in the 12th year of a Māravarman Sundara-Pāṇḍya from Tiruvottūr (Cheyyar taluk of the North Arcot district) (No. 97 of 1900). This Vīrachampa is perhaps identical with his namesake of the Tiruvallam and Conjeeveram inscriptions (Ep. Ind., Vol. III, p. 70), whose date is known to be Śaka 1236 (= A.D.1314). But for want of specific evidence, the identity of this Sundara-Pāṇḍya and his place in the Pāṇḍya genealogy cannot, at present, be established.

**[*Jaṭāvarman Vīra-Pāṇḍya, his title Kaliyugarāman.*](cont2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 42. All the 10 inscriptions attributable to Jaṭāvarman Vīra-Pāṇḍya come from Śrīraṅgam (Nos. 42 to 50 and 98). Of these five (Nos. 43, 44, 47, 48 and 50) give him his full name, while the remaining records have to be assigned to him from internal evidence. Nos. 47 and 49 both dated in the 10t year of the king refer to the foundation of an *agaram* called **Kaliyugarāma-chaturvēdimaṅgalam** after the name of the king by Valaivīśuvān Periyaperumāḷ *alias* Kāliṅgarāyan of Katṭikkurichchi, a hamlet of Parāntakanallūr in Milalai-kūrram, a subdivision of Pāṇḍi-maṇḍalam.
