**THE PANDYAS**

**[*The officer Pallavarayan of TuÃ±jalur.*](cont2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
years corresponded respectively to the cyclic years Pārthiva and Vijaya i.e., in the time of the king of that name whose date of accession was A.D. 1276. In No. 425 of 1911 from Lēpāka in the Cuddapah district dated in the 13th year of a Māravarman Sundara-Pāṇḍya, probably the second of that name whose initial date was A.D. 1238, the chief Pallavarāyan of Tuñjalūr is again mentioned. Thus this officer may be considered to have flourished in the reigns of the four kings Māravarman Sundara-Pāṇḍya II (A.D. 1238), Jaṭāvarman Sundara-Pāṇḍya I (A.D. 1251), Māravarman Kulaśēkhara I (A.D. 1268), Jaṭāvarman Sundara- Pāṇḍya II (A.D. 1276) covering a period from A.D. 1238 to 1287, which though rather long, is not impossible. The *Kōyilolugu,* however, ascribes the construction of this *maṭha* as well as that of Śēran-maṭham and Laṅkēśvaran-maṭham to a certain Paḷḷikoṇḍaśōlan, but in view of the information contained in this record, the statement made in the *Kōyilolugu* has to be set aside as incorrect. Maṇa-vāḷamāmuni, the Vaishṇava *āchārya* of the Tenkalai sect, who flourished early in the 15th century, appears to have stayed at this *maṭha* and to have expounded his teachings. An image of this guru is being worshipped in it and a few mural paintings on its walls depict some incidents in the *āchārya’s* life. It is on this account that this *maṭha* is now called Maṇavāḷamahāmuni-maṭham. It may be mentioned that the *vimāna* and a *maṇḍapa* of the Nammālvār temple at Kapilatīrtham in Tirupati were also constructed by the same chieftain Pallavarāyan *(Tirupati Dēvasthānam Report,* p. 77).

Of the nine records of Jaṭāvarman Sundara-Pāṇḍya without any distinguishing epithets (Nos. 12, 18 to 21, 29, 158, 177 and 209), the majority comes from Śrīraṅgam. From the long Sanskrit inscription engraved on the walls of the Raṅganātha temple here, it can be surmised that Jaṭāvarman Sundara-Pāṇḍya I (accn. A.D. 1251) captured Śrīraṅgam from the Hoysaḷa Sōmēśvara described as ‘ the Moon of the Karṇāṭa family,’ who also probably lost his life in the encounter. Sundara-Pāṇḍya’s lavish benefactions to this temple, justifying the title **Hēmā- Chchhādanarāja** assumed by him and the several *tulābhāra* ceremonies that he conducted here are noticed in the inscriptions copied form this place in previous years. The *Kōyilolugu which* gives the history of this temple contains some additional personal details as to how Sundara-Pāṇḍya wanted to set up an image of himself in the temple and how, on the opposition of the temple authorities to this, he had to content himself with consecrating an image of god Hari ‘ made of gold to the tips of the nails’ and called after his own name of *Hēmāchchhādanarāja or Ponmeynda-Perumāḷ* (Ep. Rep. for 1899, para. 43). This latter image is actually referred to in an inscription (No. 6) of a Tribhuvanachakravartin Sundara-Pāṇḍya without the distinguishing epithet Māravarman or Jaṭāvarman, which, however, on account of the early regnal year 2 in which it is dated, has to be attributed to a king later than Jaṭāvarman Sundara-Pāṇḍya I whose inscriptions dated earlier than the 10th year are not found in this vicinity. Besides this image, Jaṭāvarman Sundara-Pāṇḍya I appears to have installed images under the same name in other temples also, as is evidenced by a record (No. 150 of 1904) from Tiruvēndipuram dated in his 14th year.

**[*Māravarman Kulaśēkhara, A. D. 1268.*](cont2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 40. Maravarman Kulaśēkhara whose date of accession was A.D. 1268 is represented by one inscription from Śrīraṅgam (No. 7) dated in the 10th year. The astronomical details given in it corres- ponded to A.D. 1277, December 6. This record mentions as donor Matituṅgan Tanininruvenra-Perumāḷ *alias* Āryachakra-vartti of Chakravarttinallūr in Śevvirukkai-nāḍu. A chief called Āryachakra- vartti with the title ‘Dēvar’ applied to him figures in the reign of this Pāṇḍya king in the Ramnad district (Nos. 110 of 1903, *Ep. Rep.* for 1927-28, para. 23, and No. 21 of 1929). The Singhalese chronicle *Mahāvaṁsa* says about this chief “that the five brothers who governed the Pāṇḍya kingdom sent to this island, at the head of an army, a great minister of much power who was a chief among the Tamils known as Āriyachakkravartti. And when he landed and laid waste the country on every side, he entered the great and noble fortress, the city of Śubhagiri. And he took the venerable tooth-relic and all the solid wealth that was there and returned to the Pāṇḍyan country.” The chief mentioned in the present inscription is probably to be identified with his namesake noticed in the *Mahāvaṁsa* and the title ‘ Tanininruvenra-Perumāḷ’ applied to him has perhaps some bearing on his exploits in the Singhalese country.

**[*Māṛavarman Vikrama-Pāṇḍya, c. A.D. 1283.*](cont2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 41. Māravarman Vikrama-Pāṇḍya is represented by three inscriptions (Nos. 236, 243 and 268), all of which come from the Tirukkoyilur taluk of the South Arcot district. No. 279 wherein the king is simply called Kōnērinmaikoṇḍān, may
