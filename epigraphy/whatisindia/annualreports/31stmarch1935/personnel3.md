****PERSONNEL.****

The type-script of the *Annual Report* for 1933-34 which was also got ready was sent for the approval of the Director-General of Archæology early in September 1935 before I went on leave, and was received back with his approval at the end of December 1935. It was sent to the press in February 1936 but was not taken up for printing immediately as the *Report* for the previous year was still on hand.
