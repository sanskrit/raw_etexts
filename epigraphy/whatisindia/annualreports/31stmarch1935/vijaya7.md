**THE VIJAYANAGARA KINGS**

He is represented in a standing posture, with cymbals in his hands, signifying his vocation as a songster *(pāṇan).*

**[*A later king named Veṅkaṭa in Śaka 1644.*](cont3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 64. There is another record (C.P. No. 9) of a later Veṅkaṭapatidēvarāya who is stated to have been ruling at Ghanagiri in Śaka 1644, Krōdhin. This refers to a gift of land by Sūrappa-Nāyaka which was transferred by the Nāyaka ruler Vijayaraṅga-Chokkanātha to Mārappa, the son of the donor. It may be noted that this Nāyaka ruler, while issuing some grants in his own name also quotes the name of a Vijayanagara ruler named Veṅkaṭapati in some other records. The allegiance of the later Nāyaka rulers to a Vijayanagara overlord must have been only nominal, and further no genuine records of the latter are found in the Tamil districts. For purposes of reference, a few instances where Vijayaraṅga-Chokkanātha quotes the names of his Vijayanagara overlords are given below.
