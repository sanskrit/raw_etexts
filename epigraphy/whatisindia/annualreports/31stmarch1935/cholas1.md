**[*Parakesarivarman â€˜ who took Tanjai.*](contents3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
34. This dynasty is represented in the collection by 42 inscriptions which come mainly from the South Arcot and the Tanjore districts and range in date from the 9th to the 13th centuries A.D. The earliest of the these is an epigraph on a herostone (No. 51) copied at Vīrachōḷapuram in the Tirukkuoilur taluk (South Arcot) and now kept in the Museum, Madras. It is incised in a peculiar boxheaded variety of early Tamil characters and is dated in the 3rd year of **Parakēsarivarman ‘who took Tanjai,** (Tañjai-koṭṭa=Tañjai-koṇḍa). It may, however, be noted that some Tamil epigraphs from the Punganur taluk belonging to the Rāshṭrakūṭa king Kṛishṇa III have been found to be engraved in box-headed characters also (No. 236 of 1931-1932). The present record has to be assigned to **Vijayālaya,** who is known (from the **Tiruvālaṅgāḍu** plates) to have revived Chōḷa line of kings by taking possession of Tañjāpurī, either directly from the Pallavas or from their feudatories the Muttaraiyans. Several early inscriptions of Parakēsarivarman which have been found in the Tanjore and South Arcot districts have been on good grouns attributed ot Vijayāla. But so far no stone-inscription has been found which couples the conquest of Tanjore with the name Parakēsarivarman. The existence of this inscription in the South Arcot distrcit at this early period is significant as it would indicate the decline of the Pallava power in this region. Vijayālaya’s sphere of rule should in fact have extended even further north into the Toṇḍai-maṇḍalam since a record of Vijayālaya is referred to in this region in an inscription of the later king Vikrama-Chōḷa (No. 164 of 1915). The conquest of Toṇḍai-nāḍu was however completed by Vijayālaya’s son Āditya I (S.I.I. Vol. III, p. 221) who is stated to have defeated Aparājita, the last of the Pallava kings. The present epigraph records the death of a certain Mukkan of Attiyūr in Karpūṇḍi-nāḍu in a cattle-raid. The slab on which the inscription is engraved bears in relief an effigy of this warrior armed with a bow and an arrow. Considering the importance and antiquity of the record, its text and translation are given below (see also plate).

**TRANSALATION.**

In the third year of king **Parakēsarivarman,** who took Ta\[n\]jai when Aṇiyan lifted the cattle, Kalituḍan Mukkan of Karambai, (a hamlet of) Attiyūr, in Karpūṇḍi-nāḍu recovered the herd but died (in the affray).
