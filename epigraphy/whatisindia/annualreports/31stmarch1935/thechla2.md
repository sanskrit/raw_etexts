**THE CHOLAS**

which records a gift to the shrine of Vijayanāyakkar. About a furlong from this place again is a rock in a field bearing an inscription of Rājarāja (III) which mentions **Gaṇḍarādittap-perumbaḷḷi** (No. 448). It is possible that there may have been two shrines in this place one named Gaṇḍarādittap-perumbaḷḷi after the Chōḷa prince Gaṇḍarāditya and the other called Nāṭṭār-perumbaḷḷi evidently founded by the people or assembly of the local *nāḍu* (principality).

**[*Parantaka I.*](cnt2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
30. There are two inscriptions of **Parāntaka I** (Nos. 8 and 443) both dated in the **40th year** of his regin. One of these (No. 443) which is engraved on the side of a steep rock near the top of a hill at Jambai refers to a temple of the Sun-god named Śrī-Gaṇḍarāditya-Ādittagarattudēva which was founded on the top of the Vāḷaiyūr-kunram (hill) in the time of **Uḍaiyār Aiyyanaḍi** and to the gift top it of the income from the village Śirupanaiyūr. The provenance of the inscription suggests that the temple should have existed somewhere close by. It is not clear who the ‘Aiyyanaḍi’ was in whose time the temple was constructed. If we take the expression to mean ‘His Highness the father’ and thus to refer to Parāntaka’s father Āditya I, we have to suppose that the latter also bore the surname Gaṇḍarāditya and that the endowment for worship made in his regin had been somehow in abeyance till the 40th year of his son. From the context of the record, however, it seems more appropriate to apply the term ‘Aiyyanaḍi’ to Parāntaka himself, as the order regulating the expenses of the temple out of this income was issued by an officer named Tennavan Brahmādarājan on the 162nd day of the 4th year, which date can be taken to be only that of Gaṇḍrāditya, the son of Parāntaka, who is known to have taken part in the administration of the country as co-regent with his father after the demise of his elder brother Rājāditya in A.D. 949. It may also be incidentally mentioned here that a certain Tiruvaḍigaḷ Aiyanaḍi of Śiruvēḷur in Vēśālippāḍi figure in the 7th year of a Parakēsarivarman at Kōyil-Tēvarāyanpēṭṭai in the Tanjore district (No. 257 of 1923).

**[*Aditya II.*](cnt2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 31. The next king represented in the collection is Parakēsarivarman ‘who took the head of Vīra-Pāṇḍya’ (i.e. Āditya II), of whom there are two inscriptions both coming from the South Arcot district. They are both dated in his 3rd year (Nos. 380 and 399) and record gifts of land as *ērippaṭṭi* for the maintenance of the local irrigation tanks of the places, one by the king himself in co-operation with the *Ūrār* of Śirupākkam and the other by a certain Oḷikaṇḍan *alias* Śiṅgattaraiyan at Meyyūr in Kurukkai-kūrram, a subdivision of Milāḍu.

**[*Rajaraja I.*](cnt2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 32. Four inscriptions in the collection (Nos. 156 164, 382 and 464) belong to the reign of Rājarāja I. No. 164 which is form Tiruvorriyūr is a fragment dated in the 24th year of Rājarāja and recording an endowment for the daily supply of a flower-garden to the deity by a certain Uḍaiyān Pirāntaka……., who was probably an officer under the king. No. 382 from the South Arcot district dated in the 15th year of Rājarāja introduces a feudatory chief by name **Rāśingapanman** (Rājasiṁhavarman) **Rājarāja-Vāṇakōvariyan.** While he was staying at Tañjāvūr in the college *(kallūri)* to the north of the king’s (?) palace, he is stated to have made a gift of land to a certain Kāḷi Tūduvan alias Paḷḷikkaṭṭilēriya Nāṭṭupēraiyan, probably on the occasion of his succeeding to the headship of the nāḍu.

**[*Rājēndra-Chōḷa I.*](cnt2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 33. **Rajendra-Chōḷa** is represented in the collection by two inscriptions of which No. 157 from Turaiyūr in the Trichinopoly district is dated in his **8th year,** and records an endowment for the maintenance of a Brahman who was to recite the *Śrī-Rudra* during the early morning service of the deity and to teach the Vēdas to scholars during the rest of the day.
