**THE HOYSALAS**

**[*Garuḍavāhana-Bhaṭṭa and the Dhanvantari shrine at Śrīraṅgam.*](cont2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
The village may be identified with Mummuḍiśōla-maṅgalam in the Lalgudi taluk of the Trichinopoly distrcit. The recipient of the gift was a certain **Garuḍavāhana-Bhaṭṭa** who is described as the *rakshaka* of the Hoysaḷa general and who appears to have been conducting a *śāla* even from earlier times. In another inscription (No. 81) engraved on a different slab near this dated in Śaka 1415 (= A. D. 1493), it is mentioned that this *ārōgyaśālā* suffered damage during the *vāṇam* (Muhammadan raid), and that a descendant of this Garuḍavāhana, called Śrīnivāsa and also surnamed Garuḍavāhana, repaired this hospital and installed an image of **Dhanvantri- Emberumān** in it. This rare image of Dhanvantri is still in existence in a shrine in the fourth *prākāra* of the temple. A mutilated image of Dhanvantari kept in the *gōpura* at Chidambaram has been noticed in *Ep. Rep.* for 1935-36, page 94. The earlier Garuḍavāhana is stated to have composed a *prabandham* called *Raṅgaghōshaṇai,* which is not extant now. The Garuḍavāhana figuring in the record of Śaka 1415 may be identified with the author of the *Divyasūricharitam,* a hagiological *kāvya* in Sanskrit narrating the lives of the Vaishṇava Ālvārs and Ācharyas.

A Brahman merchant belonging to the foreign *(paradēśi)* Sāvāsi-vyāpāri community called Sākala-Bhaṭṭa, son of Āhala-Bhaṭṭa of the Sākala-gōtra, figures in No. 70 dated in the 8th year of Rāmanātha as the donor of a flower-garden to god Raṅganātha. The *Sāvāsis* are mentioned in inscriptions of the Bombay Karnātak as having migrated from Kāśmīra, but they do not figure there as merchants.

**[*Two Saiva teachers of his time.*](cont2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 50. As the Hoysaḷa kings generally patronized the Śaiva cult, several Śaiva *maṭha* came into existence during their period. One such *maṭha* existing at Jambukēśvaram is known from No. 125, a record of the 2nd year of Vīra-Rāmanāthadēva which states that **Gautamaśiva-Rāvaḷar,** a disciple’s disciple *(praśishya)* of the great Śaiva teacher Svāmidēva, is said to have purchased a site for building a maṭha at Jambukēśvaram. This Svāmidēva is probably identical with the teacher of the same name figuring in the Ārpākkam record of the 12th year of the reign of Rājādhirāja II (No. 20 of 1899). Another Śaiva *guru* named Tatpurushaśiva of the Lakshādhyāya-santana is mentioned in another Hoysaḷa record in this temple (No. 1 of 1891).
