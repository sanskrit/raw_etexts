****PANDYAS****

by way of remission of taxes. Thereupon it was represented to him that the *tirunāmattukkāṇi* lands at Vēppaṅguḍi which had been granted to the god by the original founder might receive such consideration. Sundara-Pāṇḍya, thereupon, ordered Pilaiporuttān Vālavandaperumāḷ *alias* Sundara-Pāṇḍya-Dānavadaraiyan to treat this land in future as tax-free *kārā nkilamai* of the god. The original founder of this temple, and the chief Sundara-Pāṇḍya-Dānavadaraiyan who is called the *araśu* of Kīramaṅgalam and was probably a close descendant of the former, might both probably be connected with the later chiefs of Arantāṅgi which is also in the same taluk and were possibly their ancestors.

**[Jaṭāvarman Sundara-Pāṇḍya—A.D. 1277.](contents3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 55. There are three records of Jaṭāvarman Sundara-Pāṇḍya in the collection without any distinguishing epithets for the king, which come from Māraṅgiyūr and Chidambaram in the south Arcot district. Of these Nos. 6 and 10 may be assigned to the king whose date of accession was A.D. 1277, since the officers Gāṅgēyarāyar and Kulaśēkhara-Śōlakōnār mentioned in these epigraphs figure also in the reign of Māravarman Vikrama-Pāṇḍya (acc. A.D. 1283) (Nos. 270 and 295 of 1913). From its astronomical details the third (No. 89), may also be assigned to the same king as only his records are found in the South Arcot district.

**[Jaṭāvarman Vīra-Pānḍya-(A.D. 1281).](contents3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
56. There are three inscriptions of Vīra-Pāṇḍya (Nos. 164, 174 and 175), one of which gives him the surname Jaṭāvarman. This inscription (No. 175) is engraved in continuation of another record of the same king. In the date portion of these records, the Śaka year is slightly damaged, but as the first and the last digit 1 and 7 are clear, the Śaka year may be 1207, in which case the astronomical details would correspond to A.D. 1284, August 30. The records therefore belong to Jaṭāvarman Vīra-Pāṇḍya whose initial date was A.D. 1281. No. 174 records an endowment made by a certain Maṇarkuḍāiyān Porpadikkunāyakar Tiruvambalapperumāḷ *alias* Peruñchatura-Kubēran Tiruchchirrambalam-Teḷivuraninaivār of Alagāpuri in Śēliyanārāyaṇapuram for offerings and worship to the images of Tiruvambalapperumāḷ and Dakshiṇāmūrti set up by him in the temple at Tiruppattūr. The document was engraved by Naralōkavīrarāyan and attested by Kulaśēkhara-Mūvēndavēḷān. Besides the two images mentioned above, the donor is stated in No. 175 to have also set up in the same temple, the images of Alagiya Tiruchchirrambalam-uḍaiya-Nāyanar and Tiruvādavur-Nayanar.

The other record of Vīra-Pāṇḍya (No. 164) without the title Jaṭāvarman has also to be attributed to the same king, because of the mention of Kulaśēkhara-Mūvēndavēḷān who has figured above as a signatory in No. 174. This inscription mentions Rājēndrattu-Mudaliyār Śaivaprakāśar, a disciple of Bikshāmaḍattu-Mudaliyār. A *maṭha* called **Salvaprakāśan-tirumaḍam,** in the east street adjoining the temple at Tiruppattūr and presided over by Sarvēśvara, a disciple of the Bhikshā-maṭha is mentioned in another record from Tiruppattūr (No. 173), dated in the 11th year of Tribhuvanachakravartin Kōnērinmaikoṇḍān which we may attribute to the same Jaṭāvarman Vīra-Pāṇḍya because of the mention of Atrayan Tiruvuḍaimaruḍaiyān Tiruvirāmīśvaramuḍaiyān, who is also mentioned in No. 164 above. The origin of this [Bhikshā maṭha](contents3.html#_ftnref1100) is not known, but in later times, its pontiffs called Aghōraśivāchārya and Īśānaśivāchārya are mentioned in inscriptions, which fact suggests their possible connexion with the Śaiva-Siddhānta teachers of the same name. This Bhikshāmaṭha is also mentioned in No. 178 dated in Śaka 1426 in associated with ‘ Gōḷakīdharma,’ and in the 16th century A.D. its disciples had charge of some of the important temples in South India extending from Dēvikāpuram in the North Arcot district (No. 352 of 1912) to Maṇappaḍaivīḍu in the Tinnevelly distrcit (No. 443 of 1909).

**[MaravarmanVikrama-Pāṇḍya (A.D. 1283).](contents3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
57. There are three records of Vikrama-Pāṇḍya in the collection (Nos. 73, 155 and 181) which, on considerations of palaeography may be assigned to **Māravarman Vikrama-Pāṇḍya,** who came to the throne in A.D. 1283. Of these, No. 181 form Tiruppattūr mentions as donor Āḷuḍaiyān Tirumalai alias Tamiladaraiyan of Śaḍaiyanēri in Kalvāyil-nāḍu, while No. 155 states that Nāṇṇi-Uyyavandān, a merchant residing at Jayaṅgoṇḍaśōla-*peruteruvu* set up the goddess Tiruppaḷḷiyēru-Nāchchiyār to the temple at Tiruvīṅgaikkuḍi in Kīlkuṇḍāru, a subdivision of Kēraḷaśiṅga-vaḷanāḍu.
