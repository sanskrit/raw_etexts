****VIJAYANAGARA****

1556, Bhava, where the king is stated to have been ‘ ruling from Penukoṇḍa-paṭṭaṇa’. At the request of his officer *Bhaṇḍāram* Veṅkatapati of the Hāritagōtra, the king presented, along with the hamlet Kāraṇai, the villages Chittūru, renamed Prasanna-Veṅkatāpuram, after purchasing it from Ammāḷāchārya mentioned above, to a number of Vaishṇavas. In the copper-plate of Veṅkata I noticed in the previous paragraph Chittūru is stated to have been given to Ammāḷāchārya along with the hamlet Mūvēndrapattu. Chittūru which had been presented then under the name Raghupatisamudram was now again renamed as Prasanna-Veṅkatāpuram. This Chittūru is probably to be identified with the village of the same name in the Śrīperumbūdūr taluk of the Chingleput district.

74. A later Śrīraṅgarāya ruling from Penukoṇḍa in Śaka 1\[622\] Bahudhānya is mentioned in a record from Vanikuṇta in the Guntur district (No. 241). He may be identical with Śrīraṅga of about A.D. 1692 (Sewell. *List of Antiquities,* Volume II, page 253). This inscription mentions Veṅkatappa- Nāyaniṅgāru, son of Rāyappa-Nāyaniṅgāru and the grandson of Peda- Koṇḍama-Nāyaniṅgāru of Veligōti and of the Rēcherla family; as holding the Vinukoṇḍa-sīma as an *amara-nāyaṅkara* from the king. Rāyappa-Nāyaka is not mentioned in the pedigree given by Sewell *(List of Antiquities,* Volume II, page 240 ff), though an earlier member of this name figures therein *(ibid,* page 241).
