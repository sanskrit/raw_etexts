**THE VIJAYANAGARA KINGS**

51. The Vijayanagara records come mainly from the Trichinopoly and South Arcot districts, while three Telugu records form the Cuddapah district were also copied during the year.

**[*Kampaṇa II.*](cont2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 The earliest member represented is Kampaṇa, whose record (No. 162) dated in Parīdhāvi corresponding to Śaka 1294 (=A.D. 1372-73) comes from Kaṇṇanūr, the quondam capital of the Hoysaḷas in the Trichinopoly distrcit. It states that the temple of Pōsalīśvaram-Uḍaiyār which, we know, had been constructed by Vīra-Sōmēśvara in the middle of the 13th century A.D., was demolished up to the *ādhāraśilai* and converted into a mosque by the Muhammadans during their occuption of this region, and that after Kampana’s conquest of the Muhammadans, the temple was again opened for worship. The *Kōyilolugu* (p. 104) also refers to the fact that the stones of the *prākāra* walls of the Kaṇṇanūr temple had been used by the Muhammadans for constructing fortifications for their garrison.

**[*Śāḷuva-Maṅgu.*](cont2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 52. Of Sāḷuva Maṅgu, the general of Kampaṇa II, there is a record from Villiyanūr dated in the cyclic year Sādhāraṇa, which corresponded to Śaka 1292 (No. 191). He is called Mahāmaṇḍalēśvara Sāḷuva Maṅgudēva-Mahārāja, Tribhu- vanarāya-Gaṇḍaragūḷi, Dakshiṇa-suratrāṇa, Tribhuvanarāya-sthāpanāchārya and **Śambhuvarāya-sthāpanāchārya.** In the record Sāḷuva Maṅgu, makes a grant of 12 *mā* of land to be enjoyed as *tirunāmattukkāṇi* by the temple of Tirukkāmīśva-ramuḍaiya-Nāyanār at Villiyanallūr in Olugaraiparru. How far Sāḷuva-Maṅgu was directly responsible for the establishment of Śambuvarāya is not clear, but we know that Gaṇḍaragūḷi Māraya-Nāyaka, son of Sōmaya-Daṇṇāyaka, captured Venrumaṇkoṇḍa-Śambuvarāya and took Rājagambīranmalai. It is evident that Sāḷuva Maṅgu must have taken part in this campaign, so as to merit the title. The title appears, however, to have been assumed by later members of the Sāḷuva family, namely, Sāḷuva Tirumalaidēva-Mahārāja in Śaka 1370, Prajāpati (wrong) (No. 448 of 1922), and Sāḷuva Saṅgamadēva-Mahārāja in Śaka 1403 (Nos. 593 and 594 of 1902), by virtue of family pride, for the Śambuvarāyas had ceased to exist as a ruling power by this period.
