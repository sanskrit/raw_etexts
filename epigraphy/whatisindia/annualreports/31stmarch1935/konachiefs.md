****KONA CHIEFS****

**[Betraju Malayamuna Gaṇapatidēva.](contents2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
33. There are three inscriptions of the Haihaya of Kōna chiefs in the present year’s collection (Nos. 248, 249 and 250), coming from Kumāradēvam in the Kovvur taluk of the West Godavari district. No. 248 states that in Śaka 1159 Pōli Sēna Ollāsāni daughter of Malli-Nāyaka made a grant of money for the benefit of the temple of Ishṭakāmīśvara-Mahādēva at Gajjara. The second record which bears the Śaka date 1162 refers to Lōkema as the daughter of Kōna-Bētrāju and wife of This Kōna-Bētrāju is not known to us from any other source. His name is not found in the pedigree of the Haihaya-Kōna chiefs given in Ep. Rep. for 1932-1933, p. 58, which was constructed from the records known so far. No. 250 which is a bably damaged inscription bears the **Śaka year 1172 and mentions Malayamuna Gaṇapatidēva.**
