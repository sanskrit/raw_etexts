**THE PANDYAS**

 It is dated in the 5th year and registers a gift of the village Dēviyārēndal to the god Vairava-Nayanār (i.e., Bhairava), whose vehicle, the dog is appro- priately found sculptured on the top of the slab.

**[*Māravarman Parākrama-Pāṇḍya.*](cnt2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 51. **Maravarman Parākrama-Pāṇḍya** is represented by a single inscription (No. 424) from Tiruppālaippandal in the South Arcot district. This incomplete record dated in the 3rd year of the king mentions the Paḷḷis of Muḍiyanūr, and may probably be assigned to the king of that name whose accession took place in A.D. 1335.
