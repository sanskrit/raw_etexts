**MISCELLANEOUS**

[***Pallavas***](cn3.html#_ftnref1100)  
59. There are only two inscriptions of the Pallavas, both from Kāppalūr in the North Arcot district (Nos.277 and 282) and these are mere fragments belonging to Dantivarman and Kampavarman. The record of the latter registers a gift of land by the *sabhā* of Kāmappullūr to a certain Uruppuṭṭūr Narasiṅga-Tiruvēdi, probably as a *bhaṭṭ-vṛitti.*

**[*Parthivendravarman.*](cn3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 60. Parthivēndravarman has two inscriptions in the collection. Of these one found in a temple at Madras (now in the Museum) (No. 306) is dated in his 8th year and records a gift for a lamp to the temple at Tiruchchuram, a hamlet of Nayadhīramaṅgalam in Śurattūr-nāḍu, a subdivision of Puliyūr-kōṭṭam. Judging from the contents, the inscribed stone should have been removed from its place in the temple at Triśūlam near Pallāvaram in the Chingleput district. **‘Nayadhīra’** was the surname of the Pallava king Nandivarman Pallavamalla. The other inscription (No. 238) which is from Kīlachchūr in the North Arcot district, refers to Uttamaśivanāthan, an officer under. **.Śola. .Pṛithvīgaṅgaraiyar** who is stated to have been administering the region up to Kallaḍuppūr, evidently as a **feudatory of Pārthivendra.**

**[*Kannaradeva, â€˜ who look Kachchi and TaÃ±jai â€™.*](cn3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 61. Kannaradēva ‘ who took Kachchi and Tañjai ’, i.e., Kṛishṇa III is represented by 4 inscriptions in the collection (Nos. 242, 269, 272 and 274), all of which are from the North Arcot District and are dated in the 25th and 26th years of his reign. Of these, No. 242 dated in the 26th year in engraved on a slab set up in front of the Gaṇapati shrine at Puduppāḷaiyam and records the construction of the *gōpura* in the temple at Vaśugūr and the consecration
