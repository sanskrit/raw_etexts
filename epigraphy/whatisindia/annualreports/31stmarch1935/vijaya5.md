**THE VIJAYANAGARA KINGS**

of the sellers, which they now sold away with its perquisites in the shape of clothes *(ilakkai),* food, cakes, betel leaves and areca nuts (due during the chanting) of *Tirujñānam, āṭṭaippaḍi, mugampārvai,* etc., to Āṇḍaperumāḷ mentioned above. Among the boundaries of the house, is mentioned the street called Ponnumvāśiyum-koṇḍān-*tiruvidi.*

**[*Oḍḍiyan-galabhai in the South Arcot distrcit.*](cont3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 59. [***Sa*ḷuva Narasiṅgadēva-Mahārāja**](cont2.html#_ftnref1100) is represented by a single inscription (No. 262) dated in Śaka 1393 from Siddhaliṅgamaḍam in the Tirukkoyilur taluk of the South Arcot distrcit. It is a copy of the same record as has been found in several other temples at Tirukkōyilūr, Nerkunram, Jambai, etc., in the same taluk. Apparently copies of the inscription were engraved in all the temples in the region affected by the *Oḍḍiyan-galabhai* or the incursion of the Oḍḍiya king Gajapati of Orissa. The astronomical details in this record, being the same as those in the other copies, are also irregular.

**[*Kṛishṇadēvarāya.*](cont3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 60. Two inscriptions from Jambukēśvaram (Nos. 105 and 107) belong to the reign of **Kṛishṇadēvarāya.** In both of them the officer named **TimmappaNāyaka,** son of Vāśal Mallappa-Nāyaka, is said to have made gifts of lands for the merit of king for the expenses of conducting the second day festival of the *Brahmōtsava* in the temple of Jambunātha. The lands were situated in two villages Tālaikkuḍi in Malai-naḍu, a subdivision of Rājarāja-vaḷanāḍu ‘ on the northen bank’ and Taniyānaiviṭṭān in Uraiyūr-kūrram, a subdivision of Rājagambhīra-vaḷanāḍu ‘on the southern bank’. These subdivision were comprised in the Tiruchchirāppaḷḷi-śīrmai of Chōḷa-maṇḍalam which was in charge of this officer as his *nāyakkattanam.*

**[*An *agrahara* named Krishnarayapuram founded by him.*](cont3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 An incomplete set of copper-plates (No. 10) belonging to the same king comes from the Śrīraṅgam temple, and it is dated in Śaka 1450, corresponding to Sarvajit. The record states that lands in villages called Vēḍambūru and Ēkāmbarapuram ‘on the southern bank of the Kāvērī,’ and the hamlet of Ālaṅguḍi in Tiruvārūr-śīrmai situated in Śuttavallichōḷa-vaḷanāḍu, a subdivision of Śōlamaṇḍalam, were constituted into a new village named Kṛishṇarāyapuram and given to several *brāhmaṇas* for forming an *agrahāra.* It has, however, no connection with the Raṅganātha temple at Śrīraṅgam.

**[*Achyutadevaraya.*](cont3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 61. Two of the records of Achyutadēvarāya (Nos. 182 and 264) dated in Śaka 1454 and coming from Villiyanūr (French India) and Siddhaliṅgamaḍam (Tirukkoyilur taluk) refer to a **Śaruvappayyan,** brother of Rāmābhaṭṭarayyan, who was probably an officer in charge of the locality. This Rāmābhaṭṭarayyan, son of Bhūtanātha Chiṭṭa-Bhaṭṭa, figures in many records as governor of several subdivisions in the time of this Vijayanagara king and of his successor Sadāśiva. In Nos. 368 and 372 which come from the Vayalpad taluk in the Chittoor distrcit, **Veṅkaṭādri-Nāyaka,** son of Mahānāyaṅkarāchārya. Kambham Timmānāyanigāru figures as donor, and he is stated to have obtained the Kandanavōlu-śīma as his *nāyaṁkaram* from the king. He also figures as a donor to the Tirupati temple *(Tirupati Devasthanam Report, p. 233).*

**[*Communal privileges of Kaikkōḷas restored.*](cont3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 No. 201 from Villiyanūr dated in Śaka 146\[4\] is a record of some social interest. It states that the *Ilaivāṇigar* (betel-sellers) claimed certain *birudas* of the *Kaikkōḷas* as belonging to them, and with the connivance of the king’s officers who had been won over by bribes, engraved this document on the *kumudappaḍai* of the temple. The *Kaikkōḷas* and *Dēvāṅga* weavers therefore emigrated from the place in protest. The officers of Tirumalaidēva-Mahārāja named Vijayarāya and others enquired into the matter and after referring to their communal copper-plates deposited at Kāñchīpuram decreed that the *Kaikkōḷas* were entitled to use the *birudas* of Kaṇḍiyadēvan, Kāliṅgarāyan, Paṭṭamānaṅgāttān and Vulagelām-venrān, and had the epigraph substantiating this right engraved on the *kumudappa¬ḍai* of the Tirukkāmiyappar temple. It is of interest to note that many of the communal copperplates and inscriptions in several localities refer to an old original copper-plate *ṥāsanam* deposited in the Kāmakshiamman temple at Kāñchīpuram, whose regulations and decisions the artisan classes all agreed to follow (see also No. 237 of 1902).

**[*Sadasivaraya.*](cont3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 62. Most of the records of Sadāśivarāya come from Śrīraṅgam and they range in date from Śaka 1466 to 1487. No. 11 from the same place which is in Sanskrit verse, is not dated in the reign of any king but belongs to this period only. It. contains
