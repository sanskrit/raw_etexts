****VIJAYANAGARA****

present collection from Tiruppattūr (No. 178) which is dated in Ṡaka 1426, Raktākshi (A.D. 1504, June 28), makes no mention of the ruling king, probably indicating the unsettled condition prevailing in the distant part of the empire, consequent on the death of the actual ruler Narasā-Nāyaka. This inscription mentions the chief **.Tummiśi-Nayaka,** son of Era-Liṅgaya-Nāyaka of Variśai nāḍu, who has a nucber of *birudas* such as *Antembaragaṇḍa, Urigōla-śurattāṇan. Svāmidrōhara-gaṇḍan, Māṇabhūshaṇan,* etc. It is possible that this chief is identical with the Tumbichchi-Nāyaka who rebelled against king Achyuta and was subdued by him about Śaka 1451 in the course of the latter’s expedition to the South (No. 49 of 1900). He presented the village Veḷḷpaḷḷam in Kāraiyūr-śīrmai, a subdivision of Kēraḷaśiṅga-vaḷanāḍu as *maḍappuram* to Īśānśiva who was in charge of the Kallākāramaṭha situated to the south of the temple. The done is said to have belonged to Gāyatrī-gōtra, Yajur-vēda and Bōdhāyana-sūtra and styled *Pāṇḍimaṇḍalādhipati and Pāṇdinaṭṭu-Mudaliyār* (No. 178). He belonged to the lineage of Bhikshā-maṭha *alias* Lakshādhyāyi and of the Gōḷakī-dharma. Besides the Kallākāra-maṭha mentioned above, he presided also over the *Arubttumūvantirumadām* at Tirrukkoḍuṅgunram i.e. Pirānmalai (No. 213 of 1924).

**[*Kṛishṇadēvaraya.*](contents4.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 67. **Kṛishṇadēvaraya-Maharaya** is represented by two records from Pōṭladurti (Cuddapah district) and Tiruppattūr (Ramnad district) dated in Śaka 1435 and 1440 respectively (Nos. 334 and 177). One of these (No. 334) mentions Rāchirāja, son of Mahāmaṇḍaḷēśvara Eraguḍi Gaḍḍamayyadēva-Mahārāja as a subordinate of the king, who received from the king the village Pōṭladurti for Juṭlu-kolpu A certain Rāchirāja Basuvayya is mentioned in a record from Pālagiri in the same district dated in Ṡaka 1442 (No. 320). Rāchirāja Eram-Timmaya, probably an earlier member of the family, figures in the time of **Immaḍi-Narasiṅgaraya-Maharaya** in Śaka 1426 (No. 321). The other inscription (No. 177). records an endowment by Timmappar alias Veṅgaḷa-Nāyaka, son of Kṛishṇarāja of Chinnappaṭṭu for the merit of Ṡellappar *alias* Vīranarasiṁharāya-Nāyaka who has the *biruda* ‘ Kāñchīpuravarādhīśvara.’ It is known from other records that he was the son of Taluvakkulaindān-Bhaṭṭa of Kañchī (No. 487 of 1920). The donor Timmappa mentioned above has the titles *Kaṭaka-Nārāyaṇan Hattu-mūvarāya-gaṇḍan, Hannibbara-gaṇḍan and Daṇḍō \[bara\]-gaṇḍan* and in another record from the same place (No. 91 of 1908) he gets the additional titles *Vairigaja-bhīman, Pāṭagajaputran and Taṭati-Nārāyaṇan.* His son was Śiṅgama-Nāyaka who figures in a record from Tiruppattūr dated in Śaka 1432, Pramōdūta *(ibid).*

**[*Achyutadeva-Maharaya.*](contents4.html#_ftnref1100)**  
68. Of the seven records of Achyutadēva-Mahārāya (Nos. 98, 179, 2, 272, 335, 325 and 303), No. 98 from Māraṅgiyūr, dated in Śaka 1445 (mistake for 1453) mentions a gift by Aṭṭavaṇai Vasavaraśaiyyan Gōvindayyar (i.e. Gōvindayyar, son of Vasavarasaiyyan) the *Mahāpradhāni* of the Tiruvadigai-rājya. This Vasavarasayyan seems to be distinct form Vasavayya-Nāyaka of No. 179 from Tiruppattūr dated in Śaka 1460, who bears the epithet *Svāmadrōhara-gaṇḍa.* The latter’s son Periya Rāmappa-Nāyaka figures as donor in this record. This Rāmappa is known to have been an agent of the king in the southern districts of Ramnad (No. 30 of 1928 ; No. 217 of 1924 ; No. 222 of 1924 ; and No. 33 of 1929) and Tinnevelly (No. 373 of 1916). A record from the Coimbatore district (No. 245 of 1913) mentions Rāmappa as having “ borne the burden of the kingdom with the king”. A different Rāmappa was the son of *Sthānapati* Bācharasayya who held Guddalūru-sīma as *Nāyaṅkara* from king Achyuta in Śaka 1455 (No. 272).

**[*82 villages granted to the temple at Chidambaram.*](contents4.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 No. 2 dated in Śaka 1451 from Chidambaram gives the names of 82 villages, the income from which amounting to *3,000 pon* had been originally allotted by Kṛishṇarāya-Nāyaka for the expenses of the car and other festivals and for repairs to the temple at Perumbarrappuliyūr, and which was now re-endowed by the king at the instance of Sāḷuva-Daṇāyaka. This Kṛishṇarāya-Nāyaka, who was evidently an officer of the king figures two years later in a record from the Śalem distrcit (No. 265 of 1913).
