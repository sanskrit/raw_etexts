**THE GANDAGOPALAS**

**[*Vijaya-Gaṇḍagopala.*](cnt2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
54. From Āvilāla in the Chittoor district comes a record (No.187 ) of Tribhuvanachakravartin **Vijaya-Gaṇḍgōpāladēva** dated in the 18th year. It is highly damaged and some of the inscribed slabs are also missing. The inscription refers to the Sivaliṅga-chalana, probably the loosening of the *liṅga,* in the *Sanctum* of the temple of Kavilīśvaramuḍaiya-Nāyanār at Āvilāli, The *nāḍu* (district assembly) brought this fact to the notice of the *Māhēśvaras* of the Tirukkāḷatti-udaiya- Nāyanār temple and got the liṅga reconsecrated after obtaining the necessary *śattimugam, tirumugam and sādhanam* from the authorities. Since the inscription is amaged fuller details are not available.

 Vijaya-Gaṇḍagōpāla’s initial date is fixed as A. D. 1250 by a record from Conjeevaram (No. 27 of 1890) which equates his 16th year with Śaka1187, and his latest regnal year so far known is 32 (No.137 of 1916) . Vijaya-Gaṇḍagōpāla ruled as an independent chief with the title ‘Tribhuvanachakravartin’ and issued records in his own name. During this period (i.e., 1250 -1281 A. D.), the Chōḷas under Rājēndra-Chōḷa III had lost their hold on Toṇḍai-maṇḍalam, as can be inferred from the absence of his inscriptions in this region. Vijaya-Gaṇḍagōpāla and Kōpperuñjiṅga shared this territory between themselves the former taking the northern half and the latter the southern. That Rājēndra-Chōḷa had lost this region is also inferable from record from Tirukkachchūr (N0.314 of 1909) in the Chingleput district which refers to Kulōttuṅga-Chōḷa (III), Rājarāja (III), and Jaṭāvarman Sundara-Pāṇḍya (I) as the successive rulers of the region, leaving out the name of Rājēndra-Chōḷa III.
