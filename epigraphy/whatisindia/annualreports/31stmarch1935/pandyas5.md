**[Origin of the Rajanarayanapuram branch of the Nagarattar community.](contents3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
No. 150 from Piḷḷaiyārpatti in the Ramnad district, dated in the 11th year of Tribhuvanachakravartin Konērinmaikoṇḍān who is probably identical with Māravarman Sundara-Pāṇḍya, men tions that the *nagarattār* ( mercantile colony) settled in *Aiññūrruvap perunteruvu* in Eṇkārikkuḍi, purchased some land at Marudaṅguḍi for founding a new colony called Rājanārāyaṇapuram. It is of interest to note that Rājanārāyaṇapuram is the name of one of the 9 places from where that present Nāṭṭukōṭṭai-Cheṭṭis colonised in the Pāṇḍya country and the present record gives the approximate date of their colonisation as the first quarter of the 13th century A.D. Thurston in his ‘Castes and Tribes of Southern India ‘(Vol. V., p. 260) records the Nāttukōttai-Chetti tradition that about Kali 3808 a Pāṇḍya king named Sundara-pāṇḍya asked the Chōḷa king to induce some of the Vaiśyas to settle down in the Pāṇḍya country. They accordingly emigrated in a body and reached the village of Oṇkārakkuḍi on a Friday. They were allowed to settle in the tract of country north of the river Vaigai, east of Pi ānmalai and south of Veḷḷār. If the Eṇkārikkuḍi colonisation is synchronous with the one at Rājanārāyaṇapuram, the present inscription may be said to confirm the tradition noted above though it ante dates the event by over six centuries.

**[Reference to the Hoysaḷa invasion in his time.](contents3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
Reference to a Hoysaḷa invasion of the Tamil country is made in a record of Māravarman Śundara-Pāṇḍya I, dated in the 20 + 1+ 1st year from Tiruppattūr (No. 170). This inscription states that, during the confusion following this invasion, Ulaichchāṇan Vishṇu Padmanābhan, Bālāśriyan Śaṅkaranārāyaṇan and others broke into the temple-treasury and stole away the money therefrom. They were also found guilty of killing Brahmans, for which their lands were confiscated and sold to the temple of Tiruttaḷiyāṇḍa-Nāyanār by the **Mūlaparishad-Mahasabha** of Tiruppattūr. The date of this record may have corresponded to A .D. 1239, when the contemporary monarch on the Hoysaḷa throne was Vīra-Sōmēśvara (A.D. 1232-61). In some of the his inscriptions Sōmēśvara styles himself ‘the Uprooter of the Pāṇḍya’ and in others ‘the Elevator of the Pāṇḍya race’. Sōmēśvara was hostile to the Pāṇḍyas and later became their friend and relation, as can be seen from the epithet *māmaḍigaḷ,* applied to him in the records of Māravarman Sundara-Pāṇḍya I \[. The Hoysaḷas under Vīra Narasiṁha entered the Tamil country as allies of the Chōḷa king Rājarāja III during the latter’s struggle with Kōpporuñjiṅgadēva. In this encounter the Pāṇḍyas also were involved and thus they came into conflict with the Hoysaḷas. We know that, after establishing Rājarāja III on the Chōḷa throne ,Vīra Narasiṁha himself marched to Śrīraṅgam to prevent the Pāṇḍyas from invading the Chōḷa country and that he even set up a pillar of victory at Sētu in memory of his *digvijaya (Ep. Carn. Vol. V, Ak. 123).* There was thus good reason for confusion in the land, as stated in the present inscription.
