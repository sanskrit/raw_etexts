**MISCELLANEOUS**

another inscription from Śrīraṅgam (No. 62) dated in Śaka 1393 without specifying the king’s king name refers to a garden called ‘Mahāpātram-tōppu’, evidently reminiscent of the sojourn of this king (Hambīra) at Śrīraṅgam.

**[*Prataparudradeva.*](cn3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 The copper-plate grant of Pratāparudra (C.P. No. 7) was received from Mr. B. Ramachandra Reddi of Buchchireḍḍipāḷem in the Nellore district. It is stated to have been discovered while digging a field at Duvvūru in the Kovur taluk of the same district. Another copper-plate grant of the king dated in Śaka 1432, Pramōda, found in the same district has been noticed in the *Epigraphical Report* for 1921, para. 70. The present grant is dated in Śaka 1223 expressed by the chronogram *guṇalōchanārka* which is, however, evidently a mistake for Śaka 1443. The wording of the grant is also very faulty and the sense in several place obscure, and hence it raises a suspicion about its genuine- ness. The king is here called ‘ the lord of Kalabaragadēśa (Gulbarga) and of the Kannaḍa of Karnāṭa ’. He claims to belong to the Ikshvāku family of the Solar race in which was born king **Kapilēśa.** His son was **Purushōttama** and the latter’s son was **Pratāparudra,** the donor of the grant. The king is stated to have halted at Saṅgamēśvara in the course of his *dig-jaitra-yatrā,* and after bathing in the river Pinākinī, to have granted an *agrahāra* formed to the north of the Paiḍipāḍu village and called Rājamāmbāpuram to two Brahmans, Nārāyaṇa and Nannaya of the Śrīvatsa-gōtra.

**[*Keḷadi chief, Sōmaśēkhara.*](cn3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 65. A copper-plate grant belonging to the Keḷadi dynasty was received from the District Munsif of Kundāpūr in the South Kanara district (C.P. No. 1). It is dated in Śaka 1596 and records an order by Chennemmāji, the wife of Sōmaśēkhara-Nāyaka, making a gift of all the income from the villages Sēnāpura and Beḷagrāma in Halasa-nāḍu for the expenses of worship in the temple of Veṅkaṭēśkhara at Gaṅguvaḷi in Muguvina-sīme. Sōmāśēkhara is believe to have lived on till Śaka 1599 (1677 A.D.), though the administration of the principality was carried on by his queen Chennammāji, even during his life time *(Vij. Sexcent. Com. Vol., p. 265).*

**[*Achyutappa-Nayaka of Tanjore*](cn3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 66. A record of the Tanjore Nāyaka chief Achyutappa-Nāyaka, son of Śevvappa, dated in the cyclic year Prabhava was copied this year at Śrīraṅgam (No. 104). It describes the ten *avatāras* of Vishṇu and records the provision made by the chief by an endowment of money for lamps and offerings in the temple of Raṅganātha.

**[*Madura Nāyaka chief Muddaḷakadri.*](cn3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 67. There are two records of the Madura Nāyaka chief Muddaḷa kādri (Mudduliṅga-Nāyaka) in the collection (Nos. 27 and 31) copied from Srīraṅgam, of which No. 31, dated in Śaka 1602, Siddhārthin, records a gift of a *kāñchuka* (vest) inlaid with precious stones for God Raṅganātha. From a copper-plate record of this chief *(Mys. Arch. Report* for 1917, para. 138), it is known that he was at Srīraṅgam in the month of Vaiśākha of the year Siddhārthin, when he made a gift of a village in the Srīvaikuntam taluk of the Tinnevelly district, to the teacher Yōgīndratīrtha Srīpāda-Oḍeyar. In the other record (No. 27) which gives a list of his other benefactions to the temple such as ornaments and provi- sion for offerings and worship, a certain teacher of his is mentioned by the appellation **Āchārya Vādhūla-Chūḍāmaṇi.** These two records do not give the name of any overlord, but a copper-plate of his dated in Śaka 1600, Kāḷayukti noticed by Sewell *(List of Antiquities,* Vol. II, No. 20), is dated in the reign of Śrī Raṅgarāya-Mahādevaraja.

**[*Queen Minakshi.*](cn3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 The latest inscription of this dynasty in the year’s collection is a single Copper-plate grant (C.P. No. 18), a photograph of which was taken with the permission of the Madras High Court where it was kept in deposit in connection with some civil suit. It is dated in Śaka 1655, Pramādicha and refers itself to the reign of Veṅkaṭadēva-Māhārāya ‘ ruling at Ghanagiri’. This inscription records the grant of the village Samayavaram (near Trichinopoly) by queen Mīnākshī to a certain **Ramudulla-Sāyabu.** Sewell in his *List Antiquities,* Vol. I, p. 267, refers to two grants made by this queen in the same year, one in Hindustani and the other in Tamil. The present one is evidently a different
