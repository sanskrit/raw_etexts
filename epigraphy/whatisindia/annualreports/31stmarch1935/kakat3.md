**THE KAKATIYAS**

the records of Rudradēva dated in Śaka 1192 and 1193 (Nos. 246 and 188 of 1905), and it is not known in what way he was connected with the Uttama-śiva figuring in No. 307 of Śaka 1193 mentioned above. It is worth noticing here that though Viśvēśvara was the first *dīkshā-guru* of the Kākatīyas, the teachers of the Gōḷakī- maṭha appear to have moved to South India sometimes early, and commanded considerable influence in the Telugu country at least the time of his teacher Dharma-śiva, pupil of Vimala-śiva, who is stated to have built a *maṭha* at Tripurāntakam in Śaka 1169 (No. 253 of 1905).

 The spiritual lineage of the Gōḷakī-maṭha in the Telugu country before and after Viśvēśvara may thus be set forth in the following table with known Śaka dates for themâ€”

Vimala-śiva  
Dharma-śiva, Śaka 1169.  
Viśvēśvara-śiva called Rājagurudēva  
(Śaka 1149 (?) , 1165, 1174, 1190 and 1193)  

Paripurṇa-śiva Śantaśambhu or Śānta-śiva
Uttama-dēva  
(Śaka 1165 and 1174) (Śaka 1179 and 1185)(Śaka 1193)  
Srikantha-siva (Saka 1192 and 1193).
