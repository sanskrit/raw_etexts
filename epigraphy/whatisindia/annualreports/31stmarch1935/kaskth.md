**THE KAKATIYAS**

**[*Gaṇapatidēva.*](cnt3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
56. Of this dynasty the earliest record in the collection is No. 233, which comes from Gaṅgavaram in the Cuddapah district and belongs to **Gaṇapatidēva.** This inscription dated in Śaka 1179, Piṅgala, corresponding to A. D. 1257, calls the king ‘a worshipper of Svayambhudēva’, and gives him the usual titles *Chalamartigaṇḍa Mūrurāya-jagadāḷa and Rāyagajakēsari.* It registers a gift of the village Gaṅgāpuram in Muliki-nāṇḍu by the king’s subordinate **Gaṇḍa- peṇḍāra Gaṇgaya-Sāhiṇi** of the Kāyastha family and his wife Kamalādēvī, for the worship of god Pushpēśvara-Mahādēva at Pushpagiri near Gaṅgavaram. This gift was entrusted to a certain **Īśānagurudēva** who was probably a Śaivāchārya attached to a branch of the Gōḷakī-maṭha situated in this locality. The same officer again figures in another record from Poḍadurti (No. 269) dated in Śaka 1178, Naḷa, wherein he is stated to have renewed a grant of land made formerly to the temple of Mūlasthānadēva at Poḍatolta.

**[*Rudrakumara (Prataparudra).*](cnt3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 57. The next Kākatīya record (No.321) belongs to **Rudrakumāra** (Pratāpa- rudra) and is dated in Śaka 1212, Vikṛiti (A.D.1290). It comes from Malyāla in the Kurnool district and registers the establishment of a *matha* at Malyāla by **Sarvēśvarayyagṁāru,** who endowed it with lands which he had obtained from Rudradēva, the son of Mahāsāmanta Cheraku Bollaya-Reḍḍi. He entrusted them to Mahādēva, the son of his elder brother Sadāśivayyaṁgāru. The *Bālabhāgavatamu* of Dōnūri Kōnērināthakavi contains a reference to Cheruku Rāchanarēndra who was defeated by Tāta Pinnama of the Āravīṭi family *(Bhārati,* Vol. VI, Part I, p. 848), who was thenceforth called *Cheruku-Rācha- Nayaka-saptāṅga-haraṇa (Rāmarājīyamu* of Somadēva : *Sources of vijayanagara History,* P.79). Sarvēśvarayya mentioned above seems to have been an influential person in the time of the Kākatīya ruler Rudrāmbā. He is introduced with the eulogy *‘Svasti samasta-praśasti-sahita*’ etc., which is used ordinarily in the case of chieftains. In no. 322 he is stated to have constructed the Śiva temple at Malyāla and to have consecrated the gods Sarvēśvara and Bollēśvara, named respectively after himself and the above-noted chief Bollayya-Reḍḍi who was the son of Cheraku Peda-Dēvaya, In Śaka 1213, Khara, he also made provision for the maintenance of lamps in the temple mentioned above (No.323). Besides these religious institutions, he had also founded a feeding house *(satra)* at Alampura in Śaka 1208, which he maintained from the lands obtained from Brahmarājamayyaldēva and other chieftains (No.320).

 No. 352, is a fragmentary record belonging to Pratāparudra dated in Śaka 1214. It comes from Uṇḍavalli and seems to record some endowment made to god Anantaśayanadēva for the merit of the king.
