**THE EASTERN CHALUKYAS**

of the records and the legend ‘Srī-Tribhuvanāṅkuśa’ engraved on the seal of the grant make it assignable to **Vijayāditya II** (Narēndramṛigarāja ; Śaka 716-764) of whom another copper plate grant was also secured in 1917 from the Same district (C. P. No. 5 of 1916-17). It records a grant of land sowable with paddy at Maṅgavēḍugrāma in Gudravāra-*vishaya* to the Vedic scholar Yajñaśarman, son of Bandhuśarman and grandson of Kuppaśarman of the Bhārad vāja-*gōtra,* who was a resident of Krōvaśiri. The executor *(ājñapti)* of this grant is said to be Paṇḍaraṅga, ‘ the bee at the lotus-feet of Guṇagāṅka-vajayāditya’. These two persons are identical with the famous general **Paṇḍaraṅga and his master Guṇaga-Vijayāditya III,** the grandson of the king. The gift-village is probably identical with Maṅginapūḍi in the Bandar taluk of the Kistna district. The village Krōvaśiri mentioned in the records is evidently the same as the modern village Krōsūru of the Sattenapalle taluk, Guntur district.

**[*Vijayaditya III.*](cn.html#_ftnref1100) **  
5. To Vijayāditya III belongs a grant found this year, which like the later grants of the family, gives elaborate information about the ancestors of the king and the periods of their rule. (C. P. No. 3). We learn from it that the king’s mother was Sĩlakāmbā, the daughter of a certain Chandrarāja. The Pōnaṅgy plates of Guṇaga-Vijayāditya mention Śīlāmbikā as a Rāshṭrakūṭa princess *(Ep. Rep.* for 1909, p. 56) and hence this **Chandrarāja should have been a member of the Rāshṭrakūta family** though his identity is not clear. The records states that the king. ‘having achieved all his ambitions in the world, turned his attention to Dharma’, thus indicating that the grant should have been issued late in his reign. It records the gift of the village Kāṭlaparru in the Vēṅgi-sahasra-vishaya by the king to his Brahman general Rājāditya who distinguished himself in the king’s wars by his valour and won for him enor- mous wealth from the enemy kings. This Rājāditya’s son was Peddana who was equally famous and powerful and was greatly attached to the king by ties of loyalty. We also get an account of the donee’s ancestors in the record. His great grandfather was Kumāramūrti who came of a line of great scholars, who was the master of the villages Kaṭūru and Vāyalūru, evidently identical with the present villages of the same name in the Chingleput district, and who was held in great esteem in his locality. Unwilling to submit to the insolent treatment of the then Toṇḍaimān king Kāḍuveṭṭi, this high-spirited Brahman migrated to the Vēṅgi country and settled at Uṇḍi. His son was Viddiśarman of spotless character whose son was Kumāra *alias* Peddana. This Peddana married Chānamāmbā and to them was born Rājāditya the donee of the present grant. It is to be noted that this grant gives the earliest epigraphical reference to the village Uṇḍi.

**[*Bādapa.*](cn.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 6. An interesting record of Bādapa (C. P. No. 6) was secured from Arumbāka in the Repalle taluk of the Guntur district, wherefrom another grant of the same king was also obtained in 1920-21, and has been published in *Epigraphia Indica* Vol. XIX, pp. 137 ff. The political events narrated in the latter vary slightly from those found in the present plates, While giving the account of each king the present inscription mentions against Guṇaka-Vijayāditya that he killed in battle the Noḷamba King Maṅgi and overthrew Saṅkila and Ugra-Vallabha. Maṅgi and Saṅkila are already known from C. P. No. 15 of 1981 and that **Maṅgi was a Noḷamba chief** is known from the present grant as well as the Maliyapūṇḍi grant of Amma I *(Ep. Ind.* VOL. IX, pp. 47ff). In place of Ugra-Vallabha, the other grant mentions Baddiga. After his brother’s great-grandson Amma I ruled for 7 years, the latter’s young son Chāḷukya-Bhīma (I) was superseded by Tāla, son of Yuddhamalla of the collateral line, who ruled for 1 month. The Arumbāka grant mentions in place of this Chāḷukya-Bhīma, his elder brother Vijayāditya. Tāla, according to the present record was killed by the powerful Vikramāditya who ruled for one year, though he is stated in the other Arumbāka grant to have been defeated. After Vikramāditya came a period of confusion for 5 years, when three dāyāda princes Yuddhamalla, Rājamārttāṇḍa and Kaṇṭhikā-Vijayāditya with their supporters, each bent on securing the kingdom for himself, were fighting with each other, oppressing the subjects. Of these Rājamārttāṇḍa, was killed and the other two were driven away from the kingdom by Rāja-Bhīma, i.e., Chāḷukya-Bhīma II, son of Vijayā ditya who restored order and ruled the kingdom for 12 years.
