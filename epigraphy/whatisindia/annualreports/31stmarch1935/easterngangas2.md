****EASTERN GANGAS****

13\. From the indifferent wording and the script adopted and also from the definitely worded date of the record, it may be assigned to the period to which Chicacole plates of Satyavarman, son of Dēvēndravarman, dated in the Gāṅgēya year 351 belongs *(Ep. Ind.* Vol, V, App. No. 684). Our record dated in the Gaṅga year 358 would come seven years after Śatyavarman’s grant and it is reasonable to infer that Anantavarman, the king of the present record who was  
[A provisional genealogy of the Eastern Gangas.](contents2.html#_ftnref1100)  
also a son of Mahārāja Dēvēndra varman, was younger brother of Satyavarman. The genealogy would then tentatively stand thus :â€”

                  Devendravarman  
SatyavarmanGanga     Anantavarman Ganga   
year 351; (Kielhorn's Ganga year 358; (present grant)  
Northern List, No. 684  
We have already got a line of kings for the period immediately preceeding Satyavarman noticed in the table of p. 137 of the *Ep.* Rep. for 1918, Viz

Maharaja Rajendravarman I  
Maharaja Anantavarman  
(Ganga Year)  
Maharaja Rajendravarman II  
(Gange year 342)

Provisionally assuming that Rājēndravarman I was the son and successor of Dēvēndravarman of the Chicacole plates of the Gāṅgēya year 51 (Kielhorn’s *Northern List,* No. 682) which on palӕographical and genealogical grounds I would assign to the 251st year (See also Bhandarkar’s *List of Northern Inscriptions,* No. 1480) and consequently identify its king with the Dēvēndravarman of the 254th year of the Gāṅgēya era *(ibid* No. 681) and for similar reasons also assuming that Dēvēndravarman, the father of Satyavarman was a younger brother of Anantavarman of the 304th year, the genealogy for these kings may provisionally be reconstructed as given below. The correctness of it will however depend upon future discoveries.
