**THE WESTERN CHALUKYAS**

The Mālēpāḍu plates and the Rāmēśvaram stone inscription (No. 384 of 1904) are both dated in his own 5th regnal year, and so Puṇyakumāra must have assumed independence at this time *(Ep. Ind.,* Vol. XI, p. 342). The latter record mentions the name of the āṇatti of the grant as Mārpiḍugu-Raṭṭaguḍlu. ‘Mārpiḍugu’ was a well-known title in the time of the Pallava king Dantivarman.

**[*Nūrmaḍi-Taila.*](cnt.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 16. Of the Chāḷukyas of Kalyāṇa, the first king **Nūrmaḍi-Taila** (A. D. 973 to 997) figures in a record(No. 307) from Gollapalle in the Jammalamadugu taluk of the Cuddapah district, and he is stated to have made a gift of land to a spiritual teacher named **Nāgarāśi-Paṇḍita** for worship and offerings to the god in a temple *(dēva-sthāna)* whose name is not specified, situated to the north of Musalimarruru.\*

**[*Bhuvanaikamalla (Somesvara II).*](cnt.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 17. A record from Erramaṭham in the Kurnool district (No. 317) belongs to the regin of **Bhuvanaikamalla** (Sōmēśvara II) and was issued on the day of a lunar eclipse in the month of Chaitra in Śaka 997, Rākshasa, corresponding to A. D. 1075, April. The king was staying in his *nelevīḍu* at Baṅkāpura at the time of this order. His subordinate named Mahāmaṇḍalēśvara Satyarasa is said to have made an endowment for the conduct of worship to *god Bikkēśvaradēva* installed in the Eḍeya-maṭha in the name of his father *Bikke-ārasa,* evidently at this village. The present name Erramaṭham of the village is clearly derivable from the original name of the *maṭha, viz.,* the Eḍeya-maṭha. The feudatory **Satyarasa** bears a number of *birudas* such as ‘ṭagarapura-paramēśvara’, ‘Svarṇagaruḍadhvaja’, ‘Pratyaksha-Jīmūtavāhana-kula-sambhava’, etc., and is said to have been a disciple of a certain Mallikārjunadēva. The title ‘Tagarapura-paramēśvara’, *i.e.,* the lord of Tagarapura’ as well as the family of the chieftain which is mentioned as Jīmūtavāhana-kula indicates that he belonged to the Khachara family, a stock of the Śilāhāras, several members of which have figured in other Chāḷukya records of the period (Fleet’s Dyn. Kan. Dist., p. 439). Their banner was also one of the golden Garuḍa *(Svarṇa-garuḍa-dhvaja).* There are a few other records of the Chāḷukyas in the year’s collection which are however much damaged. In No. 308 the name of \[Tribhu\]vanamalladēva is alone decipherable, while No. 192 mentions a Satyāśraya.
