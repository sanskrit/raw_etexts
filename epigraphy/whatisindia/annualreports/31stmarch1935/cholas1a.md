35. Next in point of time is a record of the 5th year of Rājakēsarivarman (No. 52) incised in almost the same kind of script as that of Parakēsari mentioned above. It should therefore be ascribed to Āditya I. It states that Lāḍavaraiyan Araiyaṇ Kōnariaraiyan, a resident of Śerupparai in Vilaiyūrnādu, dug a tank (in this village) and endowed land for its upkeep. To the same king may be assigned No. 62 of the collection which is also in early, but not box-headed, characters and which is dated in the 24th year of Rājakēsari. There was no king of this name with this high regnal year before Rājarāja I except Āditya I. This record also states that a tank was dug in the village and a land endowed for its maintenance and for keeping its sluice in proper condition by a certain Ariñjigai Vēmban of Paralūr in Uḍaikkāḍu-nāḍu. The name of this donor would lead one to connect the inscription with Ariñjaya, the son of Parāntaka I, but the date of the record is against it. It reads as follows :â€”

**TRANSLATION.**

Hail ! Prosperity !

In the twenty-fourth year of king Rājakēsarivarman, I, Ariñjigai Vēmban, (the chief) of Paralūr in Uḍaikkāḍu-nāḍu, who dug a new tank, made a gift of a quarter *śey* (of land), and (one) *kuruṇi* of paddy per *mā* (of land), for repair to the new tank and for providing a sluice to it.

 The feet of him who protects this charity shall be on my head. He who annuls this shall enter the hell more infernal than the seventh hell.

**[*Rajaraja I.*](contents3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 36. An inscription of Rājakēsarivarman (evidently Rājarāja I) from the same place (No. 63) which is dated in the 3rd year of the king is in slightly later characters. It records the gift of a village. . . .tēmāri in Ilāḍaippāḍi Koḍuṅgālūr-nāḍu as a *śridhana (stridhana)* by a chief named Ilāḍarāyar Kanamalan Nambāli to his daughter Kōṇi-Naṅgai on the occasion of her marriage with a Bāṇa chief named Vāṇakōvaraiyan Toṅgal-Maravan *alias* Mummuḍiśō\[la-Vā\]ṇakōvaraiyan. Ilāḍaippāḍi is the name given in inscriptions to Māraṅgiyūr, a village close to Paranūr. Hence the gift-village should be near the present Paranūr. The document is said to be executed by a certain Nambāli Sundaraśōlan. The surname of the donee’s husband suggests that he might have been a feudatory of Mummaḍi-Chōḷa, i.e., Rājarāja I. Of Rājarāja I there are six other inscriptions in the collection ranging from his 13th regnal year to the 27th. Of these, a record of his 15th year from Paranūr (No. 66) mentions a certain Vēmban Sundaraśōlan *alias* Māvali Vayirapōśan *alias* Vāṇarājan, who is stated to have been the chief of Udaikkādu-nāḍu, evidently as a feudatory chief under the king. From No. 161 we learn that a certain Kāḍan Śrīyārūrdēvan of Mukundanūr who was a *Perundaram* (superior officer) of Rājarāja enjoyed as his jīvita the ḍivision of Tennārruppōkku in Pāṇḍi-nāḍu *alias* Rājarāja-vaḷanāḍu in which Kunrakkuḍi was situated.

 **[*37. Rājēndra-Chōḷa I*](contents3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
is represented by five inscriptions in the collection. Nos. 65 and 67 from Paranūr dated in his 5th and 3rd years respectively record gift of some lands as *dēvadāna* after reclamation by a certain Vāṇarāyan Aṇṇāmalai Karpakam *alias* Vāṇādarāyan of Paralūr in Uḍaikkāḍu-nāḍu. The donor might be of the same family as the Vāṇarājan mentioned above as the chief of Uḍaikkāḍu.
