**THE CHOLAS**

As most of the signatories at the end of these records also figure in inscriptions of Rājēndra-Chōḷa III, it may be supposed that they refer themselves to the reign of this king only. They record also a remission of taxes on 25 *vēli* of lands granted as *dēvadāna* in Muṭṭam *alias* Villavanallūr in Nittavinōda-vaḷanāḍu by Tripurādēvī, the king’s aunt *(attai).* From her name this lady appears to have belonged to the Hoysaḷa royal house.
