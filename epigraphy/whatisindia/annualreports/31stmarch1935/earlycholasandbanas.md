****EARLY CHOLAS AND BANAS****

20.The epigraphical survey of the Vinukonda taluk of the Guntur district and of a few villages in the Cuddapah, Kurnool and West Godavari districts has yielded a representative collection of stone inscriptions belonging to the Chōla, Bāṇa and other dynasties.

**[*Chola-Maharaja*](contents2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
  The earliest among these are the two epigraphs of Chōla-Mahārāja (Nos. 310 and 330) secured at Indukūr and Uruṭūr of the Kamalapuram taluk of the Cuddapah district They record a gift *pannāsa* made by a certain *Erigal- Durgarāja* during the reign of Chōla-Mahārāja. In the Mālepāḍu plates of Puṇyakumāra, Mahēndravikramavarman, son of Dhanañjayavarman, who became the lord of the Pāṇḍya, Chōḷa and Kēsaḷa countries is stated to have acquired the title of ‘ Chōla-Mahārāja’ which was likewise borne by his son Puṇyakumāra (Ep. Ind., Vol. XI, p. 337, ff). The king Chōla-Mahārāja of the present inscription must therefore be indentified with either of these two or a successor of theirs, who ruled over the Rēnāṇḍu-7000 country comprising the modern Cuddaph district in the 8th and 9th centuries A.D. The chief Erigal-Durgrāja is not known to us so far from any other source. A certain Erikal-Munyarāju is known to us through an archaic Telugu inscription at Mālepāḍu (No, 392 of 1904). He was probably of the same family as Dugarāja.

**[*Bāṇa chief Dhavaḷeyarasa*](contents2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
21. Next in chronological order come the two records (No. 306 and 319). belonging to the Bāṇa chiefs who ruled over a portion of the Cuddapah and the Kolar districts in the 9th and 10th centuries A.D. The former which was secured at Poṭṭipāḍu in the Jammala madugu taluk of the Cuddapah distrcit is dated in Śaka 807 (=A.D. 885) and refers itself to the rule of Dhavaḷeyarasa of the Mahābali race. It registers a gift of land (?) to Puṇya-Bhaṭṭa of Ponmāna- pāḍu (modern Poṭṭipāḍu) and of ghee to the Bhōgapati or the District Officer, whose name is not given. In the genealogical table of the Bāṇa chiefs given by Dr. Hultzsch in Epigraphie India, Vol. X VII, p 3, the name Dhavaḷeyarasa is not mentioned, which shows that he did not belong to the main branch, but if, on account of the identical descriptive epithets borne by him, he is supposed to be a junior prince of the main line, he must be identified with either Vikramāditya Bāṇavidyādhara or his son Vijayāditya Prabhumēru, more probably the latter, since the former is known to have been a subordinate chief in Pallava Nandivarman III’s 17th regnal year (cir. A.D. 829) and Nṛipatuṅga- varman’s 24th year (cir. A.D. 868), thus having already had a rule of nearly 40 years. Dhavaḷeyarasa may, in this case, be taken as the chief’s proper name, *‘Prabhumēru’* and ‘ Vijayāditya’ being only his birudas.
