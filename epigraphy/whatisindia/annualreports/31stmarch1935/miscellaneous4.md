**[The Mysore Chief Dēvarāja.](contents4.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 82. No. 108 which comes from Viṇṇapaḷḷi in the Gopichettipalaiyam taluk of the Coimbatore distrcit belongs to the Mysore king **Devarāja-Bhūpālaka** who is described as the son of Dēvarāja-Oḍeya and the grandson of Chāmarāja-Oḍeya of Mysore and as ruling from Śrīraṅgapaṭṭaṇa. He is stated to have belonged to the Atrēya-gōtra, Āśvalāyana-sūtra and Ṛik-śākhā. The record is dated in Śaka 1593, Virōdhikṛit, and contains astronomical details giving the equivalent A.D. 1671, September 8, Friday. It registers the foundation of an *agrahāra* by the king at Viṇṇapaḷḷi under the name of Nañjanagūḍa-Dēvarājapura and the grant of 60 shares of land to as many Brahmans of various *gōtras* for the merit of his ancestors. The king is evidently identical with **Doḍḍa-Dēvarāja** who was ruling at this period from 1659 to 1672 A.D. He is known to have been a great warrior, a patron of learning, and a liberal donor. During his reign the Mysore army made inroads into the adjoining Coimbatore district and took Erode and Dhārāpuram, and on one occasion it is stated to have pursued the army of the Nāyakas as far as Trichinopoly.

**[Tirumalai Raghunathadeva-Setupati.](contents4.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 83. A copper-plate record in the collection (C.P. No. 12) belonging to the Sētupati chief **Tirumalai Raghunāthadēva,** son of Daḷavāy Sētupati Kāttadēvar comes from Tiruppattūr in the Ramnad district. It is dated in Śaka 1589, Plavaṅga. The chief claims to have performed the *Hiraṇyagarbha*-sacrifice and had the titles *Tēvainagarādhipan, Setumūlarakshādhurandharan, Rāmanāthasvāmikārya-dhurandharan, Vaigai-valanādan, Bhara-anāṭaka-praxinan and Tondiyanturaikāvalan.* The preamble given in the present record is similar to the one found for this chief in another copper plate which is published on pp. 75-77 of the *Tamil and Sanskrit Inscriptions* by Burgess and Natesa Sastri.
