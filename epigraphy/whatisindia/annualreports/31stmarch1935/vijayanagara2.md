****VIJAYANAGARA****

as the son of a certain Ādimūlaśarman of the Kāśyapa-gōṭra (No. 497 of 1926). Two Sāḷuva subordinate chiefs of Dēvarāya, viz., Tippa and Kampayyadēva-Mahārāya, are mentioned in Nos. 300 and 264 dated respectively in Śaka 1353 and 1364. **Sāḷuva-Tippa,** who is styled a *mahāmaṇḍalēśvara* with the title *Gaṇḍa-Kaṭṭāri,* is known to have been the brother-in-law of the king (Ep. Car., Vol. XI, Cd. 29). He was in charge of the Tekal country in Ṡaka 1352-53 and later, of the region round the North Arcot district in Ṡaka 1362-63 (A. S. R. for 1907-08, p. 253). **Kampayyadēva** has the titles *Mahāmaṇḍalēśvara, Misaragaṇḍa and Kaṭāri-Sāḷuva* and is said to be the son of Mahāmaṇḍalēśvara Avubaḷayyadēva-Mahārāja and Ōbāyamma. It is probable that he was identical with the Kampayya mentioned as the renovator of the Ṡiva temple at Pushpagiri in the Cuddapah district (No. 310 of 1905) and perhaps also with Erra Kampayyadēva-Mahārāja whose inscription dated in Ṡaka 1368 is found at Tirumalai in the Chittoor district (No. 254 of 1904). A certain Nala-Kamparāja is also mentioned along with Sāḷuva-Tipparāja in No. 300 which mentions one Kumāra-Timmayya as making an endowment to the temple of Vīrabhadra at Bukkapaṭṇam in the Cuddapah district, for the merit of king **Dēvaraya** and of these two chiefs. The other inscription of Dēvarāya (No. 312) mentions Yerugama Reḍḍi Mārama-Reḍḍi who constructed a tank to the south of the village Indukūru in the Cuddapah district.

**[*Sāḷuva Nara ingadēva-Maharaya.*](contents3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
65. There is only one record of **SaluvaNaraśiṅgadēva-Maharaya** in the collection which comes from the South Arcot district (No. 87). It is dated in the cyclic year Vikṛiti, corresponding to Ṡaka 1393, and refers to the effects of the **Oḍḍiyaṇ-galabhai** on the local temple. Inscriptions of the Gajapati king **Kapilēśvara** dated as early as Ṡaka 1386 are found in this district (Nos. 51 and 92 of 1919). Altogether six villages. viz., Tirukkōyilūr (No. 1 of 1905), Aragaṇḍanallūr (No. 111 of 1934-35), Nerkunram (No. 213 of 1934-35), Jambai (No. 93 of 906), Iḍaiyār (No. 287 of 1929) and Āvūr (No. 310 of 1919) are so far known to have been affected by this invasion. Since these village excepting Āvūr are situated within about 7 miles from Tirukkōyilūr in the South Arcot district, it may be inferred that the brunt of the artack was felt particularly in this region. The devastation caused by this Orissan invasion to some temples in South India has been noticed in the *Epigraphical Report* for 1934-35 (Part II, paragraph 44).

66. No. 321 from Pālagiri in the Cuddapah district is record of **Immadi-Nararsimha,** son of Sāḷuva Narasiṁha. This is dates in Ṡaka 1426, Rudhirōd- gārir, corresponding to A.D. 1503. The inscription states that Kāmarasa- Timmayya made a gift of lands in Pālagiri situated in Muliki-nāḍu in the presence of god Viṭṭhalēśvaradēva on the bank of the Tuṅgabhadrā for worship and offerings to the god Chennakēśavarāya, for the merit of the king and of his *daṇḍanāyaka* Narasā-Nāyaka-Voḍayalu. A gift made to the same temple for the merit of these two personages by Rāchirāju Eram-Timmayaṁgāru is also mentioned in the record. The relationship between the two Timmayas mentioned in this inscription is not clear. Kāmarasa-Timma has figured in two other records copied in previous years from the Cuddapah district (Nos. 475 and 476 of 1906). In the present inscription the village Pālagiri in Muliki-nāḍu is said to have been granted as māgiṇi to the donor by Narasā-Nāyaka. Narasā-Nāyaka’s influence extended even to the distant south into the principality known as Madurai-maṇḍalam (No. 39 of 1908).

**[*His Daṇḍanāyaka Narasā-Nāyaka.*](contents4.html#_ftnref1100)**  
He had so firmly established his hold on the country, that in an inscription from the Salem district dated in Ṡaka 1420 (No. 143 of 1915), he is said to have been actually ruling the earth (pṛithivī-rājyam-paṇṇum) for his master. From a record at D¬¬ēvikāpuram in the North Arcot district (No. 357 of 1912) he is known to have died before Śaka 1425, Rudhirōgārin, Mārgaśira, śu. 2 (A.D. 1503, November 21). Since from the present inscription he is known to have been alive on October 31, A.D. 1503, his death must have occurred between this date and November 21 of that year. A record of the
