**THE CHOLAS**

70 *kalañju* was utilized for purchasing and making tax-free some specified lands for the upkeep of the temple.

**[*Coins called Rājēndraśōlan-māḍai and Rājarājanmāḍai.*](cont2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 The gold coin **Rājēndraśōlan-māḍai** is mentioned in another inscription (No. 203 of 1925) of the time of Rājēndra-Chōḷa I. Another coin called *Rājarājan- māḍai* was also current in this period (No.104 of 1925). In some later records, only the name *māḍai* equivalent to two *kāśu* finds mention (S. I. I., Vol. III, p. 136). The term *māḍai* derived from the Sanskrit word *māsha* appears to have been greatly in vogue in the Telugu districts, and may have influenced Tamil coinage. It is referred to in an inscription of the Eastern Chāḷukya king Rājarāja, father of Kulōttuṅga I *(Ind. Ant.,* Vol. XXV, p. 321, No. 25). In the succeeding centuries, the coins named *Bhujabhalavīran-māḍai, Madhurāntakan-māḍai, and Gaṇḍagōpālan-pudumāḍai* were current in the Chingle-put, Nellore and adjoining districts.

**[*Āriyan Vāsudēva-Bhaṭṭa of Kāśmīradēśam.*](cont2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 28. An incomplete record from the same place (No. 14) dated in the 39th year of the king, seems to register a sale, by the temple authorities to a certain Āriyan Vāsudēva-Bhaṭṭan *alias* Rājarāja-Brahmārāyan of Anishṭhānam in Kāśmīra-dēśa, of some temple land situated in the Tirumuḍikkurai (river island) in Viḷattūrnāḍu, a subdivision of Rājamahēndra-vaḷanāḍu. This last territorial division is already known from the inscriptions of Ratnagiri and Śivāyam in the Kulittalai taluk and seems to have comprised the locality round about that taluk. There is a tradition in the temple that certain Ārya-Brāhmaṇas from the Gauḍadēśa in the north came to Śrīraṅgam with treasure as offerings to the god and that prior to its acceptance by the deity, it was left at the entrance and guarded by some *Ārya-Brāhmaṇas,* and that this place came consequently to be known afterwards as the Ārya-bhaṭṭāl-vāśal. The *Kōyilolugu* (p. 6) which refers to this story dates it in an impossibly early period, *viz.,* Kali 360. Since the earliest reference to the Ārya-bhaṭṭāl is only found in this inscription, their connection with the temple is probably to be dated from about this period, i. e., 12th century A.D. In this connection it may be mentioned that other natives of Kāśmīradēśam also figure in records of the 12th century A.D. in the Chingleput and Ramnad districts *(Ep. Rep.* for 1928-29, Part II, para. 36), testifying to the fact that the influx of the remote northerners as pilgrims to the important temples of South India was particularly prevalent in this period.

**[*A social custom of the shepherd class.*](cont2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 No. 165 which comes from Karūr is dated in the 43rd year of Kulōttuṅga- Chōḷadēva without any attribute or historical introduction. The high regnal year makes it assignable to Kulōttuṅga I. It records an agreement by the shepherd community *(tiruvāyppāḍi-nāṭṭār)* of the place to present a sheep to the temple of Jalaśayanattu Paḷḷikoṇḍaruḷiugira-Ālvār at Karuvūr[\*](cho4.html#_ftn1) in Veṅgāla-nāḍu, a subdivision of Vīraṥōlamaṇḍalam, on the occasion of the nuptials *(kaṭṭil-ērudal)* of their sons or on the occasions when their daughters were sent to set up their family and also on the occasion of *talaimani* of their children. A similar convention among the *Manrāḍi* class is recorded in an inscription coming from Bāhūr in the French Territory (S. I. I., Vol. VII, No. 804) dated in the reign of Rāshṭrakūta Kannara- dēva, which provides for the gift of a sheep on the occasion of *kaṭṭil-ērudal,* in the case of one who comes from outside *(puranāḍu)* also.

**[*Vikrama-Chōḷa.*](cont2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 29. Of Vikrama-Chōḷa there are only two inscriptions (Nos. 263 and 33) dated respectively in his 14th and 16th years. The later one from Śrīraṅgam which begins with the introduction *‘pūmālaimiḍaindu’* provides for feeding the *apūrvi-*Śrīvaishṇavas in the temple on *amāvāsyā* days and 10 Malayāṇa (Malayāḷa) Śrīvaishṇava-Brāhmaṇas on the festivals days in the Paṅguni month, by a certain Śīriḷaṅgōn Tirunāḍuḍaiyān, who had purchased the lands required therefor in the 13th and 14th years of the king. The inscription closes with a statement that this charity was to be under the protection of *Mūnru-maṇḍalattu Abhimānabhūshaṇar*, instead of with the usual formula *Śrīvaishṇava-rakshai.* The Mūnru-maṇḍalam is perhaps Toṇḍai-maṇḍalam, Śōla-maṇḍalam and Pāṇḍi-maṇḍalam, but who the Abhimānabhūshaṇār were is not clear. It may also be mentioned here that Another expression viz. ‘ Padineṇvishayattu Śrīvaishṇavar’ occurs in inscriptions.

**[*Kulottuṅga-Chōḷa II.*](cont2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 30. Kulōttuṅga-Chōḷa II is represented by two inscriptions, both from Śrī-raṅgam (Nos. 56 and 55) with the introduction *Pūmannu-padumam,* dated respectively

[\*](cho4.html#_ftnref1) This is evidently the image of Raṅganātha recently recovered and preserved in the local temple, though without worship.
