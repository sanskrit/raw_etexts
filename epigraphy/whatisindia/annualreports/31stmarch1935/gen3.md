**GENERAL**

natural caverns which have now been partitioned by brick-walls and are being used by some local mendicants as their habitations. In their general appearance they bear strong resemblance to the rock caverns of Madura from which Brāhmī inscriptions of about the 2nd century B.C. have been copied in previous years, testifying to their having served as winter resorts of the Jaina and Bauddha monks of those times. If the caverns at Tirukkaḷākkuḍi can be divested of their modern additions, it is possible that we may discover the usual rock-hewn stone beds probably with inscriptions in early Brāhmī script. A stray seated image of a god, attributable to the 12th century A. D., with his two hands in *abhaya* and *varada* pose and canopied by a five-hooded serpent, which was found in the compound of the Śiva temple on the hill bears a close resemblance to the Nāgarāja image (in standing pose) in the Jaina temple at Nagerkoil figured in *Travancore Archaeological Series,* Vol. II, Plate VIII, and lends support to the view that Jainism might have persisted in this place for a considerable time after it was replaced by Śaivism.

**[*Sculptures of Agastya and Pulastya.*](cont.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 The rock-cut Kakōḷanātha temple on the hill contains the usual double verandah in front of the central shrine on either side of which is a panel bearing in relief sculptures more than 7 feet high, of what are popularly known as Agastya and Pulastya. The former is hidden from view by some modern additions of walls. The image of Pulastya is represented in a standing pose with the right hand pointing to the central shrine and the left holding a lotus bud. The *jaṭā* tied up into a top knot, the hanging ear-lobes and the lower garment tucked up in a particular style are indicative of an early age for the sculpture. This bears a close resemblance in style to some of the sculptures in the cave temples of the adjacent Pudukkottai State. Whether this figure is an orthodox representation of the sage Pulastya himself or is meant as a portrait sculpture of the excavator of the cave is not certain. There are also figures of the *Saptamāṭris* carved in relief on the rock in a niche outside the temple and a rock-cut image of Gaṇēśa in a niche near a spring.

**[*Caverns with beds in the South Arcot district.*](cont.html#_ftnref1100)**  
8. In the South Arcot district also several rock caverns resembling those at Tirukkaḷākkuḍi mentioned above and at other places of the Ramnad and Tinnevelly districts have been found during the year. There are however no Brāhmī or early Tamil inscriptions in any of them to enable us to fix their age. These also appear to have been associated with Jaina monks like their prototypes in the south. The hillocks containing these are locally known as *Pañchaṇāmpārai* (the rock of the Five) which remind us of the Pāṇḍavarpaḍukkai (the bed of the Pāṇḍavas) in the caverns of the southern districts. Such rocks are found at Chōḷavāṇḍipuram, Toṭṭi a hamlet of Kīranūr, Sandaippēṭṭai a suburb of Tirukkōyilūr on the way to Kīranūr, and Oḍḍanandal about 5 miles from Tiruveṇṇainallūr. The one at Toṭṭi is the most interesting of these. To the north of the road, in a waste land about a furlong from this hamlet, is a group of big boulders provided with a flight of steps cut on the rocks on all the four sides and leading up to the top, where there are three or four series of beds with pillows of varying sizes and number, cut on the surface of the rocky boulders with overhanging rocks above them. Thus one group consists of five beds in a single row each measuring about 3’ X 1’, and another, of three beds of the same size while the third group consists of only two beds. The space between the overhanging rock and the bed is not more than 3’ high so that one has to creep in to reach the beds. Two of the beds again are cut in the shape of steps to serve as benches with backs with a seating capacity for two or three persons abreast. The Pañchaṇāmpārai at Śandaippēṭṭai is a huge rock inside the margin of the lake, the top of which is reached by a flight of steps cut on its sides. There are two sets of two beds each on this rock protected by an overhanging boulder. On the western slope of the rock high above the ground is an inscription of Kulōttuṅga II (noticed in para. 30 below). About a furlong to the north of the rock known as *Āñjanēyanpārai* (because of the figure of Āñjanēya cut in relief thereon) at Oḍḍanandal is a group of four or five big boulders, one resting upon another in curious positions, thus affording four recesses in the sides in which again are cut beds with pillows, Access to the recesses is very difficult. A flight of narrow steps leads from the middle portion to the top of the loftiest of these boulders which has a sheer drop of about 50 feet on all its sides to the ground level.

**[*Jaina antiquities at Chōḷavāṇḍipuram.*](cont.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 Choḷavāṇḍipuram seems to have been a place of importance to the Jainas in the 10th and 11th centuries A.D., as evidenced by the sculptures carved on the groups of boulders on the hillock called Aṇḍimalai at this place. An image of
