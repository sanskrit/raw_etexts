****KAKATIYAS****

and Ambadēva’s family, which was hitherto not known (Ep. Rep. for 1906, p. 63, and *Historical Inscriptions of Southern India,* p. 359), and states that the former’s sister was Chandaladēvī who bore to Amba-Kshmāpa two sons, viz. Janārdana (i.e. Jannigadēva) and Tripurāntaka (i.e. Tripurāridēva). Since Ambadēva is separately introduced as the latter’s younger brother (anuja), it is possible that he was born of a different mother. The earliest and latest inscriptions, so far known of Ambadēva are dated respectively in Śaka 1194 (No. 168 of 1905) and 1224 (No. 414 of 1911). In 1930-31 a record was secured at Satrasāla in the Palnad taluk of the Guntur district which bears the Śaka date 1166, Krōdhin and introduces the chief **Gaṇḍapeṇḍāra Ambayyadēva** as a subordinate of Kākatīya Gaṇapatidēva, with the titles *Ativishama-hayārūḍha, Dāmōdarasainya-diśāppaṭṭa* etc. (No. 314 of 1930-31.) This chief has been taken, in the Epigraphical Report for that year, to be the Ambadēva whose inscriptions range in date from Śaka 1194 to Śaka 1213 (ibid. p. 46). But since his latest year is Śaka 1224, this would give him a rule of not less than 58 years without admitting of any regal power for his two elder brothers Janārdana and Tripurāri. Two dates are known for Jannigadēva *viz*. Śaka 1181 (No. 208 of 1905) and Śaka 1186 (No. 610 of 1907) and one for Tripurāridēva i.e. Śaka 1194 (No. 248 of 1905) which was probably his last year. Hence *Gaṇḍapeṇdāra* Ambayyadēva of the Satrasāla inscription must be a different person from the brother of Tripurāridēva and must be identified with his father Amba-Kshmāpa of the present record. Since the defeat of Dāmōdara is also claimed by the Mahāmaṇḍalika Gaṅgayya-Sāhiṇi (No. 231 of 1905), it is reasonable to suppose that both himself and his brother-in-law, i.e. Amba-Kshmāpa, achieved this exploit conjointly under the Kākatīya king Gaṇapati. The defeat of Dāmōdara’s forces is claimed also by Tripurāntaka in a record dated in Śaka 1151, Pramādi *(Nellore Inscriptions,* Darsi 57). It is possible that Tripurāntaka also had a share in this campaign. It may be noted that the Śaka year 1151 did not combine with Pramādi which is perhaps a misreading and the intended date appears to be Śaka 1191 Pramōda for which year the other details given in the record are perfectly regular. This date for Tripurāntaka is rendered plausible since he must have succeeded his elder brother Jannigadēva some time after Śaka 1186.
