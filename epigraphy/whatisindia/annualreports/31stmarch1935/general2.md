**[The Kāṅgayars of the Poruḷandai-gotra in the Salem district.](contents4.html#_ftnref1100)**  
88. A copper-plate record (C.P.No. 10) received from the Deputy Tahsildar of Rāśīpuram in the Salem district is engraved on a single plate shaped like a tray with raised rims all round. It is incised in modern and faulty Tamil and dated in the cyclic year Rudhirōdgārin. To give the record an air of historicity the names of several Vijayanagara kings are jumbled together in the preamble and the document itself is said to have been issued in the reign of Muttu-Vīra- Chokkaliṅga-Nāyaka, whose ancestry is traced from Vīrappa-Mudaliyār and Vīrappa-Muttu Kṛishṇappa-Mudaliyār. Though these names are reminiscent of those of the Nāyakas of Madura, and the cyclic year Rudhirōdgārin corresponds to A.D. 1683, which immediately followed the last year of the reign of Chokkanātha of Madura, it is doubtful whether this record could be assigned to that period. It stated that several Kongu-Veḷḷāḷas and Koṅgu Maṇṇāḍiyār living in Darumāpuram and the several **nadus** such as Pūndurai-nāḍu, Ēlūr-nāḍu, Parittipaḷḷi-nāḍu and places like Kāḍaiyūr, Muttūr etc., met together and presented some land and the right to collect certain specified cesses from among themselves to Ponnāli-Pulāvan, son of Mudali-Gavaṇḍan Tittāppēru and grandson of Nalla-Gavuṇḍan of Darumāpuram, on whom they also conferred the title ‘ Poruḷandai-kulam-echchan ’ probably as the spiritual guru of the Poruḷandai community.

**[Labelled sculptures at Chidambaram.](contents4.html#_ftnref1100)**  
89. The east and west *gōpuras* of the Naṭarāja temple at Chidambaram are rich in sculptures whose value as pieces of art is increased by the explanatory labels attached to most of them. The inner walls of the *gōpuras* contain the well-known figures representing the sculptural exposition of the art of dancing (See Ep. Rep. for 1914, pp. 74 ff), while all round the outer walls are found images of *likpālas* such as Indra, Agni, etc. enshrined in niches. The niches especially in the west *gōpura* bear labels in the Grantha script which may be assigned to the 13th century A.D. One such label gives the name of **Dhanvantari** and the image in this riche is represented as an aged man with a beard and a potbelly in a standing pose wearing a *yajñōpavita* and a lower cloth reaching down to the ankle. Both the hands are unfortunately broken, so that we are not in a position to know what the objects were which they should have held. According to the *Vishṇudharmōttara,* Dhanvantari should be sculptured as a handsome person carrying in both the hands vessels containing *amrita.* He is considered to be one of the minor manifestations of Vishṇu. On the inner wall in the north gōpura of the same temple which was built by the Vijayanagara king Kṛishṇadēvorāya (No. 371 of 1913), the names of the four architects who apparently constructed this gōpura are given above small sculptures representing them. Their names are, Śēvakapperumāl of Vriddhagiri (Vṛiddhāchalam), his son Viśuvamuttu, Tirumaruṅgan of Tiruppiraikkoḍai and his brother Kāraṇāchchāri (Nos. 17-20). The practice of incising labels below the images for their identification was not so common in the Tamil country as in Mysore in the Hoysala period, where the names not only of the deities but also of their sculptors were sometimes given.
