**MISCELLANEOUS**

his title *Kachchiyun-Tañjaiyuṅ-goṇḍa.* Some of these titles occur in his Jura *praśasti* also *(Ep. Ind., Vol. XIX, p. 287).* The record registers the gift, by the king, of the village **Urumūr** to two groups of Bhaṭṭaputras called *Aiññūrruvar* and *Munnūrruvar* of the *Sahasravar* community. The record is quaintly worded and contains errors, apparently because it had been engraved by an ignorant mason. The gift is called a Rāmadatti, and the figures of a cow with calf, with a man seated in front, are sculptured in low relief in a small panel at the left-hand corner of the inscription. The village granted, namely Urumūr, whose geographical location is not specified, may perhaps have to be identified with Pādūr itself, though there is a village by name Erumūr in the Vriddhachalam taluk in the same district, which is referred to us Urumūr in the inscriptions of that place.

**[*The Śilāhāra king Gaṇḍarāditya.*](cont3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 72. A set of three copper-plates belonging to the Karad branch of the Śilāhāra dynasty was received during the year from the Agent to the Governor General, Deccan States and Resident at Kolhapur. An article on this grant has since been published in the *Epigraphia Indica* (Vol. XXIII, No. 5). It is dated in Śaka 1048 in the reign of king **Gaṇḍarāditya** who was ruling the country from his capital at Vallavāḍagrāma. In this record his genealogy is traced from Jatiga I of the Jīmūtavāhana family, but it slightly differs from that given in the other grants of the family, in that it omits to mention Ballāḷa and gives only the names Gūhala and Bhōjadēva among the elder brothers of the king. The inscription states that at the request of Mailapayya, the *Mahāpradhāna* and *Kaḍitāmātya* of the king, who had renovated the temple of Khēḍādityadēva at Kollāpura and installed therein the images of Brahmā and Vishṇu, Gaṇḍarāditya granted lands as *sarvamānya* after their purchase from two *nārgāmuṇḍas* at Konnijavāḍagrāma in Koḍavalli-khampaṇa, a subdivision of Miriñjidēśa, for carrying out periodical repairs to the above temple and for feeding twelve *Brāhmaṇas* therein daily. This gift was entrusted to the charge of eight Brahmans who constituted the *Brahmapuri* and were remunerated therefor by special endowment of lands and house-sites.

**[*The Chēra kings Kōdai Ravi and Śrīvāḷarama.*](cont3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 73. The three records belonging to the Chēra dynasty copied this year from the West Coast are all of them much damaged. No. 287 from Indiyanūr in the Ernad taluk of the Malabar distrcit is dated in the 27+1st year of king **Kōdai-Ravi,** while another damaged epigraph from the same place (No. 286) belongs to Kō-**Śrīvāḷarāmavarman,** with the regnal year 4+4. King Kōdai-Ravi has figured in several records from Taḷi and Aviṭṭattūr, while No. 286 is the second epigraph so far found for Śrīvāḷarāma, the other being No. 220 of 1895 found in the temple of Tirumannūr-Bhaṭāra and issued in the same 4+4th regnal year. No. 285 is, however, an inscription belonging to a new ruler named **Kōdai-Kōdai,** whose place in the Chēra genealogy is not clear.

**[*The Reḍḍi king Ana-Vota.*](cont3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 74. A copper-plate inscription (No. 4 of App. A) secured from the Gudivada taluk of the Kistna distrcit, belongs to the Reḍḍi king **Ana-Vōta** and registers the gift of the village Kōḍūru renamed Annavōtapuram, on the banks of the Malāpahā to a number of brahmans by the king on the occasion of a solar eclipse. The inscription is dated in Śaka 1280, expressed by the chronogram *gagan-ēbhasūrya.* It is the only copper-plate inscription of this king so far discovered. His stone inscriptions known till now range in date from Śaka 1275 *(Nellore Inscriptions,* Vol. III, p. 1037, Ongole 78), to Śaka 1283 (No. 258 of 1897). The composer of the record is Vidvān **Bālasarasvatī** who is already known to us as the composer of three inscriptions of his successor Ana-Vēma (No. 20 of 1915, C. P. Nos. 6 of 1919-20 and 9 of 1922-23), for whom the earliest date known is Śaka 1293. Two stone inscriptions (Nos. 327 and 328) from Vellaṭūru belong to Kōmaṭi Vēma-Reḍḍi and are dated in Śaka 1340. They register gifts of lands, etc., to the temples of Agastyēśvara and Kēśavarāya respectively by the *Ekkaṭilu, i.e.,* the soldiers in the service of the king. The *Ekkaṭis* are also mentioned in No. 309 of this year. It is of interest to notice that like the soldiers of the Pāṇḍya army at Peruṅguḷam *(Ep. Rep.* for 1932-33, Part II, para. 31), these soldiers also had a corporate existence and made gifts of lands, etc., to temples as a collective body.

**[*The Nāyaka chiefs of Giṅgee.*](cont3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
75. A few Nāyaka chiefs of Gingee are mentioned in the records copied from Śrīraṅgam and Tirukkōyilūr. **Vaiyappa-Nāyaka** figures in an epigraph (No. 265) dated in Pramōdūta corresponding to A.D. 1569, and his son Kṛishṇappa-Nāyaka in an
