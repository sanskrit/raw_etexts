**THE HOYSALAS**

52. The year’s records of the Hoysaḷa kings come mainly from Jambu- kēśvaram in the Trichinopoly district, and only two kings, *viz,;* Sōmēśvara and Rāmanātha are represented in them. In a fragmentary inscription (No.439) dated in the 23rd year of Rājarāja III corresponding to A. D. 1239, reference is made to the **killing of a Ballāḷadeva** by a chieftain named **Gaṇḍagōpāla.** This inscription is historically interesting and in para. 42 above, the victim of Gaṇḍagōpāla has been identified with Narasimha II.

**[*Vīra-Sōmēśvara.*](cnt2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 No. 5 belonging to **Vīra-Sōmēśvara** refers to the temple of god Saṅga- mallīśvaramuḍaiya-Nāyanār, while No. 12 of the 6th year of Rāmanātha men- tions Saṅgamīsvaram-Udaiyār, at Vīranārasiṁha-chaturvēdimaṅgalam near Tiruvānaikkā The latter and not Saṅga-. mallīśvaram appears to be the correct name of the god, and it may have owed its origin to some Hoysaḷa general named Saṅgamadēva, as suggested by the name Saṅgamadēvar-maṭha occurring in the former inscription. As this shrine is specifically stated to have been located at Tiruvānaikkā, the word ‘Saṅgama’ need not refer to the confluence of the Kāvērī and the Koḷḷiḍam which is about 4 miles distant from Jambukēśvaram. Sōmala-Mahādēviyār is referred to as an *avvai* (aunt) of the king in No. 5 and in the other record (No. 6 ) as the *kumāri* of Ballāḷadēva, evidently Ballāḷa II.

**[*Vira-Ramanatha.*](cnt2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 53. It is stated in the record of king **Rāmanātha** mentioned above that another deity named Viśvēśvaradēva had been installed on the eastern side of the Saṅgamīśvaram-Uḍaiyār temple by a certain Śaṅkara-Bhaṭṭan of Puḷḷalūr. No. 4 dated in the 14th year of Rāmanāthadēva mentions that the gōśālai in front of the Akhilāṇḍanāyakiyār shrine in the fourth *prākāra* was built by **Pālapaḷḷi Nilakaṇṭha-Nāyakkar** and that the god Paśupatīśvaram-Uḍaiyār was also con- secrated therein. In this inscription the mention of the name of a garden called ‘Śilandiyai-Śōlanākkinān –tiruttōppu’ is reminiscent of the *Periyapurāṇam* story, that a spider which had woven its web over the *liṅga* at this place to protect it from the sun’s rays. was, as a reward for this meritorious deed, born in its next birth as the powerful Chōḷa king named Kōchcheṅgaṇṇān. Another shrine of god Eḍuttaruḷiyapādīśvaram-Uḍaiyār which was newly conse-crated on the eastern side of the first *prākāra* at the instance of a certain Tirujñānasambandar of Karuppūr is referred to in Nos. 25 and 26, dated in the 6th year of Rāmanāthadēva. The building activities of the Hoysaḷa kings at Jambukēśvaram have already been noticed in the *Epigraphical Report* for 1936-37, Part II, para. 48.
