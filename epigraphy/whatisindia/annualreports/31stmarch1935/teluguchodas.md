****TELUGU CHODAS****

[Mahāmaṇḍalēśvara TribhuvanamalladēvaChōḍa-mahārāja, a subordinate of  
Tribhu-vanachakravar in Kulōttuṅga-Chōḍadēva.](contents2.html#_ftnref1100)  
26. The Telugu Chōḍas are represented by four inscriptions (Nos. 217, 221 224 and 308) of which the first three are from the Vinukonda taluk of the Guntur district and the last from the Jammalamadugu taluk of the Cuddapah district. The earliest among these (No. 217) is dated in Śaka 1070, the 4th regnal year of Tribhuvanachakravartin Kulōttuṅga-Chōḍadēva and records a gift of land made by Mahāmaṇḍalēśvara Tribhuvanamalla Dēvachōḍamahārāja ‘ who was a jewelled lamp to the family of Kalikāla who had constructed an embankment to the Kavērī’. This chief is the same as the son of Kāmadēva (*cf. Ep. Rep.* for 1900. p. 16. Pedigree Branch A) for whom the earliest known date is Śaka 1059. Since in Śaka 1073, records of himself and his son Nannichōḍa are found (S.I.I., Vol. VI, Nos. 613 and 646), it may be concluded that this was the last year of his regin. Tribhuvanachakravartin Kulōttuṅga chōḍa, whose 4th regnal year fell in Śaka 1070 cannot be identified with certainty. If he is the same as the Chāḷukya-Chōḷa king Kulōttuṅga-chōḍa II whose Bapatla inscription cites śaka 1066 as his 12th year (*Ep. Ind.,* Vol. X, page 136), and śaka 1070 as his 6th year (S. I. I., Vol. IV No. 1044), the regnal year quoted in the present record cannot be accounted for. Further, from a study of the dates given in the records of himself and his son Rājarāja found in the Guntur and Tanjore districts, it has been surmised that Kultōtuṅga-chōḍa II ceased to regin, and was succeeded by his son, in A. D. 1146 (Sewell’s *Hist. Inss. of Southern Indi* , p. 106). But in A. D. 1147 he is still represented as a ruling king (Ś.I.I., Vol. VI, No. 133) and the present record extends his regin by one year more. The reason for citing Śaka 1070 as his fourth year has however to be cleared up by future researches. It may be noted that a record from Valaparla in the Ongole taluk of the Guntur district (Rangacharya’s *inscription of the Madras Presidency* Vol. II. p. 803, No. 467) is dated in the 16th regnal year of Tribhuvanachakravartin Kulōttuṅga-chōḍa which is equated with Śaka 1070 and mentions the same Telugu-Chōḍa chief Tribhuvanamalla-Dēvachōḍamahārāja as a donor. From the overlapping of the two reigns it may be surmised that Rājarāja was co-regent with his father Kulottuṅga-Chōḍa II during the last few years of the latter’s regin.

**[Vijaya-Dēvachōḍamahārāja, Kalikāla-Chōḍamahārāja.](contents2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
27. No. 221 secured at Koṇḍramuṭḷa introduces another Chōḷa chief namely Vijaya-Dēvachōḍamahārāja, son of Kalikala-Chōḍamaharāja. The latter is mentioned in a record of Kulōttuṅga-Chōḍadēva I dated in his 37th regnal year, i.e. A.D. 1108 (No. 265 of 1905). The epithets borne by Vijaya-Dēvachōḍa are identical with those assumed by Tribhuvanamalla-Dēvachōḍa mentioned above. The record is dated in Śaka 1687 and registers a gift of land made by son of this chief to the temple of Mallikārjunadēva at Goṇḍamuṭṛa (modern Koṇḍramuṭḷa). The next chief of the family brought to notice during the year is Mahāmaṇḍalēśvara Kandūri Bhīma-Dēvachōḍamahārāja, who is stated to have granted the village Kūchakopalli (modern Kūchenapalle where the inscription was found) to the temple of Yēlēśvara. The chieftain does not bear any epithets by which he may be connected with the Telugu Chōḍas of the Kali Kāla family. His name however, suggests that he might have been a prince of that family. The Kandūri family figures, however, in a few inscriptions of the Nizam’s States recently examined by me.

28. No. 308 from Tāḷḷaprodduṭūru introduces to us a certain Gaṅgaya- Dēvachōḷamahārāja, son of Allugaṅgarāja and Gaṅgādēvī and states that he dug a tank called ‘ Gaṅgasamudra’ after the name of his parents in Śaka 1244, Dundubhi (—A.D. 1322). He is given a string of epithets among which mention may be made of the following :—Nandagirinātha, Orayūripuravarādhīśvara, Oraūra-Bhīmani-śirah-kandukōtpātana, samśobhita-tatsantati-latāprarōha, Aśvārōha-Gaṇḍapeṇḍāra Gaṇgayasāhiṇisarvabandīkāra. Oraūra-Bhīma who appears to have belonged to the TeluguChōḍa family *(tatsantati)*
