**THE VIJAYANAGARA KINGS**

**[*Reference to Oḍḍiyan-galabhai.*](cnt3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
65. No. 416 from Tiruppālaippandal (South Arcot), a record of **Sāḷuva** **Narasiṅgadēva-Mahārāja** dated in Śaka 1393, is a copy of those found at several places such as Tirukkōyilūr, Nerkuṇam, etc., in the Tirukkoyilur taluk. It states that owing to the *Oḍḍiyan-galabhai,* worship in the temples of gods TirunāgēśvaramUḍaiyār at Tiruppālaippandal and Brahmīśvaram-Uḍaiyār at Pāśāru, and in the Jaina temples at Panaippāḍi and Ponparappu had ceased and that by the grant of some exemptions of taxes on the deserted *dēvadāna* lands belonging to them, worship was received in these temples during the king’s reign. As this was a copy of the same original, the irregular details of date found in the other records are also repeated here *(Ep. Rep.* for 1936-37, paragraph 59).

**[*Kōnēridēva-Mahārāja.*](cnt3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 66. Mahāmaṇḍalēśvara **Kōnēridēva-Mahārāja** figure in four inscriptions. Two of them (Nos. 115 and 116) coming from Śrīraṅgam are dated simply in the cyclic year Parīdāpi and register his gift of the doors of the *gōpura* now called the Chokkappānai-vāśal-gōpura, and an endowment of three vēli of land in Pichchāṇḍārkōyil for providing *musarōdaram* (curd-rice offerings) to the god in his name. No. 145 from Tiruchchendurai is also dated in the same cyclic year, which must have corresponded to Śaka 1414 (=A.D. 1492-3), and registers an incomplete transaction relating to the exemption of taxes on the lands belonging to the temple of Tiruchchendurai-Uḍaiya-Nāyanār at Īśānamaṅgalam. Regarding this Kōnēridēva-Mahārāja and his partiality for Śiva temples, the *Kōyilolugu* contains some interesting details which have already been referred to in the *Report* for 1936-37, para. 78.

**[*Sāḷuva Saṅgamadeva-Maharaja.*](cnt3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 67. Two records from Anbil in the Trichinopoly district belong to the time of Mahāmaṇḍalēśvara **Sāḷuva Saṅgamadēva-Mahārāja** (Nos. 149 and 152). One of them (No. 149) which is dated in Śaka 1400, Vikāri, and which gives him the titles *Śambuvarāya-sthāpanāchārya, Dakshiṇa-suratrāṇa-vibhāṭa, Kalyāṇapurava- rādhīśvara and Dharaṇīvarāha,* does not mention the name of the Vijaya- nagara overlord. In two other records copied from the same village (Nos. 593 and 594 of 1902), the same Sāḷuva chief figure with the same birudas. In No. 593 of 1902 dated in Śaka 1408, the Vijayanagara overlord Prauḍhadēvarāya is mentioned, while the other of Śaka 1403 is issued independently by the chief. Owing, perhaps, to a temporary weakness of the central government in this distant part of the empire, Saṅgamadēva seems to have been semi-independent in Śaka years 1400 and 1403, while a few years later, he appears to have been forced to acknowledge the overlordship of the king *(Archl. Survey Report* for 1909, page 167). The two titles *Śambuvarāya-sthāpanāchārya and Dakshiṇa-suratrāṇa-vibhāṭa* may have been assumed by him in virtue of the fact that an earlier member of the Sāḷuva family, *viz.,* Sāḷuva-Maṅgu had actually taken part in the campaigns against Rājanārāyaṇa-Śambuvarāya resulting in the installation of another Śaṁbuvarāya named Venrumaṇkoṇḍa and against the Madura Sultan, because there were no Śambuvarāya chieftains or Madura Sultans about A. D. 1486, the date of this record. The chief is said To have constructed a *maṇḍapa* in the Vishṇu temple at Anbil and called it the **‘Saṅgamarāyan-tirumaṇḍapam ’** (No. 152).

**[*Tuḷuva Vīra-Naraśingaraya.*](cnt3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 68. **Vira-Naraśingarāya** of the Tuḷuva dynasty figures in only one inscription in the collection (No. 214), which comes from Chidipirāla in the Cuddapah district. Reference is made in it the **Sāḷuva Gōvindarāju,** son of Rāchirāju of the Kauṇḍinya-gōtra and the Yajuś-śākhā as governing this region as a *nāyarikara* under the king. The object of the grant in this damaged record is not clear, but as in its concluding portion the *suṅkam* (tolls) leviable on the head of cattle, sold probably in the locality, such as, buffaloes, bulls, cows and horses, is specified, and the taxes on marriages performed in the region are also mentioned, it is probable that these taxes had to be collected and given over for providing worship in the temple of Agastīśvara at Chadupurēla (i.e. Chidipirala).

**[*Kṛishṇarāya—his Śēṭṭūru Copper-plate grant ofŚaka 1449.*](cnt3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 69. Of **Kṛishṇarāya,** a copper-plate record was secured from the Anantapur district **(C. P. No. 10).** It is dated in Śaka 1449, Sarvajit, and states that when the king was visiting the temple of Virūpāksha on the **bank** of the Tuṅgabhadra
