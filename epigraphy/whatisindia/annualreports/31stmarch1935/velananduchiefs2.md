****VELANANDU CHIEFS****

16,000 villages (verses 34 and 35). Goṅka II is represented in the same inscription as ruling over the whole Telugu country between Kāḷahasti and the Mahēndra Mountain (verses 41 and 42). But in his own inscriptions Goṅka II’s son Rājēndra-Chōḍa II is described as the viceroy of Triśatōttara-shaṭ-sahasra, i.e. 6300-country (No. 204 and S.I.I., Vol, No. 1138) which shows that the family must have been deprived of a portion of its dominion in the intervening period. This might have been possibly effected during the unsettled period which followed the death of Kulōttuṅga-Chōḍa I, when the Velanāṇḍu chiefs appear to have become tributary to the Western Chāḷukyas of Kalyāṇi In one instance his territory (probably ancestral) is stated to have comprised only 4 0 villages (S.I.I., Vol. IV, NO. 918). From S.I.I., Vol. IV, No. 1228, we find that Velanāṇṭi Rājēndrachōḍa whom Kulōttuṅga-Chōḍa I had adopted as his son was ruling the country as a vassal of Chāḷukya Vikramāditya VI in Śaka 1042. The epithet *Chāḷukyarājyabhavana-mūlastamqha* applied to Rājēndrachōḍa in No. 204 which is dated in Śaka 1093 appears to indicate his subordinate position under one of the two branches of the Chāḷukya dynasty. A similar epithet borne in Śaka 1028 by Velanāṇṭi Goṅkarāja (No. 277 of 1905) whom I identify with Goṅka I, evidently indicates his vassalage to the Eastern Chāḷukya throne. Nos. 239 and 204, both belonging to Mahāmaṇdalēśvara Rājēndra-Chōḍayarāja are dated respectively in Śaka 1092 and 1093, the former of which records a gift of land made to the temple of Tripurāntakadēva of Komāragiri by his servant Pōli-Nāyaka ‘the lord of \[Ta\]kkarapāḍu’. This officer is not known hitherto from inscriptions.
