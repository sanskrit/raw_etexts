**THE CHOLAS**

20. The Chōḷas are represented by 76 inscriptions belonging to almost all the kings of the dynasty, including a dozen records of kings bearing merely the surnames Rājakēsarivarman and Parakēsarivarman, and they come from the Trichinopoly and South Arcot districts.

**[*Rajakesarivarman.*](cont.html#_ftnref1100)**  
The earliest epigraph is No. 141 from Kumāravayalūr in the Trichinopoly district, dated in the \[3\]1st year of a Rājakēsarivarman, and is paleographically assignable to Āditya I. It registers a gift of 30 *kalañju* of gold by the standard weight called *Viḍēlviḍugu-kal* by a Vaiśya, who is stated to have belonged to the Vaḷabhi-nāḍu and to the Vāḷabhya-gōtra. This suggests that he was a settler in this region from the north. *Viḍēlviḍugu* was a well-known surname of Nandivarman III and Nṛipatuṅga, and the standard weight which was named after one of them continued to be in vogue in the reigns of the early Chōḷa kings also. A later inscription of Rājakēsarivarman (No. 269) from Maṇakkuppam in the Tirukkoyilur taluk of the South Arcot district, which can be assigned to the 10th century A.D., is dated in the 16th year of the king. It records a gift of sheep for a lamp in the temple at Viḷinallūr (Maṇakkupam) by a certain chief Kīrttimāttāṇḍa-pēraraiyan. From the Karhad plates\* of Kṛishṇa III and No. 382 of 1905, it may be in ferred that Kīrttimārttāṇḍa was a title of that king, and as he had been in occupation of these parts, we may suppose that the donor must have been called so after the surname of Kṛishṇa III. Hence the Rājakēsarivarman of the present record may be identified with Sundara-Chōḷa.

**[*Parantaka I.*](cont.html#_ftnref1100)**  
21. Of the inscriptions of Parakēsarivarman No. 219 from Karaḍi in the South Arcot district is dated in his 23rd year, and the script of the record makes it assignable to Parāntaka’s period. In this records as well as in Nos. 220 and 221 which are dated in the 40th and 41st years of Parāntaka himself, the village is called Ravikulachūḷāmaṇi-chaturvēdimaṅgalam. It is very probable that the village was called after a surname or title of either Āditya I or Parāntaka. These two latter inscriptions, mention two of the wives of prince Gaṇḍarāditya, Vīranāraṇiyār and Śembiyanmādēviyār as donors of a lamp to the temple, while in No.220 the prince is said to be the son of queen Śōlamādēviyār. We learn from No. 149 dated in the 41st year of Parāntaka ‘ who took Madurai and Īlam’ that the *Madhyastha* of the village Nandivarmamaṅgalam named Nālāyirattu-munnūrruvan alias Chandraśēkharan Aramayindan presented to the temple at Vayalūr for singing the *Tiruppadiyam* hymns and to serve as *kavarippiṇā* to god Paramēśvara, his women-servants whom probably he had acquired as kūllāḷ earlier in the 35th year of the king. This practice of dedicating women for the service of waving fly-whisks *(kavarippiṇā)* to the deity is referred to in two other inscrip tions (No. 117 of 1910 and Ep. Carn., Vol. IX, Bn. 66). Another record of Parāntaka (No. 95) is found engraved on a slab of stone lying made by a certain Āchchiyan Bhaṭṭan alias Vāsudēvan-Chakrapāṇi of Peruveṅgūr, a *brahmadēya* in Viḷā-nāḍu, for the Paṅguni festival in the temple. It may be mentioned that the
