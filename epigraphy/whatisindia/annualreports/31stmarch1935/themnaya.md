**THE MADURA NAYAKAS**

**[*Virappa-Nayaka.*](cnt3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
(74. The earliest records of this family copied this year belong to **Vīrappa- Nāyaka** of the family of Viśvanātha-Nāyaka (Nos. 1 and 2). These are engraved on the pedestal of the two bronze images of *dvārapālakas* flanking the entrance into the central shrine of the Jambukēśvara, temple at Tiruvānaikkā. These images are said to be the gift of Karaṇikam **Deyvaṅgaḷperumāḷ,** son of Iḷaiyanayinār of Karuppūr in Iruṅgōḷappāṇḍi¬-vaḷanāḍu. The images are 4 feet high and stand on pedestals about 18” high, and are good specimens of the metallic sculptural art of the 16th century A.D. As a record of Kṛishṇa-Vīrappa-Nāyaka of Śaka 1517 is found at Jambukēśvaram (No. 136 of 1936-37 ), it is possible that these bronze images were also cast during his time.)
