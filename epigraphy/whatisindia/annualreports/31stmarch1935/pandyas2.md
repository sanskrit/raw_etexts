****PANDYAS****

The safety of the temples and their property seems to have been guaranteed in ancient times by such precautionary measures, as can be seen also from an inscription at Saṅgrāmanallūr in the Coimbatore district (No. 167 of 1909) wherein it is stated that the *gōpura,* the temple and its precincts were placed under the protection of soldiers. In another record from Tiruvālīśvaram in the Tinnevelly district, it is stated that the local temple, its treasury and the temple servants were placed under. the protection of the Chōḷa army called *Mūnrukaimahāsēnai* (No. 120 of 1905). The interest evinced by the *Perumapaḍaiyār* and *Valaṅgai-mahā-śēnaiyār* in the affairs of the temple at Peruṅgulam in the Tinnevelly district was also pointed out in the *Epigraphical Report* for 1932-33, p. 68.

**[*His officer Tennavan-Pallavadiyaraiyan.*](contents3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
The lady Tuḍarūri mentioned above is called the wife of Śrīkaṇthaśūra in another record from Ukkirankōṭṭai (No. 195). This suggests that Tennavan Pallavadiyaraiyan *alias* Māran Śūran noticed above was also known as Śrīkaṇṭha-Śūra. This Pallavadaiyaraiyan is stated in No. 196 to have been a *mahā nāyaka* of Kaḷakkuḍi under Śaḍaiya-Māran. He constructed a hall *(ambalam)* called *Nagarattān* for the use of the *Nagarattār* established by him in *Rāśiṅgappēraṇgāḍi,* probably named after his master king Rājasiṁha, which was newly formed by him in front of the palace. He made an endowment for keeping the hall clean and presented a *tuḍar-viḷakku* (chain of lamps) for lighting it. The sheep required for the lamp were left in charge of Nakkan Munnūrruvan and Venravāypēśi, who are called *Paḍaittalaivar* and were probably connected with the army stationed there.

To the same king may be assigned No. 203 which is a fragmentary record registering a gift of sheep for providing a stipulated quantity of ghee by the standard measure *Nārāya-nāli* to the Bhaṭāra at \[Tiru\]tturutti in Aṇḍa-nāḍu by a certain Dēya. . . . . who, to judge by the epithets *dēviyār* applied to her, should have been a lady of distinction.

47. [***Vira-Pandya.***](contents3.html#_ftnref1100) ‘ who took the head of the Chōḷa’ is represented by a single Vatteluttu inscription (No. 197) from Ukkirankōttai. It is fragmentary and is dated in his 15th year and mentions a goddess set up in the Northern entrance **to Karavanlapuram in Pāṇḍimārttāḍa-vaḷanāḍu.** In the *Epigraphical Report* Vira-Pāṇḍya ‘ who took the head of the Chōḷa,. for 1932-33 (pp. 67-68) it has been suggested that the surname Pāṇḍimārttāṇḍa might have been borne by this **Vīra-Pāṇḍya.** The territorial name Pāṇḍimārttāṇḍa-vaḷanāḍu is also mentioned in a record of Śaḍaiya-Māran, dated in his 2 + 18th year from Tiruppuḍaimarudūr in the Tinnevelly district (No. 122 of 1905) where a servant of Vīra-Pāṇḍya is also referred to.

**[*Tirappattur and its temple.*](contents3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
48. Tiruppattūr in the Ramnad district is a sacred Śaiva centre of the Pāṇḍya country and is hallowed as the place visited by the Śaiva saints Jñānasambanda and Appar who have each left a decade of verses in praise of the god. In inscriptions the deity is called Tirukkarraḷi-Bhatārar (No. 90 of 1908), Taḷipparamēś vara (No. 93 of 1908) and Tiruttaḷiyāṇḍār (No. 94 of 1908). Besides this, we have evidence in the present collection of other images such as Kūttāḍudēva (No. 183), Ōṅgukōyil-Uraivār (No. 186), Tiruvambalap-Perumāḷ and Dakshiṇāmūrti (No. 174), Tiruvādavūr-Nāyanār (No. 175) and Bāṇaliṅga-Nāyanār Kailāyamuḍaiya-Nāyanār (No. 169), which were set up in this temple at different periods. The worship of Bhairava occupies an important place in the daily ceremonies of the temple. The sculptural features of this deity do not however conform to the characteristics of Bhairava, who is here represented as a seated dwarfish figure with a paunch. This deity is called Āṇḍa-Piḷḷaiyār in the inscriptions engraved on the walls of this shrine. An inscription of the time of Tribhuvanachakravartin Kulaśēkharadēva (No. 167) mentions that the temple of Tiruttaliyāṇḍār was under the superintendence of a *tapasvin* named Tiruviḍaimaruduḍaiyān Porpadikkunāyakan Tiruchchirrambalamuḍaiyān *alias*
