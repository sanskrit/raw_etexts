**THE VIJAYANAGAR KINGS**

the documents. Both of them are connected together and purport to register grants of lands in the villages Dēvarapalle *alias* Bhāskara-kshōtram, and Jam- bulaviṇḍla *alias* Bhāskara-kshētram. in Guṭṭi-rājya as *saṛcan ārya* to a certain Hampā-jōsya, after allotting specified portions to the members of the different village services (See also C. P. No. 9 of 1920-21). It is not unlikely that they are fabrications of a late period.

**[*Bukka (I).*](cn2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 39. Next in chronological order is a record of Bukka from the Cuddapah district (No. 338), dated in Śaka 1292. It registers the establishment of a village named after the god Ahōbalēśvara at Vōyinūtula by **Maṅgayadēva-Mahārāja** for the merit of his parents Saṅkidēva and Mummaladēvī, while he was ruling at Tummalūru Peṇḍlimari in Mulki-nāḍu. This chief is the same as Sāḷuva-Maṅgu who later on became the general of Kampa and assisted him in the campaign against Śambuvarāya. A point of interest in the present record is a reference to an iron-mine *(inuparāla-ghani)* as one of the boundaries of the gift village

**[*Kampaṇa-Uḍaiyar.*](cn2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 40. We next come to Kampaṇa-Uḍaiyar whose inscription (No. 47), dated in Pramādi corresponding to Śaka 1295, mentions his *pradhāni* **Viṭṭappar,** son of Apparāju of the Bhāradvāja-gōtra, as a donor to the Śrīraṅgam temple. This Viṭṭappar is already known to us from other records as an officer of the king (treasurer) in Śaka 1283 (No. 309 of 1912), and from No. 88 of 1937-38 from Śrīraṅgam itself he is known to have had a son named Sōmanātha.

**[*Harihara II.*](cn2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 41. A set of impressions of a copper-plate grant belonging to Harihara II (C. P. No. 19) was received in this officer from the Kandukur taluk of the Nellore district. It is dated in Śaka 1298 and records the gift of the village Krāku evi- dently identical with the present Brāhmaṇa-Krāka in the Kavali taluk of the same district, surnamed Bukkarāyapuram by the king to a number of Brahmans.

**[*Virupaksha II.*](cn2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 42. Of Virūpāksha (II) son of Harihara II, there are eight inscriptions, all copied at Śrīraṅgam and ranging in date from Śaka 1305 (No. 77) to 1318 (No. 72). No. 153 consists of two Sanskrit verses, one of which states that the king was the son of Harihara and grandson of Bukka and the daughter’s son of Rāmabhūpati, while the other records the construction by the king of the *vimāna, gōpura and maṇḍapa,* and his gift of the village Pāchchil, to the temple. The first of these verses is identical with the one occurring in the drama *NārāyaṇīVilāsam,* the authorship of which is claimed by the king *(Sources of Vij. Hist. p. 53).* Another verse inscription in the same place (No. 86) purports to expound the creed of the king, *viz.,* that only he who imparts knowledge is a father. that all those who do good are (real) relations and only she who is faithful (to her husband) is a wife. The authorship of this verse can perhaps be assigned to the king himself. In two records (Nos. 77 and 76) dated in Śaka 1305 and 1307, a *pradhāni* of the king by name **Dēvarāja,** son of Saṅgamāmātya or Saṅgamarasa figures as donor. Another officer of the king was minister *(mantrin)* **Muddarasa** of the Kāśyapa-gōtra who figures in Nos. 87, 88 and 154, in the last of which he is stated to have constructed a bridge over the Kāvēri, The latest inscription of the king which is dated in Śaka 1318 ( No. 72) records the benefactions to the Raṅganātha temple at Śrīraṅgam by **Aṇṇappar Chauṇḍappar,** son of Viṭṭappaṅgaḷ of the Śrīvatsa-gōtra, evidently different from Viṭṭappa mentioned above under Kampaṇa who was of the Bhāradvāja-gōtra. These benefactions comprised the gift of a *tiruvāśigai* (aureola) to the god, the construction of pavement to the 1,000-pillared maṇḍapa in the temple, the consecration of god Viṭṭhala (therein), the gilding of the central shrine *(Rōyilālvār)* and provision for offerings and worship to the god.

**[*Devaraya I.*](cn2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 43. Of Dēvarāya I, the brother of Virūpāksha, there is an inscription (No. 407) from Peṇḍlimarri in the Cuddapah district, which records a *daśavanda* grant of land made by Mallā-Nāyaniṁgāru who held Peṇḍlimari in Mulki-nāḍu as his *nāyaṅkara.* We also get in this inscription the names of several village officials such as *Rāju, Reḍḍi, adhikāri. Karaṇam. Aṅgajāla and Koriboya*
