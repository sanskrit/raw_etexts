**THE EASTERN CHALUKYAS**

**[*Annaprāśa of his son Vishṇuvardhana.*](cnt.html#_ftnref1100)**  
Journal *Bhārati* (Vol. XVI, pp. 613 ff) by Mr. B. V. Krishna Rao. It registers a grant of land in the village **Ēlūru** in Vēṅgi-vishaya to the Brahman Śrīdhara- śarman, son of Venneśarman and grandson of Vishṇuśarman of the Bhāradvāja- sagōtra who was a native of Ayyāvoḷe (Aihoḷe), on the occasion of the *annaprāśa* ceremony of prince **Vishṇuvardhana.** This shows that Vishṇuvardhana should have been born about A. D. 682. Evidently Vishṇuvardhana is the prince i. e. the second son of Maṅgi-Yuvarāja, who came to the throne in A. D. 709 as Vishṇuvardhana III. The present grant would thus show that he was aged about 27 years when he ascended the throne and that he must have lived up to the age of 64. A point not noticed by Mr. Krishna Rao needs mention here. to the plate on its written side appears to be a palimpsest showing a few letters of an erased grant of the same dynasty. It reveals the commencement of a charter containing the expressions *varāha-lāñchhanānām aśvamedha* etc.

**[*Guṇaga-Vijayāditya III.*](cnt.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 12. The next inscription is of **Guṇaga-Vijayāditya III** engraved on a set of copper-plates (C. P. No. 2) secured for examination from the Superintendent. Government Museum Madras. This has also been published in *Bhārati* (Vol. I. pp. 90ff) and in the *Journal of Andhra Historical Research Society* (Vol. V, pp. 101 ff). This is said to have been originally discovered in the village Sātulūru in the Bandar taluk of the Kistna district. The set consists of 7 plates strung together on a ring attached to a circular **seal which is the most unique of its kind.** On the counter sunk surface of the seal are cut in relief the usual figures of a *varāha,* an *aṅkuśa,* a lotus, the Sun and the Moon and the legend *Śrī Tribhuvanāṅkuśa.* At the place where the ends of the ring are secured are figures in bold relief of Gaṇēśa and Lakshmī, back to back, and flanked on either side by a *yāḷi* inside the mouth of which the ends of the ring are soldered. The bottom of the seal is shaped like a full-blown lotus with its petals spread out all sides (*See* plate II). The inscription records the grant, by the king at the request of his (half) **brother Nṛipakāma,** of the village **Śāntagrāma,** free of all taxes, to 100 Brāhmaṇas on the day of a solar eclipse. The genealogical portion of this inscription is of interest as, in addition to the usual succession list of the king’s ancestors with the length of their reigns, which is however slightly at variance in the case of Vishṇuvardhana III and Vijayāditya II, and their achievements, it sums up in a statement that among the predecessors there were five kings bearing the name Vishṇuvardhana, two named Jayasiṁha, one named Maṅgi-Yuvarāja and that the donor himself was the third king of the name of Vijayāditya. It is significant that the record makes no reference to Maṅgi-Yuvarāja II (son of Kokkili), who issued the Koṇḍukavilaṅgavāḍa grant (Ep. Rep, for 1909, p. 105). Vijayāditya III is stated to have ruled over the Dakshiṇāpatha country together with the **Trikaliṅga**-dēśa. It is also stated of this king that he planted before his palace the symbols of the Gaṅgā and the Yamunā, the Moon and the Sun and also the *pālikētana.* He is also given the *biruda* **Vīramakaradhvaja** in this inscription. The grant is very indifferently worded. So far as we know this is among the earliest Eastern Chālukyan grants giving a long list of Brahman donees with their *gōtras* and shares.

**[*Dānārṇava─his subordinates of the Mudugoṇḍa-Chāḷukya-vaṁsa.*](cnt.html#_ftnref1100)**  
12. From Mr. Manda Narasimham of Chicacole in the Vizagapatam district was obtained a set of copper-plates (C. P. No. 26) belonging to king **Dānārṇava,** son of Bhīmarāja and half-brother of Ammarāja (II) (Vijayāditya VI). Though the date portion of the inscription is partially mutilated, the chronogram for 892 *(dvi-nava-vasu)* remains intact, and we can safely assume Śaka 892, which was the very first year of the king’s reign, as the date of this record. The inscription also gives the names of three more kings (or chiefs), Bṛihad-Bhīma, his son Kali-Vishṇuvardhana and his son Bhīma, whose relationship to the king is not however clear, as the portion of the plate containing this information is unfortunately mutilated. The last-mentioned of these is stated to have conferred, under order of the reigning king, the **governorship of Pottapi-nāḍu** along with certain insignia of the office, such as a pair of parasols, etc., upon two persons named Malliyarāja, *viz.,* that containing the the **Mudugoṇḍa-Chāūky-vaṁsa.** One of the plates, viz., that containing the date is a clear palimpsest, Mr. Narasimham has given an indifferent version of
