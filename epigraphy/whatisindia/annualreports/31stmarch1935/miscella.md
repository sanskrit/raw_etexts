**MISCELLANEOUS**

**[*The Loṅkuḷas, subordinates of the Vaiduṁbas.*](cont3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
70. Two inscriptions secured at Tsadum in the Punganur taluk, Chittoor district (Nos. 366 and 367), belong to the time of Vaidumba Vīra-Mahārāja. One of them (No. 366) states that a certain Loṅkuḷāthitya, *i.e.,* **Loṅkuḷāditya** ‘sun to the Loṅkuḷa family’, was administering Sadambu and that Peṅgāla Rāchamalla died fighting when Raṇamorkka-Śiṅga, Vāṇaraju, etc. raided the place. The other record (No. 367) is seriously damaged, but preserves some reference to the same Loṅkuḷa chief during the time of **Vaidumba Vīra-\[Mahārāja\].** This also seems to refer to the same incident, in which another hero lost is life. From these inscriptions it is clear that the Loṅkuḷas held a subordinate position under the Vaidumbas. In 1905, three inscriptions (Nos. 292-294) were copied at Basinikoṇḍa near Madanapalle which refer to the Loṅkuḷas in connection with a fight at Mudumaḍuvu. One of them (No. 293) states that Śrī-Gaṅga, a Loṅkuḷas chief, lost his life in the same combat. The Veligallu inscription of Vaidumba-Mahārāja Gaṇḍatrinētra belonging to the 9th century A.D. (No. 314 of 1922) mentions Mudumaḍuvu as a scene of battle between the Vaidumbs and the Noḷambas, etc. From a study of the contemporary record it seems to have been one of the engagements connected with the famous battle of Soremaṭi. Hence the fight at Mudumaḍuvu mentioned in the three Basinikoṇḍa inscriptions (Nos. 292 to 294 of 1905) must be placed during the time of Gaṇḍatrinētra Vaidumba-Mahārāja who was also known by the epithet Vaidumba Vīra-Mahārāja. The Vaidumba Vīra-Mahārāja of the two records under study would therefore be identical with the same Gaṇḍatrinētra, and the skirmish in which the heroes lost their lives may possibly be one of the series culminating in the battle of Soremaṭi.

**[*Rashṭrakūṭa Kannaradeva.*](cont3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 71. A Tamil record of the Rāshtrakūṭa king Kṛishṇa III comes from Pādūr in the Tirukkoyilur taluk of the South Arcot distrcit (No. 281). It is dated in the 26th year of his reign and contains astronomical details which equate to A.D. 964, October 26, thus giving A.D. 938-39 as the king’s initial date. The king is given the titles *Achalakulōttaman, Kāñchikan, Ellara-maruḷan* and *Anaiviṭaṅkan.* The title *Achalakulōttaman* was probably assumed by him in commemoration of his having overrun the country of the Malaiyamān chiefs of Tirukkōyilūr. Kāñchikan evidently refers to his having captured Kāñchī, which is further perpetuated ir
