****VELANANDU CHIEFS****

31. The Velanāṇḍu chiefs who held sway over the 6000-country south of the Kṛishṇā river prior to the advent of the Kākatīyas are represented in the present year’s collection by three inscriptions (Nos. 219, 239 and 204). The earliest among these comes from Kārumañchi in the Vinukonda taluk of the Guntur district and records a gift of land made to the temple of Tripurāntakadēva by Palla-Nāyaka and Pōti-Nāyaka, sons of Gāḍidiparu Prōlaya-Nāyaka, a warrior *(baṇṭu)* of Mahāmaṇḍalēśvara Kulōttuṅga Rājēndra-Chōḍayarāja, in Śaka 1030 (=A.D. 1108). The last chief is evidently the son of Goṅka I for

whom the dates Śaka 998 (No. 151 of 1897) and Śaka 1028 (No. 277 for 1905) Goṅka I must have died and his son Kulōttuṅga Rājēndrachōḍaya succeeded him in the interval between Śaka 1028 and Śaka 1030. The present record will thus be the earliest known inscription of the chief. It is interesting to note that Velanāṇṭi Goṅkarāja who is called ‘the chief supporter of the Chāḷukya kingdom’ made the gift

of a village in Kammanāṇḍu and was ruling over the Thousand-Three-Hundred district in Śaka 1028 (No. 277 of 1905). Kammanāṇḍu (modern Guntur district) must have comprised a portion of the Thousand Three-Hundred district, which was probably the territory originally conferred upon his father by his master Kulōttuṅga-Chōḷa I. In course of time the territory was extended so as to include almost the whole of the Telugu country and we learn from the Piṭhāpuram inscription of Pṛithvīśvara *(Ep. Ind.,* Vol. IV. pp. 32 ff) that Kulōttuṅga-Chōḷa I ‘ adopted as son’ Kulōttuṅga Rājēndrachōḍa, son of Goṅka I, and bestowed upon him the country of Vēṅgi which contained
