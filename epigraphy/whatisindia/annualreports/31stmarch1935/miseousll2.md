**MISCELLANEOUS**

of an image of Gaṇapati therein by **Paramaiyan who is called an officer** *(adśikāi)* of **virasōlar.** By Vīrachōḷa is evidently meant the Chōḷa king Parāntaka *(T.A.S. Vol. III. P. III),* under whom Paramaiyan should have served in the region before transferring his allegiance to the new ruler Kṛishṇa III. It may be noted that near this Puduppāḷaiyam in the Polur taluk is a Village by name Vaśūr with which Vaśugūr of the present inscription may be identified. Another inscription (No. 269) dated in the 25th year of the king, records a sale of land by the *sabhā* of Kāmappullūr in Vaśugūr-nāḍu to four persons who were members of the *āḷum-gaṇa* of the village for being utilised as a *dānappuram.* The beneficiaries of the gift are stated to be those who were bound by the agreement *(śāsanabaddhar),* their children born after their assumption of the ownership of the land and those who could expound the *pañchavāri kārigai (?).* Among the boundaries of the land is mentioned a tank called Narasiṅgaputtēri, probably named after the Pallava king Narasiṁhavarman.

**[*Hero-stone at Macherla.*](cn3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 62. An inscription on a hero-stone at Mācherla in the Guntur district (No. 448) dated in Śaka 988 records that certain Āchakuñjuṇḍu, evidently a soldier under **Birudu-Gāmaya, perhaps a Local chief,** offered his head to the goddess Paḍḷasāni for (the victory of) his master. This may have some reference to a local skirmish of the period in which Birudu-Gāmaya was involved. This warrior is said to have been the son of Uriya-Bētarāju and his wife Mahādēvi Mēḍama. The sculpture of the hero by the said of which this is engraved is stated to have been carved by Iruga, son of Veṅkoja.

**[*Spurious copper-plate of Vira-Satyasrayadeva Chakravarti.*](cn3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 A copper-plate grant belonging to a certain Vīra-Satyāśrayadēva-Chakra- Varti, son of Vīranārāyaṇa ‘ ruling from his *nelavīḍu* at Ayōdhipura ’, was secured on loan from the Historical Research Society, Dharwar (C.P. No. 14). It is engraved in characters of about the 12th century A.D., and the language is an obscure mixture of Mahrāṭhī and Kannaḍa, The king claims to belong to the Chāḷukya family and bears a number of high- sounding *birudas* such as *Mahārājādhirāja, Paramēśvara, Pṛithivī-vallabha, Ajaparāya-nirmūlana, Suvarṇa-varāha-lāñchchhana-dhvaja,* etc. He is stated to have made a gift of land in the village Maramuri in Kundirige-20, a subdivision of Kūṇḍi-3000, to a certain Rāma-Gāvuṇḍa in the course of his victorious campaign in the south. From the nature of its contents, this grant seems to belong to the class of spurious copper-plates of which another specimen is the grant purporting to belong to Vīra-Noṇamba-Chakravarti which has been noticed in detail in my *Report* for 1935-36, para. 10.

**[*Kēraḷa ruler Ravivarman Kulasekhara.*](cn3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 63. The Kēraḷa ruler Ravivarman Kulaśēkhara is represented by a single inscription from Tiruppaṅgili in the Trichinopoly district (No. 172). It is prefaced by the same sanskrit verses said to have been composed by the court poet Kavibhūshaṇa, which are also found record in his inscription at Śrī-raṅgam published in *Ep. Ind.* Vol. IV (pp. 149 ff.). It records the gift of the village Nerkuppai in Kānakkiḷi-nāḍu as a *dēvadāna* for the expenses of worship and offerings during the service instituted in his name and for festivals in the temple, from the 4th year of the king (i.e., A.D. 1315-16). The present inscription adds one more number to the few records of his reign found outside his own territory.

**[*Gajapati Hambīra Kumāra-Mahāpātra.*](cn3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 64. Of the Gajapati kings of Orissa there are two records this year, one being a stone inscription of Hambīra from Śrīraṅgam (No. 140) and the other, a copper-plate grant of Pratāparudra from the Nellore district (C.P. No. 7). The former is an incomplete record dated, in Śaka 1386, Subhānu, which refers itself to the reign of Dakshiṇa Kapilēśvaran Hambīra Kumāra-Mahāpātran who is stated to have made a gift of 1,000 cows for offerings and lamps to god Śrīraṅgarāja. The existence of this record so far south marks the extreme limit of **the Gajapati invasion of south India** which also finds mention in inscriptions found in a number of places specially in the South Arcot district, where several temples affected by the *Oḍḍiyan-galabai* are said to have been brought again under worship (E p, Rep. for 1936-37, para. 59). His two inscriptions at Munnūr in the South Arcot district (Nos.51 and 92 of 1919) which are dated in Śaka 1386, Tāraṇa, i.e., perhaps a few months later, must have been incised on his return from Śrīraṅgam to his capital. It may be mentioned in this connection, that
