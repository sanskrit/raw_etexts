**THE VIJAYANAGARA KINGS**

introduces a certain **Anandatāṇḍavapperumāḷ Toṇḍaimānār** of Valudilambaṭṭu  
**[*His subordinate Ānandatāṇḍavap perumāḷ Toṇḍaimānār.*](cnt3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
who bears a number of *birudas* such as *Mahāmaṇḍalēśvara Gaṇḍanārāyaṇa-tirup-paḍi-Vēḷaikkāran, Valudi-mānaṅgātta-Peru- māḷ and Tulukka-moharan-tavirttān.* The record is peculiarly worded and dated in Śaka 1461, Viḷambi, when this chieftain is stated to have accomplished his conquests *(digvijaya).* At the request of a certain Venrumālaiyiṭṭār Kaliyugarāma-Toṇḍaimānār, this chieftain is said to have made over as *tirunāmattukāṇi* the  
**[*Gift of a paṇḍāravāḍai.*](cnt3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
village Vīramaṅgalam, which had already been in the enjoyment of the temple of Ūrbhāgaṅkoṇḍaruḷiya-Mahādēva at Eriyānaraiyūr *alias* Śōlakēraḷa chaturvēdimaṅgalam, a *brahmadēya* in Paranūrkūrram, as a *paṇḍāravāḍai,* for the expenses of the car festival in the temple. He is also stated to have laid out a street called the Ānandatāṇḍavan-tiruvīdi after levelling up the rocky ground and built the car for the festival. From his title *Valudi-mānaṅgāttār,* it can be supposed that this local chieftain probably in charge of Valudilampaṭtu-sīrmai had taken part in Achyutarāya’s southern expedition against the Tiruvaḍi king and the Sāḷuva rebel Śellappar and rendered assistance to the then Pāṇḍya king (Valudi).
