**THE WESTERN GANGAS**

**[*Sasanakōṭa Plates of Mādhavavarman I.*](cnt.html#_ftnref1100)**  
18. A set of four copper-plates belonging to this dynasty was secured for examination during the years from the Collector of Anantapur (C. P. No. 4). It is said to have been discovered some years ago in the village Śāsanakōṭa in the Hindupur taluk of the district and was in the possession of Mr. K. Gopalakrishnamacharlu of the Collector’s office. The script in which the inscription is engraved is an early variety of the southern class of alphabets and is definitely anterior to that of the Penukoṇḍa plates of Mādhavavarman II and may be assigned to about the 4th-5th century A. D. It is dated in the very first year of **Mahārāja Mādhavavarman.** son of Koṅgaṇivarma-Dharmamahādhirāja of the kāṇvāyana-gōtra and the Jāhnavēya-kula, the progenitor of the dynasty who ‘established a kingdom by the strength of his own arms’, and registers the royals grant of the village **Vēlputtoru** in **Paru\[vi\*\]-vishaya** as a *brahmadēya* to a Brahman named **Dhara- Śarman** of the Vatsa-gōtra and Taittirīya-charaṇa.

 Since the publication of the Penukoṇḍa plates of Mādhavavarman II mentioned above, which was supposed to be the earliest document of the family, two earlier grants have come to light, viz., the Beṇḍigānahaḷḷi plates of Kṛishṇavarman (Mys. A. R. 1915, p. 40) and the Kuḍithiyam plates of the same king (Mys. A. R. 1932, p. 124). In both of these the king calls himself Kṛishṇavarma-Dharmamahādhirāja, son of Mādhavavarma-Mahādhirāja and grandson of Koṅguṇivarma-Dharmamahādhirāja of the Kāṇvāyana-gōtra and the Gaṅga-kula. Now on account of the earlier script of the present grant and the relationship of the kings mentioned above, this grant is the **earliest genuine copper-plate** document discovered so far not only king Mādhavavarman I but also for the Gaṅga family.\* In determining the dates of the Penukōṇḍa plates of the present king’s grandson Mādhava II. Dr. Fleet has given A. D. 475 as a very good
