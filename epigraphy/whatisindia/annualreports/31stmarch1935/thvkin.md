**THE VIJAYANAGARA KINGS**

**[*Kampa, son of Bukka.*](cnt3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
59. The records belonging to the Vijayanagara kings in this year’s collection come mainly from the Cuddapah, South Arcot, and Trichinopoly districts. The earlier ones of these belong to the time of **Kampa,** son of Bukka. No. 513 from Peruvaḷūr, in the Gingee taluk (South Arcot ) refers to the founding of a Brahman colony called Sōmaya-Daṇṇāyaka-chaturvēdimaṅgalam by **Gaṇḍaragūḷi Māraya-Nāyaka,** son of Mahāpradhāna Sōmaya-Daṇṇāyaka, in the name of his father, and records the exemption of taxes granted by him on the lands presented to ‘the temple of Tirukkōṭīśvaram-Uḍaiyār at the village. This record is dated in the cyclic year Sādhāraṇa, which corresponded to Śaka1292. No. 51 from the same village dated in Śaka 1298, Naḷa, records the gift of a plot of land and of house-site to Vēmapōśai Śaurirāja-Bhaṭṭa by **Dharaṇi-Appar,** brother of the above-said Māraya-Nāyaka. This general Māraya-Nāyaka is already known 1919), to have captured the Rājagambhīranmalai, the headquarters of the Śambuvarāyas and to have defeated Venrumaṇkoṇḍa–Śambuvarāya at that place in Śaka 1285. No. 480 from Elavānāśūr in the Tirukkoyilur taluk which is dated in Śaka 1284, Subhakṛit, registers the order of Gōpaṇa-Uḍaiyar, though it is not specifically stated to have been issued in the reign of Kampaṇa. This inscription registers a gift of land after purchase by Māṇikkanāyanār-Gāṅgēyarāyan, son of Śembōdi Villavadaraiyar of Palampaṭṭinam in Paṭṭina-nāḍu, a sub-division of Śembūr-koṭṭam, a district of Jayaṅgondaśōḷa-maṇḍalam.

**[*Viruppaṇa*](cnt3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 60. **Viruppaṇa,** son of Harihara, is represented by 5 inscriptions ranging in date from Śaka 1305 to1309. Of these No.88 from Śrīraṅgam dated in Śaka1305 mentions a certain **Sōmanāthadēva,** son of Pradhāni Viṭṭappa, son of Apparasa of the Bhāradvāja-gōtra, as having made a gift of cows to the Raṅganātha temple for a lamp, while No. 455 from Gāṅgayanūr in the Tirukkoyilur taluk dated in Rudhirōdgārin corresponding to Śaka 1306, states that some lands belonging to the temple of Tiruvaṇṇāmalai-udaiya-Nāyanār which became fallow by neglect, were reclaimed for cultivation by a certain Ulaguḍai-Nāchchiyāravvai and her father-in-law Yādavarāyar and that as a recompense for this, her son Maṇḍalapurusha was assigned this land for cultivation on favourable terms as *araivariśai –parru.* A similar transaction is registered in No. 457 from the same village, which is dated in Śaka 1308 (wrongly quoted as 1303), Krōdhana. This tenure *araivariśai* probably represents the enjoyment of the produce in equal halves by the landlord and the tenant. In the Telugu country round about Nellore this system is known as *kōrumēḍi-pāḷu* and in the Vizagapatam district as *saṅgōru-pālu.*\* No. 433 dated in Prabhave which corresponded to Śaka 1309 Provides for the service called the ‘Tiruttūdu-viṇṇappam-śeydal’ in the temple of Tiruttāntōnni-Āḷuḍaiyār at Śambai, by gift of land to a certain Sūryadēva, son of Vanneñjapperumāḷ. This function is part of a festival, in which a reconciliation after an amorous quarrel *(praṇaya-kalaha)* between the god and the goddess is ‘supposed to be effected by one of the Nāyanārs as a love-messenger *(tūdu i.e., dūta)* by the recitation of suitable songs. This service of
