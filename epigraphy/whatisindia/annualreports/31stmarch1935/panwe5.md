**THE PANDYAS**

in the absence of any other evidence, the king may be tentatively identified with Māravarman Parākrama-Pāṇḍya of accn. A. D. 1334 *(S. I. I.,* Vol. VII, No. 125).

**[*Maṛavarman Vīra-Pāṇḍya accn. A. D. 1420 : his titles  
‘ Kaiyugarāman’ and ‘Tirunelvēlipperumāḷâ€™.*](cn2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
35. Two inscriptions (Nos. 181 and 183) from Tiruppaṅgili in the Trichinopoly district belong to the 29th year of Kōnērinmaikoṇḍān and record endowments of villages for the expenses of the service, ‘ Kaliyugarāman-śandi’ instituted by the king in his name in the temple. He also calls himself ‘ Tirunelvēli-uḍaiyār’. No. 182 from the same place, registering a memorandum issued by the king in his 29th year from Vīradhā-vaḷam (see para. 8 above) is also connected with the above two inscriptions. All these epigraphs are engraved in characters which may be assigned to the 15th century A.D. We know that Māravarman Vīra-Pāṇḍya (Ep. Rep. 1905, p. 48) of accn. A. D. 1420 bore the surname ‘ Kaliyugarāman’ and Tirunelvēlipperumāḷ’ and hence it is not impossible that these records also belong to this king. It has however to be noted that his inscriptions have not hitherto been found so far north as Trichinopoly. A certain Māravarman Vīra-Pāṇḍya however, with the title ‘ Kaliyugarāman’ is mentioned in two inscriptions from the South Arcot district (A. R. Nos. 281 and 282 of 1928-29), but the omission therin of the surname ‘ Tirunelvēli-Uḍaiyār’ would seem to preclude his identification with the king of the present inscriptions.
