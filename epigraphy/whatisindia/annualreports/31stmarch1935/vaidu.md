**THE VAIDUMBAS**

[***Irigaya-Maharaja (A. D. 976)***](cnt2.html#_ftnref1100)  
21. Of the Vaidumba family, there are two inscriptions coming from Animala in the Cuddapah district. No 191 which is highly damaged may be attributed to the 9th century A.D. It belongs to the reign of **Gaṇḍatriṇētra** and makes referred to Rēnāṇḍu and to a certain **Jaḍa-Chōḷa.** The other record (No. 196) is dated in **Śaka 898** corresponding to A.D. 976, October 6, in the regin of **Irigāya-Mahārāja,** who is stated to have made a gift of land to a certain Sūryakramadhāḷḷu as *ēkōddishṭa-bhukta-dakshiṇā,* apparently on the occasion of his father Beja\[yi\]-Mahārāja’s obsequies. If this is so, the date of **Vidumba** **Vijayāditya’s** death must have been **A.D. 976,** September 26. The chief named Irigāya-Mahārāya who figures in an undated record (No. 290 of 1905) from Madanapalle in the Chittoor district relating to the death of a hero in some frontier fight must be identical with the chief of the present inscrip tion, but as the Madanapalle record is much damaged it is not possible to know any details about him. From some Tamil records in the Tirukkoyilur taluk (South Arcot) it is learnt that Tiruvaiyan son of Vikramāditya and his son Śrīkaṇṭha were the Vaidumba vassals of the Rāshṭrakūṭa king Kṛishṇa III in A.D. 962 and 963 corresponding to the 23rd and 24th regnal years of the king (see para. 19 above). If Vijayāditya and his son Iṛigaya belonged to the main Vaidumba line, and were different from the above-named chiefs, they must have ruled over portions of the Vaidumba territory to the north of Toṇḍai-maṇḍalam in the Cuddapah and Chittoor districts. It may also be remembered in this connection that between Śrīkaṇṭha who figures in the record of the 25th year of Kannara (Kṛishṇa III ; A.D. 963) and his brother Śaṅkaradēva who occurs in the 16th year of Rājarāja (A.D. 1003 ; S. I. I., Vol. III, No. 51), there is an interval of 40 years during which period the date of the present record falls.
