**THE VIJAYANAGARA KINGS**

at Hemakūṭa, he gave to **Timmā-Bhaṭṭa,** son of Tippā-Bhaṭṭa of the Vāsishṭha gōtra and several other Brahmans of various *gōtras,* shares in the village called Śēṭṭṭūru renamed Kṛishṇarāyapura in the Rāyadurga-sīma. The composer of The grant was Sabhāpati and the engraver was Vīraṇa, son of Mallaṇa.

**[*The eight poets (known as the Ashṭadiggajas) of his court.*](cnt3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 Of the stone records of the king, No. 282 from Tippalūru in the Cuddapah district dated in Śaka 1430 (wrong for 1450) is of interest as it refers to the **‘ Ashṭa- diggaja-kavīśvarulu’,** or the eight famous poets who flourished in the king’s court, to whom the village Tippalūr had already been granted as an *agrahāra.* It is stated in the inscription that when Kumaragiri-Reḍḍi and Kūtari Sūraparāju, two leaders of the Dommari community, were staying at this village, they made over the *dommaripannu* tax due from the *agrahāra* to the 24 families of their community, for worship and offerings in the temples of Śiva and Vishṇu for the merit of these families and of the king. The eight famous poets of Kṛishṇarāya’s court are traditionally known to have been Allasāni Peddana, Nandi Timmana, Ayyalarāju Rāmabhadra, Dhūrjaṭi, Mādayyagāri Mallayya, Piṅgaḷi Śūrana, Rāmarājabhūshaṇa and Tenāli Rāmakṛishṇa.

**[*Saptasagara-tirtha at Madura.*](cnt3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 Of the other inscriptions of the king, a Sanskrit verse (No. 120) engraved on a jamb of the Nānmugan-gōpura at Śrīraṅgam records that the doors of this *gōpura* were plated with gold in the Śaka year 1448, expressed by the chronogram *jīvadvākyē* while another verse in the same record mentions that a certain Īśvara of the Bhāradvāja-gōtra, and the brother of one Ananta gave to the god Raṅganātha a circular *pīṭha* and a footstool in the same year expressed differently by the chronogram dēvabhōgyē. Two records from Elavānāśūr (Nos. 494 and 495) mention **Vāśal Mallapa-Nāyaka** and his four sons Timmappa- Nāyaka, Ādiyappa-Nāyaka, Channappa-Nāyaka and Mallappa-Nāyaka, some of whom already figure in other records (No. 182 of 1992, No. 230 of 1927 and No. 246 of 1916). A certain Rāmaiyar, son of Vasava-Nāyaka, was the agent of Chinnappa-Nāyaka noted above in the tract of country round about Iraivānaraiyūr. Among the taxes leviable from this village are mentioned some new ones such as *śārkall-āyam, karuvip-paṇam, and tirikai-āyam.* No. 494, dated in Śaka 1442 Timmappa-Nāyaka, one of these sons, is said to have halted at Tillasthānam on the banks of the Kāvērī during a lunar eclipse, when he restored the gift of the village Śembiyanmahādēvi free of taxes to the Śiva temple at Elavānāśūr in Tirumunaippāḍi which was his *nāyakattanam.* Another record (No. 161) engraved on a slab buried underground near the Ēlukaḍal- tīrtham at Madura which is dated in Śaka 1438, Dhātu, states that the **Saptasāgara-tīrtham** in front of the Chokkanātha temple was constructed by Sāḷuva Narasā-Nāyaka Narasayan, whose identity is not clear.

**[*Achyutarāya—his officer Vīrapaṇṇa.*](cnt3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 70. King **Achyutarāya** is represented by a few copper-plate records and about a dozen stone inscriptions. The copper-plate grants come from Lēpākshi in the Anantapur district, which rose to importance during the Vijayanagara times. This village consisted of two divisions, the old and the new, the old being now almost deserted. The Vīrabhadra temple here, whose construction is connected with the name of **Vīrapaṇṇa of Penukoṇḍa,** an officer who was apparently in charge of this locality during the reign of this king, is a fine monument of the Vijayanagara period. The stone inscriptions copied from this temple (Nos. 88 to 90 and 569to 583 of 1912) were almost all of them issued during the reign of king Achyutarāya and record endowments made at the instance of this officer Vīrapaṇṇa. Some local legends connecting this temple with the name of Vīra-paṇṇa are recorded in the *Anantapur District Gazetteer,* page 172. Of the copper-plate grants belonging to him, No. 19 which is dated in Śaka 1463, Plava, towards the end of the king’s reign is of interest, as it gives a complete version of the king’s historical introduction, in which are included the Sanskrit verse describing his gift of *muktā-tulābhāra* in Śaka 1454 at Kāñchīpuram, the *svarṇamēru* in Śaka 1455 at Hampi, and the *ānandanidhi* in Śaka 1461 at the same place, copied of which are independently found engraved in several temples in the Vijayanagara dominions. The object of the present record is to register a grant of the village Sirivara inclusive of the suburbs Mañchenahaḷḷi and Māyināyakahaḷḷi in
