**THE EASTERN CHALUKYAS**

the text of the grant in the *Journal of the Andhra Historical Research Society*. Vol. XI, p. 80.

**[*Amma II─his subordinate Mādiya-Dēśaraṭṭōḍi.*](cnt.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 13. Another grant of this family is that of king **Amma (II) Vijayāditya VI,M** son of Vishṇuvardhana (C. P. No. 7), which is dated in the **10th year** of the regin (A. D. 955-6). It records the grant of the village **Ponduvugrāma** in Attilināṇḍu- vishaya-Seventy along with the title *Mahāsāmanta,* to a subordinate of the king named **Mādiya-Dēśaraṭṭōḍi,** son of Kallikiya-Dēśaraṭṭōḍi and grandson of Mādiya-Raṭṭōḍi, in appreciation of his valour in the king’s service. The title carried with it the privileges of *śivadvāra (?) (cf. maṅgala-tōraṇa), mayūrapiñchha (peacock feather), vyajana (fan), pīli (?), karkari,* golden betel-tray, the privilege of tying plantain trees to pillars (before his residence) and of hunting.

 C. P. No. 8 received from the Secretary of the Andhra Historical Research Society Rajahmundry, also belongs to the same king. It is an unfinished record and registers the grant of a village (?) in **Lechchādi-vishaya in Bārupu-nāṇḍu,** a subdivision of Elamañchi-Kaliṅga to a certain Kūchana. It has been published in the *Journal of the Andhra Historical Research Society* (Vol. II, p. 242).

**[*Rajaraja I.*](cnt.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 14. C. P. No. 5 which was received for examination from Dr. N. Venkatara- manayya of the Madras University is a very interesting document of the time of (the Eastern Chāḷukya king) After giving the description of the family up to Rājarāja, it eulogises the Chōḷa king Rājēndra-Chōḍa *alias* Madhurāntaka, whose daughter Ammaṅgā was given in marriage to Rājarāja as his chief queen. It registers a grant made by the king, of the newly formed village Kalidiṇḍigrāma *alias* Madhurāntakanallūr, for the maintenance of a feeding house to feed 50 students of *śāstras* and for conducting worship in three Śiva temples constructed by him in the village in memory of the *Daṇḍanāyaka* **Rājarāja RājaBrahmamahārāja** and two other officers named **Uttamachōḍa-Chōḍakōn and Uttamachōḍa-Milāḍuḍaiyān.** These are stated to have been sent at the king’s request by his maternal uncle the Chōḷa king Madhurāntaka (also called) RājēndraChōḷa at the head of a large army against the forces of the Karnāṭa king and lost their lives in the encounter.

**[*Temples erected in memory of three Chōḷa generals.*](cnt.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 their lives in the encounter. The fight is graphically described in the inscription. The Karnāṭa king referred to here seems to be identical with the Western Chāḷukya Jayasiṁha II, the contemporary and enemy of Rājēndra-Chōḷa I. Though the inscription is not dated specifically, it seems to have been issued shortly after the king’s accession to the throne in Śaka 944 (A. D. 1022). **Kalidiṇḍi** is evidently identical with the village of the name in the Kaikalur taluk of the Kistna district, and Gudrahāra-vishaya in which it was situated seems to have been called after Gudrahāra, the present Guḍivāḍa in the same district. The construction of the temples and the provision for worship therein by grants of lands in the village seem to indicate that the battle might have taken place somewhere in the vicinity of the village.
