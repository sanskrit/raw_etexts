**THE EASTERN CHALUKYAS**

Arumbāka grant, However gives a reign of 7 years to Yuddhamalla II while our grant merely states that it was a period of confusion at the end of which Vikramāditya succeeded after driving out Yuddhamalla. Chāḷukya-Bhīma II’s son by Lōkamahādēvī was Amma II, who after being crowned while still young, was in turn ousted by Bādapa, the son of Yuddhamalla II. Amma II is stated in the other Arumbāka grant to have ruled both the Vēṅgi country and Tri kaḷiṅga and to have been forced in to exile by Bādapa with the help of Karṇarāja-Vallabha (Kṛishṇa III), facts which are both omitted in the present grant.

 This Badapa ruled the kingdom with the help of his faithful younger brother Tālapa, when he made a grant to his venerable minister Māveṇaśarman of the Kuṇḍina-gōtra of the village of Intēru. Probably identical with the present Itēru in the Bapatla taluk of the Guntur district, for being given in turn to his son who bore the king’s father’s name Yuddhamalla or Malla. No date is given in the present grant. But from the Māṅgallu plates (Ep. Report for 1917, para 24) of Amma II it can be surmised that the **usurpation of Bādapa took place in the 11th year after the coronation of Amma II (i.e.) in A. D. 957** and the present charter might have been issued shortly thereafter.
