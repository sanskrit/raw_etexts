**THE PALLAVAS**

**[*Dantivarman.*](cnt2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
22. The earliest Pallava inscription in the collection is a fragmentary record of **Dantivarman** dated in the **9th year,** coming from Tinnanūr in the Chingleput districts (No. 168). It mentions the *sabhā* of Ninravūr which was evidently the old name of the village (Tiruninravūr) which has become the modern Tinnanūr. This Ninravūr should be identical with the village of the same name mentioned in No. 176 of 1930. from, Piḷḷaippākkam in the same taluk, which registers a regulation framed by the assembly of Ninravūr. The slab on which this latter record is engraved had apparently belonged to this village and may have later found its way to Piḷlaippākkam.

**[*Nandivarman III.*](cnt2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 23. **Nandivarman III,** the successor of Dantivarman, is represented by four inscriptions (Nos. 162, 188, 467, and 469) ranging in date from the 5th to the 23rd years of his regin, of these, No. 162 from Tiruvorriyūr near Madras, dated in the **18th year** is important as no inscription of this king has been found so far north as Tiruvorriyūr, and it is also the earliest epigraph found in the village This inscription in which the king is distinguished by the title ‘Teḷḷārrerinda’ registers an agreement made by the assembly of Nandiyambākkam in Nāyaru-nāḍu to burn two lamps before the god at Tiruvorriyūr with the interest on 105 *kalañju* of gold presented by the king. The village Nandiyambākkam must have been so called after this Pallava king, and it may be identified with the village of the same name near Nāyar in the Ponneri taluk of the Chingleput district.

**[*His vassal Vikramāditya Mahābali-Bāṇarāya.*](cnt2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 In this connection it may be remarked that all the early inscriptions of different dynasties found in the Ādhipurīśvara temple at Tiruvorriyūr belonging to Nripatuṅga, Kampa Aparājita, Kannara and Parāntaka I are found engraved on dressed granite slabs, most of which are now found embedded in the pavement on the east sides of the second prākāra. The varying sizes of these slabs and the way in which the records are incised in short line cross the breadth of the slabs, as well as the fact that the central shrine was built of black granite in the time of Rājēndra-Chōḷadēva I, seem to indicate that they could not have formed part of the
