**[Srivallabha.](contents3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
58.**Srivallabha** is represented by three inscriptions (Nos. 148, 149 and 172) all of which come from the Ramnad district. Expect in one inscription (No. 172) where he is called Jaṭāvarman, the king bears no distinguishing epithets which would help in his-identification. The palaeography of No.. 172 would point to the king who came to the throne in A.D. 1291. We learn from this that a certain Brahman lady having died by taking poison for some unspecified reason, allegations were made against her husband which subsequently proved unfounded Thereupon in expiation of this calumny, the *Kaikkōḷas,* residing in the *tirumaḍaiviḷāgam* of the god Tiruttaiḷyāṇḍa-Nāyanār presented as *udirappaṭṭi* to Sundara-Pāṇḍya-Bhaṭṭa, the husband of the deceased, a plot out of the *dēvadna* land belonging to the temple, which was obtained in exchange for their own lands from the *Mūlaparishad-mahāsabhā and the muppaduvaṭṭattu-kāṇiyāḷar* of the temple. The document is signed by the temple accountant Alagiya Perumāḷ Ambalattāḍuvān alias Āyirattelunūrruvan- Mūvēṅdavēḷāṇ. Of the other two inscriptions of Śrīvallahbha, which appears to belong to a king of this name of the 12th century A.D., No. 148 mentions a hostility between two parties which involved the death of a certain Kāḍan Kēraḷan and the cessation of the hostility between them, which was signified by a grant of 2 *mā* of land for offerings to god Tiruvīṅgaikuḍi-Mahādēva in the name of the deceased. No. 149 appears to be connected with No. 148, in continuation of which it is engraved.

**[Māravarman Tribhuvanachakravartin Vīra-Pāṇḍya (A.D. 1334).](contents3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
59. **Maravarman Tribhuvanachakravartin Vīra-Pāṇḍya** is represented by a single inscription from Chidambaram (No. 5). It is dated in his 12th regnal year and registers an order of Kappalūru¬ḍaiyān Vāṇādarāyan issued to the authorities of the temple of Tiruchchirrambalamuḍaiyār directing the latter to engrave on their temple walls a grant of land made by Āṭkoṇḍān *alias* Nārāyaṇadēvan Pallavarāyar of Iḷāṅguḍi *alias* Indrāvatāranallūr in Tenvallattirukkai situated in Pāṇḍi-maṇḍalam, for rearing a flower-garden.

60. Six inscriptions attributable to **Maravaraman Parakrama-Pandya** come from Māriṅgiyūr in the South Arcot district. Of these, No. 92 dated in the 7th year  
**[Māravarman Parākrama-Pāṇḍya (A.D. 1334).](contents3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
of his reign registers a gift of land by Karumāṇikkadēvan Yādavarāyan Kāliṅgrāyar of Kappalūr alias Ulagaḷandaśōla-nallūr in Muttūrr-kukūrram, a subdivision of Pāṇḍi-maṇḍalam, for conducting a śandi instituted in his name in the temple of Tiruvirāmīśvaram-uḍaiya-Nāyanār at Māriṅgūr and for daily worship and offerings to the god. In the same temple another *śandi* called **Parākrama-Paṇḍyan-śandi** was instituted, for which the village Māriṅgūr *alias* Rājēndraśiṅganallūr was granted in the 18 . . 9th year, evidently of Parākrama-Pāṇḍya (No. 95). On this occasion the temple authorities bestowed the stewardship in the temple on an *āndār* of Tiruveṇṇaillūr called Būdanūr-uḍaiyān Taluvakkulainjān Taḍuttāṭkondān and the *maṭha* called *Inakkunallaperumāl*ḷ *Dēvēndravallabha-Brahmādirāyan-maṭha’* where he has to arrange for the singing of the sacred hymns. Two other records from the same place (Nos. 102 and 94) dated in the 18— 3rd year of Kōnērinmaikoṇḍān refer to the institution of a *śandi* called *Muḍimannarnāyan-śandi* after the name of the king, in the temple of Tiruvirāmīśvaramuḍaiya-Nāyanār and to a *maṭha* constructed  
**[Muḍimannarnāyan probably his surname.](contents3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
in the *sannidhi* street of the god. It is not explicit who the king was, that bore the title **Muḍimannar-nayan,** though the dating in the records suggests that it might refer to Māravarman Parākrama-Pāṇḍya. Of these No. 102 also states that the *māḍāpatyam* of this temple was given to a certain Toṇḍan Tyāgapperumāḷ Peṇṇāgiya-Perumān of Śirrāmūr in Iruṅgōḷappāḍi-nāḍu. No. 97 from the same place dated in 18 . . 9th year of Kōnērinmaikoṇḍāṇ may also be assigned to this **Parakrama-Pandya.**
