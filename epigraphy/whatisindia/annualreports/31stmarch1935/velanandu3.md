**THE VELANANDU CHIEFS**

Saka 1123. Since Pṛithvīśvara was the ruling chief in Śaka 1108 as stated in his Piṭhāpuram inscription (*Ep. Ind.,* Vol. IV, p. 32), his father Goṅka III must have had a short rule of four to five years only between Śaka 1103 and 1108. Thus the chronology of the above-mentioned Velanāṇḍu chiefs may be set forth roughly in the following table :â€”

Goṅka I.  
Śaka 998 ; Śaka 1028 (No. 277 of 1905).  
Chōḍa or Rājēndrachōḍa-Gāṅgēyarāja  
Śaka 1039 (No. 219 of 1935-36) ;  
Śaka 1058 (S. I. I. Vol. V, No. 161) ;  
Goṅka II.  
Śaka 1050─1079.  
Rājēndrachōḍa or Velanāṇṭi  
Kulōttuṅga Rājēndra-Chōḍa  
Śaka 1085─1102  
Goṅka III.  
Śaka 1103─c.1108  
Pṛithvīśvara  
c. Śaka 1108─1123

**[*Its subordinate position under the Kākatīyas after Śaka 1123.*](cont.html#_ftnref1100)**  
15. No. 322 found on a mutilated Nandi-pillar in front of the Narēndrēśvara temple at Peddapulivarru in the Repalle taluk is record of Velanāṇṭi-Chōḍa, who is stated to have presented rich spoils of war to the temple of Bhīmēśvara at Drākshārāma. The inscription is badly damaged and the name and exploits of his father who appears to have ruled over the ‘ Fifty-lakh Andhra country’ cannot be made out. In the latter part of the inscription which is also similarly damaged occurs, with reference to the chief, the expression *Gaṇapati-kshitīśaṁ saṁsēvya* which testifies to the **subordinate position of the Velanāṇḍu chiefs** under the Kākatīyas after Śaka 1123, as stated above. The Śaka date of the present epigraph is expressed by the chronogram *‘ \[sō\]m-ēshu-rudra-gaṇitē’, i.e.,* Śaka \[1\]151, which falls during the reign of Kākatīya Gaṇapati, to whom the chief paid allegiance. The present epigraph thus furnishes a date 8 years earlier than the earliest known date for him, i.e., Śaka 1159 (S. I. I., Vol. IV, No. 1333), and brings the interval between Pṛithvīśvara, the last independent chief of the family, and Velanāṇṭi-Chōḍa of the inscription under review, into a narrow compass of within 30 years, which were perhaps covered by the reigns of himself and his father, whose name is lost in the record.
