****EASTERN GANGAS****

the king’s stone inscriptions at Mukhaliṅgam, it appears as if the king actually assumed power some years earlier. Nearly two-thirds of his records at Mukhaliṅgam seem to point to Śaka 996 as the date of his accession. It is reasonable to infer therefore that he came to power in A.D. 1074 and was associated with his father during the last days of the latter’s reign as *Yuvarāja* and co-regent for at least four years. Dr. Hultzsch had noted the king’s latest date to be the 72nd year only *(Ep.* Rep. for 1896, p. 6, para 20). But from an inscription at Mukhaliṅgam (S.I.I., Vol. V, No. 1018), which belongs to Śaka 1072 and is dated in his 75th regnal year, it is evident that Chōḍagaṅga enjoyed sovereignty for a remarkably long period three-quarters of a century.

In the matter of interpreting the date of the Gāra inscription of king Dēvēndravarman (No. 391 of 1932-33) which is give by the rather unusual chronogram *sara-sūrya-raśmi* and assigned by me to Śaka 1005 (i.e., 5 and 1000) (Ep. Rep. for 1932-33, p. 56, para. 9), Dr. Chakravarti has suggested that the interpretation of *raśmi* must be Chandra *(i.e., 1)* but at the same time recognised the difficulties in the way of adopting this interpretation definitely in the particular case *(ibid*. p. 57, fn. 1). Attention may be drawn in this connection to an inscription from Mukhaliṅgam (S.I.I., Vol. V, No. 1139) which reads Śākābdē pañcha-shasṭy-adhikā-ravikiraṇē where the only interpretation possible for ravikiraṇa is 1000 and the date has to be taken as Śaka 1065. Similarly in another inscription from the same locality (S.I.I., Vol. V, No., 1126) the date given as śākābdēnayan-ārkaraśmi-gaṇitē must accordingly be taken to be Śaka 1002 and not 1122.
