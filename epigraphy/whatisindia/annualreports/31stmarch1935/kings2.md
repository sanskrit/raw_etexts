**THE IKHAKU KINGS**

constructed (?) for the use of the *Saṁgha* of the venerable Buddha, a stūpa *(tuva)* in the village *(gama),* in conjunction with his wife, sons, friends and relatives (?) and set up a pillar in the stone-chamber (?) there, for the increase of his life and prosperity. As the stone is broken and damaged towards the bottom, the record cannot be completely made out. The inscription seems to contain a reference to the Khaṇḍagiri hill in Orissa in the expression ‘ Khadagiri-vadha. . . . . . . . .â€™

**[*Mūlāvāsa-Chētiya at Amarāvati.*](cont.html#_ftnref1100)**  
12. Next in chronological order come the two Brāhmī inscriptions (Nos. 329- 30) of about the 3rd century A.D., found on the outer *prākāra* wall of the Amarēśvara temple at Amarāvati in the Sattenapalle taluk of the Guntur district. The former refers to the *Mahāchētiya* and seems to record a gift made to by a house-holder *(gahapati)* of the Vērakīyas, whose name is lost. The other inscription records a gift made by **Vēra-Dāsa,** a *Sēṭhi* (banker), for the benefit of *Thēra* Chitaka of the **Mūlāvāsa-Chētiya.** It may be noted that the Mahāchētiya or Mūlāvāsa- Chētiya mentioned in the two epigraphs evidently refers to the Buddhist temple at Amarāvati and that the Vēraka or Vēra\* was a Buddhist clan not hitherto met with in inscriptions. It is interesting to note here that according to the *Mūshikavaṁśa* extracted in the *Travancore Archaeological Series,* Vol. II, p. 123, Mūlāvāsa was the name of an ancient Buddhist centre near Ambalappula in Travancore territory, and that it was held in great sanctity by the Buddhists all over the world in the early centuries of the Christian era. This is borne out by the short inscription on the image of Lōkanātha found in Gāndhāra which reads *‘ Dakshiṇāpathē Mūlāvāsa Lōkanātha ’ (Foucher, Budddhist Iconography,* part I, p. 105, pl. IV, No. 5 and *Trav. Arch. Series¸* Vol. II. p. 117). The Amarāvati inscription under review furnishes the **earliest epigraphical reference to Mūlāvāsa** which probably lent its sanctifying name to the *Mahāchētiya* of the place.
