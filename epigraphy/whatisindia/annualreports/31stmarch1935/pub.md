For the next volume of Tamil inscriptions introductory notes for 250 inscriptions of the Pallava section were revised and got ready for the press and about 100 inscriptions of the Pāṇḍya and Chōḷa dynasties were also studied. For the *Bombay-Karnatak* volume, 62 pages of corrected third proof and 32 pages of 2nd proof sent to press for revise and 180 pages of manuscript sent for being set up.

 The second and the third stitched proofs of the *Annual Report* for 1932-33 were revised and sent to press and the *Report* was issued in September 1936. The typescript of the *Annual Report* for 1933-34 which had been sent to press early in February 1936 was taken up for printing only after the publication of the previous *Report.* The first proof of this was corrected and returned in March 1937. The typescript of the *Annual Report* for 1934-35 which had also been got ready could not be taken up for printing by the Madras Press simultaneously with that for 1933-34, and hence the material was submitted to the Controller of Printing in February 1937 for being printed at the Government of India Press, Calcutta.
