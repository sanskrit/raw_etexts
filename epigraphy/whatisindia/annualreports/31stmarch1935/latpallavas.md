**LATER PALLAVAS**

**[*Peruñjiṅgadēva—two chiefs of the name.*](cont2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
35. Peruñjiṅgadēva is represented by only four inscriptions in this year (Nos. 185, 186, 199 and 275) and they come from Villiyanūr near Pondicherry and Parikkal in the South Arcot district. Of these the most important is No. 186 from Villiyanūr, which confirms the surmise made by the late Mr. Venkayya as early as 1906 ‘ that there must have been two or more chiefs with the name Kōpperuñjiṅga’ (Ep. Rep. for 1906, p. 63). This inscription is dated in the 6th year of Sakalabhuvanachchakravarttigaḷ Avaniyāḷappirandān Kōpperuñjiṅgadēva, and records that Uḍaiyār Udaiyapperumāḷ *alias* Kāḍuveṭṭigaḷ of Perumaṅgalam audited the accounts of the temple of Tirukkāmīśvaram-Uḍaiyār at Villiyanallūr, the western hamlet of Olugarai *alias* Kulōttuṅgaśōlanallūr for the period commencing from the 37th year of Tribhuvanavīradēva (i.e., Kulōttuṅga III) to the 11th year of Alagiyaśīyar Kōpperuñjiṅgadēva, and finding that 64 cows 2 bulls had to be accounted for by the *Śivabrāhmaṇas,* he insisted on their maintaining two perpectual lamps in that temple. Since the present inscription dated in the 6th year of Sakalabhuvanachchakravarttigaḷ Avaniyāḷappirandān Kōpperuñjiṅgadēva quotes a higher regnal year, namely the 11th year of an Alagiyaśīyar Kōpperuñjiṅgadēva, these two chiefs must be different. It is therefore evident that there must have been two chiefs of the name Kōpperuñjiṅga, one the father with the name of Alagiyaśīyar and the other his son. This is in consonance with the information contained in the Tripurāntakam inscription of Mahārājasimha (Kōpperuñjiṅgadēva II) (No. 197 of 1905) that his father was Jīyamahīpati had a reign of at least 11 years. This does not, however, preclude the possibility of his having had a longer reign. Of the numerous records of Peruñjiṅga, therefore, the attribution of some of them to one or the other chief has to be done with caution, from the meagre internal evidence available in them.

No. 185 from the same temple dated in the 8th year of Peruñjiṅgadēva (II), mentions that some *tiruppaṇi* in stone was accomplished in the temple and *maṇḍapa* in that year by Vīdiviṭaṅkan Tiruchirrambalam-uḍaiyān *alias* Nandiyarāyan, the headman of Kōṭṭūr in Pūṅgunram. Since we find an inscription (No. 189 of 1902) dated in the 13th year, probably of Kulōttuṅga I or II in the same temple, the *tiruppaṇi* referred to must have been only a renovation, the old inscriptions having been left intact.

 An inscription dated in the 22nd year of Peruñjiṅgadēva from Parikkal in the South Arcot district (No. 275) records the construction of four tiers of the *jagatippaḍai* of the temple of Tiruvagnīśvaramuḍaiya-Nāyanār at Perukkal in Mēlūrnāṭṭu Tirumunaippāḍi-nāḍu, a subdivision of Rājarāja-vaḷanāḍu, by Kābiṅgan alias Periyanāṭṭut-taṭṭān, a goldsmith of the village. Owing to the high regnal year quoted in it, it has to be attributed to Peruñjiṅgadeva II.
