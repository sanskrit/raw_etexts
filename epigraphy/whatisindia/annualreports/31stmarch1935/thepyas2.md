**THE PANDYAS**

month quoted here as a similar śandi was instituted to celebrate the king’s asterism Aviṭṭam, in the month of Puraṭṭāśi in the Śiva Temple at Tiruvālīśvaram (No. 340 of 1916), and in all months of the year in the Rudrakōṭīśvara temple at Chaturvēdimaṅgalam (No. 303 of 1928). The latest record of this king (No. 30) in the year’s collection is of his 11th year and mentions as donors Vēṇāḍuḍaiyār and his younger brother Maduraipperumāḷ alias Magadarāyar. It is not clear whether this Vēṇāḍuḍaiyār was identical with Araiyan Pūvan alias Vēṇāvuḍaiyār of Kīlaikkoḍumaḷūr mentioned in a record of Māravarman Sundara-Pāṇḍya, II (No. 149 of 1894).

45. Of the records of (Nos. 28, 373 and 492), No. 28 beginning with the introduction *Samasta-jagad-ādhāra,* etc., and therefore assignable to the first king of the name registers a royal remission of taxes made Jaṭāvarman Sundara-Pāṇḍya ; his title ‘Śēranai- at the instance of his brother-in-law *(machchunanār)* Malavarāyar on the villages Muṭṭaipāḍi, Vīratoṅgapuram, and Pāgaṅguḍi in Viḷā-nāḍu, a subdivision of’ Pāṇḍikulapati-vaḷanāḍu for worship and offerings to the god TiruvānaikkāUḍaiyār during the festival called **Śēranai-venrān-tirunāḷ** celebrated in the temple in the name of the king on the day of his asterism Mūlā in the month of Chittirai. The *Śēranai-venrān-maṇḍapa* at Śrīraṅgam should be also attributed to this Pāṇḍya king. As the title ‘Śēranai-venrān’ is applied in the record specifically to this king, the suggestion made in th *Epigraphical Report* for 1926-27, para. 4, that it was possibly a title of Māravarman Kulaśēkhara would have to be modified. The special honours during auspicious and inauspicious occasions granted to the **Pāraśivas** (Pāraśavas) attached to the temple at Elavānāśūr in the South Arcot are district mentioned in No. 492 of the 13 + 3rd year of a Jaṭāvarman Sundara- Pāṇḍya. There were vouchsafed in a vyavasthā-patra granted by the tānattār of the temple of Ūrbāgaṅkoṇḍaruḷiya-Nāyanār extending to them the same privileges as were then obtaining in Pāṇḍi-maṇḍalam, Śōla-maṇḍalam, Magala-maṇḍalam and at Tirumudukuram, Tiruvāmāttūr, Tiruvadigai and Tiruveṇṇainallūr in Naḍuvil- maṇḍalam. A similar privilege granted to this community is also recorded in an inscription at Tiruvēndipuram, in the same district, which is dated in the same 13 + 3rd year of a ‘Māravarman’ Sundara-Pāṇḍya (No. 141 of 1902). Uniformity was sought to be effected in according temple honours to the **Pāraśivas** in the regions specified above, which nearly covered the whole of the Tamil country. According to the *Manusmṛiti,* the Pāraśava was an *anulōmaja,* being the offspring of a Brahman father and a Śūdra mother.

**[*His subordinate Vīranārasiṅgadēva-Yādavaraya.*](cnt2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 46. A damaged record of Sundara-Pāṇḍya without any distinguishing title and dated in the 11 +1st year, coming from Kuntrapākkam in the Chittoor district (No. 186) registers a gift of land for offerings and worship to the god Tiruvagattīśvaramuḍaiya-Nāyanār evidently of this village, situated in Tiruvēṅgaḍa-kōṭṭam, a district of Jayaṅ- goṇḍaśōla-maṇḍalam by the **Yādava chief Vīra-Nāraśiṅgadēva.** As there are no inscriptions of any other Sundara-Pāṇḍya prior to Jaṭāvarman Sundara-Pāṇḍya I in this region, this record may be attributed to him. The Yādavarāya were a family of feudatory chiefs figuring in Chōḷa inscriptions from the time of Kulōttuṅga III to about the 15th year of Rājarāja III, when they seem to have asserted their independence and issued records in their own name. In para. 42 above it is supposed that there must have been more than one chief bearing the name Vīrā-Nārasiṁha, and the chief mentioned in the present record was evidently a later member of that name as district from Vīra-Nārasiṁha figuring in the regin of Kulōtuṅga III (406 of 1896). An inscription from Tirupati (No. 89, *Tirupati Inscriptions,* Vol. I) equates his 50th regnal year with the cyclic year Vikrama corresponding to A. D. 1280, which would give A. D. 1230-31 as the initial year of his independent rule, which seems, however, to have received a temporary set-back in the time of Sundara-Pāṇḍya.

 A slab now set up before the Vēdavyāsa-Bhaṭṭar-*tirumāḷigai* in the North Chittirai Street at Śrīraṅgam, contains an inscription (No. 122) belonging to the reign of **Perumāḷ Sundara-Pāṇḍya.** On the top of this slab is elaborately sculptured the Pāṇḍya emblem which consists of a pair of carps with two elephant goads between them. In the middle is also sculptured the Vaishṇava emblem of a *Chakra* surmounting a pillar, with an umbrella and a pair of *chauris* over it. This damaged record seems to indicate that the *maṭha* was probably
