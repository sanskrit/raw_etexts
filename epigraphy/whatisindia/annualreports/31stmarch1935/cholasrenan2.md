**THE CHOLAS OF RENANDU**

**[*Uttamāditya Chōla-Mahārāja.*](cnt.html#_ftnref1100)**  
7. No. 297 which is also from Veldurti belongs to **Uttamāditya Chōla- Mahārāja,** a hitherto unknown member of this family. The inscription registers of gift of *pannavisa (pannasa)* to a certain Chēdiśarma, a Kōsiyapāra *i.e.,* a Brahman of the Kauśika-gōtra. Vikramāditya Chōla-Mahārāja, Chōla-Mahārājādhirāja Vikramāditya and Śaktikomāra Vikramāditya are some other chief of this family already known to us *(Ep. Ind.,* Vol. XI, p. 343).

**[*Chōla-Mahārāja Jaḍa-Chōli..*](cnt.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 8. No. 303 from Miḍutūru opens with the characteristic eulogy *Haridurdha- ravara,* etc., of the Telugu Chōlas and introduces the ,king **Jaḍa-Chōli-Mahārāja** who also bears the epithet **Chōla-Mahārāja.** A fragmentary inscription at Conjeevaram mentions a Jaṭā-Chōḍa-Bhīma and his exploits, and the date of this record has been read as Śaka 923 (A D. 1001-2) *(Ep. Ind.,* Vol. XXI, p. 29). The present inscription which is assignable on palæographical considerations to about 950 A. D. is, in all probability, a record of the predecessor, possibly the father of Jaṭā-Chōḍa Bhīma of the Conjeevaram record.
