**THE MADURA NAYAKAS**

**[*His officer Vaḍamalaiyappa-Pivai.*](cont3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
**Vaḍamalaiyappa-Piḷḷai,** an officer in the time of Chokkanātha, is mentioned in No. 170 from Nenmani in the Sattur taluk of the Ramnad district, which states that a certain Vatsavāy Kastūrirāja made a gift of the village Tāmaraikkuḷam for the merit of Chokkanātha-Nāyaka and Vaḍamalaiyappa-Piḷḷai, for providing worship to god Tiruvēṅkaṭanāthasvāmi at Nenmani *alias* Kṛishṇāpuram in Iruṅgōḷa-vaḷanāḍu. This Vaḍamalaiyappa figures in several records of this Nāyaka king and is also referred to in the Tamil poem *Pulavarārruppaḍai* of Śiriya-Ratnakavirāyar. He is therein stated to have been the son of Iruvappan of Śaṅkaranāyanārkōyil and to have been the chief of Iraśai *(Trav. Archl, Series,* Vol. V, p. 199 and App. A). He was different from Vaḍaimalai-Aṇṇagaḷ who lived in the time of the Vijayanagara king Kṛishṇadēvarāya.

 Muddammagāru, wife of Raṅgakṛishṇa Muddu-Vīrappa-Nāyaka is mentioned in Nos. 3 and 4 from Śrīraṅgam, as having made a gift of two gold crowns to the god and of two villages Iśanaikura and Nāṇakura to a certain Śrīnivāsayya for maintaining a *Rāmānūjakūṭam,* while provision for the performance of worship and *Sahasranāmārchanā* of the god appears to have been made through a certain Namberumāḷayya.

**[*Queen Maṅgammā, Śaka 1620.*](cont3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 67. A copper-plate grant in the possession of a resident of Śrīraṅgam (C. P. No. 8) belongs to the reign of the dowager-queen **Maṅgammā.** It is dated in Śaka 1620 expressed as 1000,600,20, but the cyclic year quoted viz., Vyaya as well as the other astronomical details are not regular. The record relates to a gift of a small plot of land in Teṅgājji-sīma, i.e., Tenkāśi in the Tinnevelly distrcit, made by the queen to a certain Gaṅgādhara-Udāsi, for providing food to itinerant pilgrims presumably visiting Kurrālam, the famous place of pilgrimage near by, though it is not specifically stated as such in the grant.

**[*Vijayaraṅga-Chokkanatha.*](cont3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 68. Another recipient of land at Iḷañji in the Tenkāśi-sīma was a certain Śivadāsa-Udāsi mentioned in C. P. No. 7 dated in Śaka 1630, who was possibly connected with Gangādhara-Udāsi of land other record, and to whom some land was granted by Kāsi Yellāri-Nāyanigāru, with the permission of Raṅgaśāyi-Nāyanivāru, son of Daḷakarttā Veṅkaṭakṛishṇama-Nāyaka for the conduct of a feeding charity at Kurrālam or probably at Tenkāśi itself for the merit of Vijayaraṅga-Chokkanātha. This famous Daḷavāy Veṅkaṭakrishṇama-Nāyaka was the one who served under Chokkanātha and took part in the war with Tanjore, but who eventually turned traitor and lost his life in A.D. 1686 (Satyanatha-*Nāyakas,* p. 198). The two donee bore the title of *Udāsi,* by which we have to infer that they belonged to a religious order of Śaiva ascetics, probably coming from the north. A *maṭha* called the Udāsi-maṭha at Mēlagaram in the same Tenkāsi taluk was in the charge of a northern ascetic in A.D. 1854 (No. 379 of 1917). To the same Nāyaka ruler Vijayaraṅga-Chokkanātha belongs Copper plates No. 9, dated in Śaka 1644. It mentions the Vijayanagara king Vīra Veṅkaṭapatirāya as ruling from Ghanagiri, and states that Vijayaraṅga-Chokkanātha, grandson of Chokkanātha and son of Raṅgakṛishṇa-Mudduvīrappa, instituted some enquiries about an endowment which had been made by a certain Sūrappa for conducting worship to Sūrap-Piḷḷaiyār and Vīradurgā at Tiruchināppaḷḷi and which had been mismanaged by Chinnapaṇḍāram, apparently the trustee in charge of the Tōyumānavar temple there. He then ordered that the lands be left in change of Mārappa, a descendant of the original donor, so that the services to Sūrap-Piḷḷaiyār and Vīradurgā might be properly continued. Independently of this record, it is learnt that the management of the Tāyumānavar temple was for a long time … charge of the head of a *maṭha* called Maunasvāmiyār-maṭha now located within the temple at Trichinopoly.

**[*A maṭha at Śrīvilliputtūr maintained by barbers.*](cont3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 Copper-plate No. 2 from Śrīvilliputtūr purports to have been issued in the same kings reign. It contains an incorrect preamble in which Hariyaputtrirarāyar, Virūppāchchi-rāyar, Mallikachchirāyar, Nāgaṇa-Nāyaka, Tirumalai-Nāyaka, Anantappa-Nāyaka, Viśvanātha-Nāyaka, Mārappa-Nāyaka, Raṅgakṛishṇa Mudduvīrappa-Nāyaka and Vijayaraṅga-Chokkanātha-Nāyaka are mentioned as ruling from Vijaiyāru (wrong for Vijayanagara). The date given is Śaka 1667, Kali 4846, Akshaya, which is incorrect for Vijayaraṅga-Chokkanātha’s reign. It purports to be an agreement entered into in the presence of the *Talattār* and *Tānattār* of Śrīvilliputtūr by the several barbers of the place, who had built a
