**THE CHOLAS**

28. A large number of inscriptions of this dynasty have been copied during the year, representing almost all the kings from Parāntaka I to RājēndraChōḷa III and furnishing some interesting details about their reigns.

**[*Rajakesarivarman.*](cnt2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
Of the kings merely calling themselves Rājakēsarivarman or Parakēsarivar- man, there are a few epigraphs No. 158 from Turaiyūr in the Trichinopoly district dated in the 5th year of **Rājakēsarivarman** seems to be attributable to **Gaṇdarāditya.** It refers to the reclamation of some land which had lain covered up with sand since the 18th year of Periya-Uḍaiyār by whom is evidently meant the king’s father and predecessor Parāntaka I because of the high regnal year of the king. The money for this appears to have been obtained from one Vāttalai-Kūḍaluḍaiyān Vēḷan Gaṇavadi who had been made to pay for a twilight lamp in the temple in expiation of his sin of having killed Āchchan Śūrri, the headman of Kiḷinallūr. NO 163 which comes from Tiruvorriyūr and which is dated in the 6th year of Rājakēsarivarman has to be assigned to either Gaṇḍarāditya or Sundara-Chōḷa, preferably to the latter whose record dated in the 17th year has been found at Chintāmaṇi, a village close by (No. 18 of 1933-34). It cannot belong to the earlier Rājakēsari Āditya I, as he had not overrun Toṇḍai-maṇḍalam so early as his 6th year. This record registers an endowment made for feeding in the temple a Brahman well-versed in the Vēdas after the mid-day offerings to the deity.

 29. Among the records of Parakēsarivarman without any distinguishing name is No. 446 from Paḷḷīchchandal near Jambai in the South Arcot district. It is incised in rather early characters and is dated in the 21st year and probably belongs to Parāntaka I. It records a gift of land, after its reclamation, as *ērippaṭṭi* for the maintenance of a tank belonging to the **Nāṭṭār-perumbaḷḷi** at Vāḷaiyūr in Vāṇagōppāḍi by a certain Śakkan Vayiri. It is not known to which Jaina temple in the locality the name Nāṭṭār-perumbaḷḷi refers. About a mile from the place where the inscription is found is a Jaina shrine now completely in ruins known as the Śainiyamman (Jainiyamman)-kōyil. Amidst its debris is lying a mutilated stone image of a Tīrthaṅkara and close to the old structure is set up slab with an inscription of the Vijayanagara king Achyutarāya (No. 449),
