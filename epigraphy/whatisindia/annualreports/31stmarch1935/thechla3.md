**THE CHOLAS**

**[*Rajendradeva.*](cnt2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 34. A fragmentary record of his son **Rājēndradēva** (No. 528) which is engraved on loose stones kept in the Vishṇu temple at Śiṅgavaram is dated in the 11th year and 135th day of his reign. It refers to a fatal assault made by a Brahman on another Brahman named Perukkāḷan of Veṇbēḍu and to the penalty imposed on the assailant, of burning a lamp in the temple of which the name is lost. Veṇdēḍu is stated to be a hamlet of Rājēndra-chaturvēdimaṅgalam in Panaiyūrnāḍu.

**[*Rajamahendra.*](cnt2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
35. Of Rājakēsarivarman **Rājamahēndra** there is a sigle inscription (No. 473) dated in his **2nd year,** which comes from Elavānāśūr in the South Arcot district. It contains a short introduction beginning with the word Tirumagaḷ and records an endowment of lands for a flower-garden and for the conduct of a festival in Paṅguni, by Paṭṭālakan Chintāmaṇi *alias* Narēndraśikhāmaṇi- Mūvēndavēḷān, the headman of Karambiyam. Among the boundaries of the land is mentioned a plot called Śrīpattini-Ālvār-tirunandavanam, which suggests that a shrine dedicated to Pattini-Ālvār, the deified heroine of the *Śilappadigāram* had existed at this place.

**[*Virarajendra.*](cnt2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 36. Virarājēndra is represented by two stone inscriptions, one from Tinnanūr (No. 170) in the Chingleput district and the other from Tuḍaiyūr in the Trichino- poly district (No. 160). But the most important of his inscriptions in this collection is a copper-plate grant (C. P. No. 1) secured from the village Chārāla in the Punganur taluk of the Chittoor district. Its existence had been known as early as 1933-34, but its whereabouts could not be definitely located. Subsequently, however, at my request, Rao Saheb V. Totadri Aiyangar, Deputy Superintendent of Police, kindly interested himself in the matter and secured this set for my examination. It consists of 7 oblong plates held together by a ring with a circular seal, which contains in relief, besides the usual Chōḷa royal emblems similar to those found in the Tiruvālaṅgāḍu Plates of Rājēndra-Chōḷa and the Madras Museum Plates of Uttama-Chōḷa, the Sanskrit legend in Grantha characters engraved round its margin. The legend reads :─

Viśvair=viśvambharādhīśair=nnanditair=vvanditam=idam \|  
Śāsanam Vīrarājēndra-Rājakēsarivarmmaṇaḥ \|\|

**[*His Charala Copper-plate grant.*](cnt2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 The records is dated in **Śaka 991,** Saumya, and the **7th year** of the king, The inscription comprises two parts, the Sanskrit portion (in Grantha) and the Tamil. The former contains a long *praśasti* of the Chōḷa dynasty composed by a certain Chandrabhūshaṇa-Bhaṭṭa, which is identical with the eulogy given in the Kanyākumāri inscription of the same king also dated in his 7th year. The Tamil portion gives the historical introduction beginning with *Vīramē tuṇai* etc., and some *birudas* of the king besides recording his military achievements. It registers the gift of the village Chērām (same as Chārāla) *alias* Madhurāntaka- chaturvēdimaṅgalam in Puli-nāḍu, a subdivision of Raṭṭapāḍikoṇḍaśōla-maṇḍalam, on the occasion of the Uttarāyaṇa-saṅkrānti to three Brahman brothers named Śrautriya-Kramavittan, Mundaya-Kramavittan and Pallaya-Kramavittan of the Ātrēya-gōtra and of the lineage of a certain Rishikēśvara (Hṛishīkēśa)-Bhaṭṭa. **This is the only copper-plate record known so far of this king.** The Sanskrit praśasti helps us to fill up the lacunae in the damaged portions of the Kanyākumāri inscription. The Tamil portion here is more elaborate than in the Kanyākumāri record and gives fuller details of the events connected withs his reign. Among them may be mentioned the facts that Vīrarājēndra started on his expedition against (the Western Chāḷukya) king Āhavamalla on the very day of his coronation and that he defeated him in a battle at Kūḍal-Saṅgamam. It also states that Āhavamalla suffered defeat at the hands of the hands of the Chōḷa as many as five times\*.

**[*Kulōttuṅga-Chōḷa I.*](cnt2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 37. Of **Kulōttuṅga-Chōḷa I** there are three inscriptions (Nos. 372, 429 and 430). Of these No. 372 beginning with the introduction *Pugalmādu* etc., is dated in his 31st year. The other two contains no introduction but have to be assigned to him on account of the high regnal years given in them. No. 430, dated in his 46th year records a gift of the *pāḍikāval* taxes due on the village Kuḷamaṅgalam *alias* Vīraśōlanallūr for the *ardhayāma* service in the temple at Jambai by the Kiḷiyūr Malaiyamān chief Śagirayan Anuppūvan *alias* Kulōttuṅgaśōḷa-Malaiyakularāyan. In No. 251 of 1902, dated in the 10th year of Kulōttuṅga I a certain chief Śa\[di\]ran Malaiyan *alias* Rājēndraśōla-Malaiyamān figures, and he was probably the father or elder brother of the chieftain mentioned in the present record dated 36 years later. It is noteworthy that this family of Malaiyamān chiefs of Kiḷiyūr came into prominence as early as the reign of Kulōttuṅga-Chōḷa I.
