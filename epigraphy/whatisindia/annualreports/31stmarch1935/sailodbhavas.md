****SAILODBHAVAS****

**[An old Śailōdbhava copper-plate.](contents2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
18. An old plate of a set belonging to the Śailōdbhava dynasty was obtained from the Raja of Tekkali for my examination during the year under review (No. 4 of App. A). The remaining plates are unfortunately not traceable. The plate measuring 5 ½” by 2 7/8” has a ring-hole on the left margin and weighs 17 tolas. The ring with seal which must have originally held the plates together appears to have been wrenched away from the set causing an opening from the ring-hole on the left side and consequently a letter or two at that place are completely lost or damaged. The plate bears writing on both the sides. The characters are the Nāgarī of the Ganjam variety and closely resemble those of the Pārikud plates of Madhyamarājadēva (Ep. Ind. Vol. XI, pp. 281 ff). Since the first and the last plates are lost, the beginning and the of this single plate are abrupt. It commences with the passage beginning with ‘vāyuphalāṁbu’ found in the Koṇḍeḍḍa and allied grants. The language of the record is Sanskrit verse, though its orthography is full of errors and omissions.

**[Allavarāja a Śailōdbhava king](contents2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
19. The plate gives the following genealogy of the Śailōdbhava kings— Madhyamarāja ; his son Dharmarāja-Mānabhīta ; his son Madhyamarāja II Raṇakshōbha ; his paternal cousin Allavarāja ; his son Madhyamarāja III. The importance of the record lies in carrying the genealogy of the family further by three steps after Dharmarāja-Mānabhīta. Since the inscription is fragmentary we cannot be definite whether the genealogy is carried further than Madhyamarāja III. The text seems to suggest that Madhyamarāja II bore the the surname Raṇakshōbha. In this inscription we get for the first time the name of Allavarāja, the paternal cousin and successor of Madhyamarāja II. He is compared to Dilīpa (not to Śakra as understood by Dr. Haraprasad Sastri : J.B.O.R.S. Vol. IV, p. 162 f). It is not improbable that Mādhava who, as a junior member, occupied the throne by rebelling against his senior relation and was defeated at the foot of the Vindhyas *(Ep. Ind.,* Vol. XIX, p. 266). was a younger brother of Dharmarāja-Mānabhīta and was the father of Allavarāja of our inscription who was the paternal cousin of Madhyamarāja II.

The plate has been edited by Dr. Haraprasad Sastri in the J.B.O.R.S., Vol. IV. The reading of the text given by Dr. Sastri is faulty in some places and requires revision. Mention may be made hero that his reading of the
