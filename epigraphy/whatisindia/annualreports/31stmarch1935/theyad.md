**THE YADAVAS**

**[*Śiṅgaḷadeva.*](cnt2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
55. From Gōranṭḷa in the Kurnool district comes a single record (No. 315) belonging to the Yādava dynasty. It is dated in Śaka 1137, Yuva, corresponding to A. D. 1216, January 25, in the reign of **Śingaḷadēva** (Siṅgaṇa), who ruled during the period A..D.1210-1247. It states that when Mahāpasāyita **Lakshmīdēva-Daṇḍa- nāyaka,** who bore the *biruda* ‘Paśchimarāya Bhōjadēva-diśāppaṭṭa ‘ was governing the locality, the officer *(Sarvādhikāri)* Yindapa-Nāyaka who was in charge of Nalavāḍi-vishaya consecrated the image of Anmēśvaradēva in the name of his father in the temple at Gōraṭa and made a gift of land for worship and offerings therein. A Raṭṭa chieftain of Saundatti who flourished in this period was known as Lakshmīdēva II (c. A. D. 1228), (Fleer, Kan. Dyn., p. 551), but he was perhaps different from the general figuring in the present record, who might be probably identical with Lakshmīdēva figuring in records of Jaitrapāla (B. K. No. 47 of 1937-38 and B. K. No.157 of 1933-34) and in one of Siṅgaṇa himself B.K.No.51 of 1928-29).
