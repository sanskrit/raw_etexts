**THE PANDYAS**

chaturvēdimaṅgalam are all engraved, one in continuation of another, it is possible that all these documents relating to this *agrahāra* were engraved in the 2+1st year of Māravarman Kulasekhara.

**[*Parākrama-Pāṇḍya (A.D. 1334); his uncle Kulaśēkhara Mahābali-Vāṇarayar.*](cont2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 45. Two inscriptions of Parākrama-Pāṇḍya without any distinguishing epithet come from Villiyanūr near Pondicherry (Nos. 187 and 189). No. 189 dated in the 6th year, refers to the institution of a service in the temple of Tirukkāmīśuram- Uḍaiyār at Villiyanallūr, a hamlet of Olugarai *alias* Kulōttuṅgaśōlanallūr in Māttūr-nāḍu, a subdivision of Jayaṅgoṇḍa-śōla-maṇḍalam, by the king’s *ammān* (maternal uncle) **Kulaśēkhara Mahā- bali-Vāṇarāyar** in his own name. The Parākrama-Pāṇḍya of our record is probably to be identified with Māravarman Parākrama-Pāṇḍya, whose initial date, according to No. 113 of 1900, was A.D. 1333-34, since inscriptions of an earlier Jaṭāvarman Parākrama-Pāṇḍya are not found in the South Arcot district. The donor Kulaśē-khara Mahābali-Vāṇarāyan is styled ‘ *Piḷḷai* ‘ in a record of the 26th year (c. 1322 A.D. ) of Jaṭāvarman Vīra-Pāṇḍya (No. 430 of 1907).

**[*Vira-Pāṇḍya, A.D. 1334.*](cont2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 46. A damaged record of Kōnērinmaikoṇḍān from Śrīraṅgam (No. 51) refers to the foundation of a colony called Sundarapāṇḍya-chaturvēdimaṅgalam after the name of the king’s elder brother *(aṇṇālvi).* This record and the subsequent two inscriptions (Nos.52 and 53) which are connected with the present inscrip- tion are signed by Periyān Śōlaimalaichchokkan Toṇḍaimāṇ of Tūñjalūr in Milalai- kūrram, a subdivision of Pāṇḍi-maṇḍalam. The first inscription (No. 51) records a tax-free gift of land by the king to the temple of Vēdanārāyaṇa-Perumāḷ at Tiru- nārāyaṇapuram in Allakarai-nāḍu which is evidently the village of the same name in the Musiri taluk of the Trichinopoly district. A certain Śōlaimalaichchokkan Toṇḍaimān of Aṇikkuḍi in Milalai-kūrram figures as donor in a record of Māra-varman Vīra-Pāṇḍya (No. 27 A of 1903 ; S. I. I., Vol. VIII, No. 300) of the initial year A.D. 1334. If he is the same as the donor in our records we may assign these (Nos. 51, 52 and 53) also to the same **Vīra-Pāṇḍya,** who, as stated above (No. 51), **had an elder brother named Sundara-Pāṇḍya.**
