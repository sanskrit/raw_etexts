**THE LATER PALLAVAS**

identified with this Maṇavāḷapperumāḷ who, later under the name Kōpperuñjiṅga (I), seceded from the Chōḷa suzerainty and set up an independent principality with Śēndamaṅgalam as his seat of government *(Ep. Ind., Vol. XXIV, p. 22 ff).* Since Maṇavāḷapperumāḷ figures in the regin of Kulōttuṅga-Chōḷa III, the present inscription has to be attributed to the regin of this king. The title *Munaiyadaraiyan* applied in this record to this chieftain in addition to *Achalakulōttuṅgan* appears to have been assumed by him by virtue of his authority over the Malaiyamān country. In the *Epigraphical Report* for 1936-37 (Part II, paragraph 35), it has been stated, on the strength of an epigraph from Villiyanūr in French India that there should have been two chiefs bearing the name Peruñjiṅga. Since Maṇavāḷapperumāḷ figures as early as the 17th years of Kulōttuṅga-Chōḷa III (i.e., A. D. 1195─No. 313 of 1902), the interval between this date and A. D. 1279 corresponding to the 36th year of a Kōpperuñjiṅga of accession A. D. 1243, i.e. 85 years, is ordinarily impossible for the active rule of a single chief. This, therefore, furnishes an additional argument for postulating the existence of two chief of the name Peruñjiṅga. To Peruñjiṅga II has probably to be assigned No. 379 from Aṅganūr. This inscription refers to *Śēnai* **Narasioṅgapanman,** a *Sāmanta-Mudali* of this chief, who constructed a tank for the merit of his grandmother Mōgiyar.

**[*Rājanārāvaṇa-Kāḍavarāya.*](cnt2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 27. A much later member of this Pallava family comes to notice in an in- scription from Elavānāśūr (No. 508), which from its palæography may be assigned to about the 14th century A.D. It mentions that Pānnaraṅganār, a wife of Pallavan *alias* **Rājanārā\[ya\*\]ṇa-Kāḍa- Varāya** dug the channel called the Puttūrkāl. As the donatrix referred to as a *Nambirāṭṭi* of Pallavan it is possible that the latter was a local chieftain of some status. His prenomen ‘Rājanārāyaṇa’ suggests that he was a subordinate of Rājanārāyaṇa-Śambuvarāya who was ruling over Tirukkōyilūr and the surrounding country in the second quarter probably of the 14th century A. D.
