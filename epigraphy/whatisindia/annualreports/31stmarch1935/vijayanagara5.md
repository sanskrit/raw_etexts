****VIJAYANAGARA****

A copper-plate record of Sadāśiva (C.P. No. 8), dated in Śaka 1486, Raktākshin, registers a *sarvamānya* grant made by the king at the instance of Aḷiya-Rāmarāja, of the village Siripura *alias* Raghunāthapura in Velnāḍu sthala of the Koṇḍavīḍu-Mahārājya to the scholar Chiṭṭi-Bhaṭṭa, son of Gaṇapayārya and grandson of Tuṇḍipalle Siṅgārya of the Kauśika gōtra. The preamble containing the genealogy of the king in the present record is identical in phrasaeology with that in the Bēvinahaḷḷi grant of the king dated in Śaka 1473 (*Ep. Ind., Vol.* XIV, pp. 216 ff). A few additional verses are, however, added in the present inscription while giving the genealogy of Aḷiya Rāmarāja. The donated village Siripura may be identified with the village of the same name in the Sattenapalle taluk of the Guntur distrcit.

**[*Vipravinodins.*](contents4.html#_ftnref1100)**  
In the Ep. Rep. for 1932-33, page 77, mention is made the Vipravinōdi community in the Cuddapah district, which figures largely in the period of Sadāśiva’s reign. It is also mentioned in a record copied this year from Iñjēḍu in the Kurnool district (No. 271) dated in Śaka 1475, Ānanda, when some members of the community made a gift to the God Veṅkaṭanātha of Iñjēḍu on the day of Śrīrāma-Jayanti for the merit of their community.

**[*Śrīraṅgadēva-Maharaya.*](contents4.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 71. In an inscription of Śrīraṅgadēva-Mahārāya form the Tirukkoyilur taluk, (No. 55), which is dated in the cyclic year Bahudhānya and Śaka 1450 (wrong), a village named Akkappanāyaka pāḷaiyam in Vīrapāṇḍyanallūr śīrmai is stated to have been granted as *sarvamānya* by Tirumalai-Nambi Tiruvēṅkaṭayyan to the religious teacher Tiruvaraṅgam Tātāchārya, as a gift of Vaiyyappa-Nāyaka Kṛishṇapa-Nāyaka. We know from No. 60 that Akkappa-Nāyaka was the father of Koṇḍama-Nāyaka to whom Vīrapāṇḍyanallūr had been granted by Kṛishṇama-Nāyaka, son of Vaiyyappa. The gift-village mentioned in the present record must have received its name from Akkappa. The Śaka date seems to be a mistake for Śaka 1500 which falls in the reign of Śrīraṅga. The same donor figures again in Śaka 1519 corresponding to Hēviḷambi, when he made

**[*Gift for a *Rāmānujakūṭam**](contents4.html#_ftnref1100)**  
(feeding house). an endowment of land for conducting a *Rāmānujakūṭam* to the same teacher for the merit of the (Śeñji) chief Vaiyyppa-Nāyaka Kṛishṇappa-Nāyaka (No. 71). In a record from the Tirukkoyilur taluk (No. 69), this Kṛishṇappa-Nāyaka is stated to have presented the village of Koḍanūr to the temple of Paṭṭābhirāma at Śeñji. One of his agents was Bommayya-Piḷḷai, who presented as the gift of his master, the village Śirrāmūr in the same taluk for the sacred bath and offerings to the god Chidambarēśa, evidently the deity at Chidambaram (No. 68). The identity of Vaiyyappa has been discussed in some detail in the *Epigraphical Report* for 1933-34, Part II, paragraph 34.

**[*Veṅkaṭapatidēva-Mahāraya (I).*](contents4.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 72. A set of copper-plates of Veṅkatapatidēva-Mahārāya (No. 13) dated in Śaka 1533, Virōdhikṛit, which is reported to have been found at Śrīperumbūdūr in the Chingleput district registers a *sarvamānya* grant made by the king in the presence of the god Veṅkaṭēśa, of the village Chittūru renamed Raghupatisamudram including its hamlet Mūvēndrappattu, to a scholar versed in the *Vedānta,* the *Tarka* and the eighteen *Purānas,* named Ammāḷāchārya, son of Kṛishṇayāchārya and grandson of Vaṅgipura-Ammāḷayya of the Bhāradvāja-gōtra, Āpastamba-sūtra and Yajus-śākha. The village is stated to have been situated in Ūttukkāḍi sīma, a subdivision of Cheṅgāḍu-kōtta of Paḍaivī¬ḍu-mahārājya Another record (No. 311) which is from Indukūru in the Cuddapah district mentions Chinabhaṇḍāram Nāgappa-Nāyaniṅgāru who was the Treasury Officer of the king, whose agent *(mudrakartā)* a certain Timmannagāru made some grant to the *Kāpus* of the village.

**[*Veṅkaṭapatidēva II.*](contents4.html#_ftnref1100)**  
73. Along with the plates of Veṅkata mentioned above was received, strung on to the same ring, an odd copper-plate of Veṅkatapatidēva II dated in Saka
