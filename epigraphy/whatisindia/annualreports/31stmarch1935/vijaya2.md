**THE VIJAYANAGARA KINGS**

It may be pointed out that the title Śambuvarāya-sthāpanāchārya is also borne by Mahāmaṇḍalēśvara **Sāvaṇadēva-Mahārāja** in two records from Villiyanūr (Nos. 195 and 196) dated in the cyclic year. Prabhava and Pramādi, corresponding respectively to Śaka 1309 and Śaka 1321 in which he is also given the title *Mēdini-mīsaragaṇḍa and Kaṭṭāri-Śāḷuva.* They register a remission of taxes granted by the king in favour of the temple of Tirukkāmīśvaram-uḍaiyaNāyanār at Villiyanallūr. He is probably identical with the prince referred to as the ‘ Kumāra’ of Bukka in inscriptions found at Tiruvaiyāru (Tanjore distrcit) dated in Śaka 1303 (No. 253 of 1894) and Puñjai-Pugalūr (Coimbatore districk No. 350 of 1928) in this period. Both these records from Villiyanallūr end with the name ‘Hariharanātha’ in Telugu characters which probably stands for the royal sign-manual.

**[*Harihara II.*](cont2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 53. From the same village come three records of **Ariyaṇa-Uḍaiyar** (Harihara II) dated in Śaka 1301 (Nos. 183 and 184) and Śaka 1303 (No. 194), of which Nos. 194 and 183 refer to the institution by the king of a festival in the temple of Tirukkāmīś-varam-uḍaiya-Nāyanār in the month of Paṅguni, when the god was taken out to the sea for bath. The expenses of this service were met by an endowment of 10 mā of land, made tax-free, and by the assignment in favour of the temple, of the vāl-vari, due to the king. In the *Ep. Rep.* for 1932-33, p. 71, it was remarked that the exact nature of the tax-vāla-vari was not known ; but from No. 194 it is clear that it must be taken as **Vāl-vari** and that it was a tax levied on animals, the rates in the time of Harihara II being ½ *paṇam on cows, ¾ paṇam,* on she-buffaloes and 1/8 *paṇam* on sheep. The other inscription of the king (No. 184) registers a gift of land for maintaining a perpectual lamp by Araiyan Malaippiḷḷai alias Tennāṭṭaraiyan, a merchant of Ulundai (i.e.,) the modern Uḷundūrpeṭ.

**[*Virupaksha II.*](cont2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 54. An incomplete record in Sanskrit prose (No. 54) from Śrīraṅgam belongs to the time of **Virūpāksha II** who is described as the son of Harihara II and Mallāmbikā and the *dauhitra* of Rāmadēva-Mahā- rāya of the Yādavakula. The Śoraikkāvūr plates and the Ālampūṇḍi grant of Virūpāksha are not consistent as to the relationship of Virūpāksha with Rāmadēva. This Rāmadēva cannot be identical with the Yādava king Rāmachandra who ruled between 1271 and 1309 A.D., because Harihara II (A.D.1377-1404) could not possibly have been his son-in-law, and Dr Hultzsch has thrown out a suggestion that perhaps the Yādava Rāmachandra had a son named Rāma-bhūpati. The present inscription does not help to solve this point, as it simple states that Virūpāksha was the dauhitra of Rāmadēva-Mahārāya, who is called ‘ Yādavakula-kamala-mārttaṇḍa.’ Virūpāksha is herein styled Rājā Virūpāksha, but special significance is perhaps not to the attached to the title Rājā (king), for no records of his as king are found in the Tamil districts. In this as well as in the other records noted above, he claims victories over the Chōḷa, Tuṇḍīra and Pāṇḍya territories and is stated to have invaded Ceylon also. In the course of his southern campaign it is possible that Virūpāksha paid a visit to Śrīraṅgam ; but from this incomplete record we cannot say what his donation to this temple was. It may perhaps have been the gilding of the temple claimed for him in the Soraikkāvūr plates. In the present epigraph the king is said to have visited the *guru* **Vidyāraṇya** whom he appears to have consulted as to the best means of acquiring merit. As Vidyāraṇya died in A.D. 1386 *(Mys. Archl. Report,* 1916, p. 56) this visit must have occurred before this date. The high position which Vidyāraṇya held in the Vijayanagara court is known from several record. He was also the special *guru* of Harihara II himself *(Mys. Archl. Report,* 1933. p. 23).

**[*Bukka II, Saka 1328,*](cont2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 55. A record from Vaṇṭyāla, a hamlet of Perḍūtu in the South Kanara distrcit, belongs to Bukka, son of Harihara II, and is dated in Śaka 1328, Vyaya, (=A.D. 1406, August). The king is stated to have been ruling from Vijayanagara, while his governor at Bārakūru was Bāchappa of Goa. This Bāchappa of Bāchaṇṇa-Oḍeya was a governor of Maṅgalūru and Bārakūru rājyas for three years under Dēvaraya I (No. 609 of 1929-30). The present inscription records a gift of the village Bramhāra in Bārakūru-nāḍu and certain incomes from other villages includng Kanyāna, Pentama and Beḷamji to **Purāṇika Kavi Kṛishṇa-Bhaṭṭa** of Śṛiṅgēri, for the renovation and maintenance of a **library** *(pustakabhaṇḍāra)* belonging to the Śṛiṅgēri-maṭha, when **Narasimha-Bhārati-Voḍeya of Śriṅgēri** who probably succeeded Vidyāraṇya-tīrtha, was its pontiff. This *guru* is also
