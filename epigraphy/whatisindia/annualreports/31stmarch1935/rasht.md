**THE RASHTRAKUTAS**

**[*Indra III, his date.*](cnt2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
19. Among the kings of this dynasty, only two, Indra III and Kṛishṇa III figure in the stone records of the collection. No 235 from Kamalāpuram in the Cuddapah district belongs to Indra III. It states that when king **Nityavarsha Indra-Narēndra** was ruling the Mahāraṭṭa-rājya and a chieftain named Pallava- dhīra was governing the Muḷki-500, a certain Mahāsāmanta whose name is lost but who had the titles of ‘Vikrānta-Rāma’, ‘Vikrānta-Bhīma’, etc., constructed (or repaired) the doorway and *maṇḍapa* in the temple of god Mulkeṁṭīśvara (Mukkaṇṭīśvara) and provided subsidiary shrines for the eight *parivāradēvatās* therein. The record is dated in **Śaka 848,** Pārthiva, which corresponded to A. D. 925-26, and is important as it extends the period of rule of king Indra III till this year. In his publication The *Rāshṭrakūṭas* *And Their Times* (p. 105) Dr. Altekar has assumed that Indra had died in 917 A. D. and was succeeded by his son Amōghavarsha II ; but against this have to be noted No. 47 of 1904 from the Bellary district which is dated in Śaka 842, Vikrama (=A.D. 920), and No. 272 of 1918 (S. I. I., Vol. IX, No. 57) which is dated in Śaka 844 (A. D. 922, September 9) of the reign of Nityavarsha Indra-Ballaha, and the present record which would further take Indra III’s regin till at least the end of A. D. 925. As a record of Gōvinda IV is also found dated in A. D. 918-19 *(Ind. Ant.,* Vol. XII, p. 223), we have to presume that he was a co-regent along with his father for some years. In this connection it may be suggested that a record of Nityavarsha dated in the same year, Śaka 847 and Pārthiva, which has been attributed to Gōvinda IV may probably belong to Indra III himself (B. K. Inss. Volume I, Part I, No. 34). The name of god **Mulkeṁṭīśvara** referred to in this record appears to have the particular significance of having been consecrated by the quasi-historical Mukkaṇti-Kāḍuveṭṭi (Trilōchana), rather than being a simple name of the three-eyed god Śiva. At Kalavaguṇṭa in the Chittoor district is a temple of god Mukkaṇṭīśvara whose foundation is, however, wrongly attributed (Sewell’s List, Vol. I, p. 155) in popular tradition to a Chōḷa king. At Ēlēśvaram in the Nizam’s Dominions, opposite to the famous Nāgārjunakoṇḍa ruins, is reported to exist a temple of god Mukkaṇṭīśvara. A Noḷamba-Pallava chief named Tribhuvanadhīra is mentioned in a record of the 26th year of Kṛishṇa III from Vellore in the North Arcot district (Ep. Ind., Vol. IV, p. 82) ; but it is not clear whether he can be connected with the chieftain Pallavadhīra referred to above.

**[*Kṛishṇa III and his Vaidumba feudatories.*](cnt2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 Three records of **Kannaradēva** (Nos. 437, 441 and 442) in the year’s collection come from the Tirukkoyilur taluk of the South Arcot district. Of these No. 441 from Jambai dated in his 18th year mentions a chieftain named **Tiruvaiyan** who was wielding authority in that locality *(innāḍu ālginra).* The family to which he belonged is not specified ; but he may be identified with the Vaidumba chieftain of the same name, who figures in records dated in the 22nd and 24th years of Kṛishṇa III in this locality (Nos. 235 and 268 of 1902 and Ep. Ind., Vol. VII, p. 143). As another Vaidumba chief named Tiruvaiyan Śrikaṇṭha figures in a record of the 25th year of Kṛishṇa III (No. 743 of 1905), we may assume that this Tiruvaiyan who was perhaps the father of Śrīkaṇṭha must have died by A.D. 962. A record of Kannara from Kīlūr (No. 16 of 1905) whose date is unfortunately lost, mentions a Vikramāditya Vaidumba-Mahārāja who was ruling over Malāḍu, Vāṇagappāḍi-nāḍu, Śiṅgapura-nāḍu and Veṇkunra-kōṭṭam as a Rāsḥṭrakūṭa vassal, and as such, he must have been a predecessor of this chief Tiruvaiyan and lived prior to the 18th year of Kṛishṇa III. In the present inscription the chief Tiruvaiyan is said to have granted 15 kalañju of gold with which the Śaṅkarappāḍiyār community of Vāḷaiyur
