**THE VIJAYANAGARA KINGS**

Raghunātharājayadēva-Mahārāja in Śaka 1484 (No.265).  
14. Sūrappa-Nāyaka, son of Pottappi-Nāyaka of the Kāśyapa-gōtra, wield- ing authority at Ādanūr in Magadai-maṇḍalam in Śaka 1474 (No. 465).

 72. King **Veṅkaṭapati** is represented by six inscriptions. Of these No. l198 dated in Śaka 1514 which comes from Animala in the Kamalapuram taluk of the Cuddapah district mentions the gifts made by **Gaṅgādhararāja Dēvachōḍa- Mahārāja,** son of Guruvarāja-Basavarāja of the Kāśyapa-gōtra, evidently a Maṭla feudatory in charge of the territory. No. 271 from Sambaṭūru in the Cuddapah district refers to a certain Nārappa as the *Mudrakartā* of Raghunātharāya, who was himself under Mahāmaṇḍalēśvara **Jillēḷḷa Raṅgapatirājadēva-Mahārāja** in Śaka 1527, while No. 325 of Śaka 1522 registers the gifts of lands made by a certain Nārāyaṇayya, son of Purāṇam Bhūpaya for worship in certain temples at Prāntakōṭa (the modern Prātakōṭa) for the merit of Mahāmaṇḍalēśvara Rāmarāja Gōpālarājayyadēva-Mahārāja. Of the Tamil records of the king from the Tirukkoyilur taluk of the South Arcot district, No. 506, dated in Śaka 1517 refers to Veṅkaṭapati I and the (Gingee) chief Koṇḍappa-Nāyaka, for whose merit some lands called Malaiyārēndal appear to have been endowed by Veṅka\[ṭama-Nāyaka\], to a Vishṇu shrine at Elavānāśūr. In No. 426 from Tiruppālaippandal which is dated in Śaka 14\[7\]6, Ānanda, and purports to belong to the reign *(pṛithvi-rājyam)* of Mahāmaṇḍalēśvara **Veṅkaṭapatirāya,** the date quoted would appear to be wrong if Veṅkatapati were not identical with Veṅkaṭādri, the brother of Aḷiya Rāmarāya, who was in charge of the country round Tiruvaiyāru in Śaka 1480 (A. S. R.1911-12, p.179). The inscription under notice mentions a chief by name Kulaśēkhara-Vāṇādarāya for whose merit a gift of land was made.

**[*Śrīraṅgarāya.*](cnt3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 73. Two copper-plate grants (Nos. 13 and 14) received from Nandyal in the Kurnool district, are both of them dated in Śaka 1569, Sarvajit, in the reign of **Śrīraṇgarāya, Mahārāya.** They purport to have been issued by the *Nāḍigas, Reḍḍis, Karaṇas* and merchants of Nandyāla to one Timmaya, son of Saruvaya of the Dāsari community, authorising him to collect some specified. contributions from several communities and villages in that locality, for the expenses of the *Chapparam* festival in the temple of god Veṅkaṭēśvara apparently at Nandyal itself, which had been discontinued for some years previously owing to *avāntaram* (troublous times). The grants bear at the beginning the word, ‘Śrī-Veṅkaṭēśvara’, which appears to be an invocation to the god of that name, and does not stand for the sign-manual of the later Vijayanagara kings. As such, these two documents may have been in the nature of private arrangements between the specified parties, which apparently did not require or obtain the cognizance of the authorities. A local Muslim chieftain or officer by name Hajarati Khān Khān Sāheb is mentioned in both these records for whose merit the gift is said to have been made. A fragmentary stone record of the same king which comes from Tiruchchendurai (No.148) is dated in Śaka 1581, Vikāri and registers some provision made for the sacred bath of the god at that village.
