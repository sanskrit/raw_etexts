**THE CHOLAS**

Vallāḷadēvan proceeded to (?) Śaṇbai’. As the inscription stops with the mention of Śaṇbai we are puzzled as to the result of the fight. But the death of Vallāḷadēva at the hands of Gaṇḍagōpāla is an important piece of information. The date of the record precludes the possibility of its reference to Ballāḷa II or III. As the dynasty itself came to be called ‘Ballāḷa’ after the glorious reign of Ballāḷa II, we can only take Vallāḷadēva of the present inscription to refer to a Hoysaḷa king, who, at his time, could be no other than Narasiṁha II. Thus we may take A. D. 1238-39 as the date of this king. It is the fall of his father at the hands of Tikka that should have been the immediate cause of Sōmēśvara’s expedition against that chief.

**[*Rājēndra-Chōḷa III.*](cnt2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 43. Of Rajendra-Chōḷa III there are only 3 inscriptions in the collection dated in the 3rd , 4th and 6th year of his regin (Nos. 29, 27 and 73). In the first of these he is merely called Tribhuvanachakravartin, the second begins with an introduction of which portions are lost and gives the king the surname Parakēsarivarman. No 73 dated in his **6th year** calls him Tribhuvanachakravartin **Rājēndra-Chōḷadēva** ‘who revived the Manu dynasty and wore the legitimate (or righteous) crown’. It records an endow- ment of land after purchase made for worship and other requirements in the temple of Śrīdēvīśvaramuḍaiyār at Tiruveḷḷarai by **Śiṅgaṇṇa-Daṇḍanāyaka** who had consecrated the image of the god therein. This Śiṅgaṇṇa is perhaps the same as the general of Sōmēśvara who is stated in an inscription at Vēdāraṇyam in the Tanjore district (No. 501) of 1904) to have made an inroad into the Chōḷa territory in A. D. 1241, as a consequence of which worship was stopped in the temple of Kōḍikkulagar but was revived some time later. Now the construction of a temple by the same chief in the Chōḷa territory and provision for worship therein suggests that Rājēndra-Chōḷa’s overlordship was acknowledged by Sōmēśvara and that the former had sufficiently consolidated his position and recovered the prestige lost during the time of his predecessor. This is also indicated by the titles *Manukulameḍutta* and *Nerimuḍi-śūḍiya* assumed by him, as stated above.
