**THE VIJAYANAGAR KINGS**

Vaḷavanallūr in Paḍaivīḍu-śāvaḍi to *Rāyarśavāttu* Aṇṇappa-Nāyaka, son of Bukka-Nāyaka of Dēvagiri must be assigned to Dēvarāya II as it is attested by Uttama-Nambi and Chakraraya.

**[*Mallikarjuna : his governors.*](cn2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
46. Mallikarjuna is represented by a C. P. record (C. P. No. 16) dated in Śaka 1383, Vṛisha, wherein he is called Immaḍi Prauḍhadēva and is said to be the son of Dēvarāya II by Ponnalādēvī. It records the gift of an *agrahāra* by the king called Mallikārjunarāyapuram after his name in Kaḷat- tūr-kōṭṭam among several Brahmans, in the presence of the god Virūpāksha at Hampi. No. 33, dated in Śaka 1369, also refers itself to the god Virūpāksha dēvarāya-Mahārāya. This is in Grantha characters and in Kannaḍa language and gives details of provision made for the requirements of offerings to the deity in the Śrīraṅgam temple endowed in the names of donor (name lost) and of Mādaṇṇa-Daṇṇāyaka, Śirupparasa, Hiriya-Śirupparasa, Nāgāyamma and Ammakkamma. **Mādaṇṇa** of this record figures as the **Governor of Muḷuvāy** under Dēvarāya II in Śaka 1362 (No. 196 of 1910), and **Sirupparasar** is mentioned in an inscription of Śaka 1353 (No. 497 of 1926) as the **Governor of Paḍaivīḍu** under the same king. Another record from the same place (No. 106), dated in Śaka 1370, Vibhava, which may be assigned to this king, mentions as donor a certain officer by name *Karaṇikka* Ponnambalanātha, son of *Karaṇikka* Bhārati Viṭṭaṇṇa of the Śrīvatsa-*gōtra.* This also, like the above is in Grantha characters and Kannaḍa language, thus indicating the mother-tongue of the donor. Still another inscription of the king, dated in Śaka 1378 (No. 92), while describing the boundaries of a gift-land makes mention of ‘ Nānmuga-gōpuram’, ‘Akaḷaṅkan-tirumadil’ and ‘ Tirumaṅgai Alvār-tirumadil’ all of which retain the same names even now.

**[*Sāḷuva Narasiṁha.*](cn2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 47. A record from Śrīraṅgam (No. 22), dated in Śaka 1405, does not mention any ruling king, though an epigraph of Virūpaksha, dated 3 years later, is found at Anbil a few miles from this place (No. 593 of 1902). The present record gives the name of the donor as **Mahāmaṇḍaḷēśvara Timmaya,** son of Sāḷuva Kamparaśar Mallayar with a few *birudas* added to his name. This chief figures in an inscription at Tirupati in Śaka 1403 (No. 57 of 1889). It is evidently on the representation of this Timmarāja (called Periya Timmarāja in the inscrip- tion) that an additional endowment of a village (recorded in No. 239 from Kāṅganūr in the North Arcot district) was made by Sāḷuva Narasiṅgadēva-Mahārāya in Śaka 1413 for the worship of the deity during festivals while halting in the Sāḷuvarāyan-maṇḍapa at Tiruvaṇṇāmalai.

**[*Immaḍi-Narasiṁha.*](cn2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 48. Saḷuva Narasiṅga’s son Immaḍi-Narasiṁha is called **Immaḍi Timmaya- dēva-Mahārāya** in two inscriptions (Nos. 240 and 243), dated in Śaka 1415 and 1416, and **Chikka Narasā-Nāyaka,** son of Narasā-Nāyaka in No. 54, dated in the cyclic year Naḷa corresponding to Śaka 1418. No, 243 records the remission of some taxes on a village by a certain Tirumalai-Nāyaka on behalf of Narasā-Nāyaka. The other inscription (No. 240) which like No. 243 refers to the king as the son of Bhujabalarāya Sāḷuva Narasiṅgarāya, records the gift of the village Śirupākkam surnamed Timmarāyapuram after the king, to the god at Tiruvaṇṇāmalai. No.144. from Śrīraṅgam, dated Śaka 1421, evidently is the reign of Immaḍi-Narasiṁha, mentions as donor **Vīramarasa, son of Sōmarasar of Mūḷvāy.** He is called ‘ the Lord of the Southern Ocean’ in an inscription form the same district (No. 664 of 1909) dated in Śaka 1422 in the reign of Bhujabala Immaḍi-Tammayadēva (i.e., Immaḍi-Narasiṁha).

 Another inscription from the same place (No. 5) which does not refer itself to the reign of any king, is dated in Śaka 1419, which falls into the period of Immaḍi-Narasiṁha. It mentions an endowment made by Narasamman, the wife of **Kommarāja Periya Timmarāja-Uḍaiyar** who is identical with the chief of the same name referred to in an inscription from Viriñchipuram in the North Arcot district (S. I. I., Vol. I, No. 115). This Narasamman also figures in an inscription dated in Śaka 1415 from Conjeevaram (No. 638 of 1919).

**[*Vīra-Narasiṁha.*](cn2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 49. Vira-Narasiṁha, son of Tuḷuva Narasā-Nāyaka, is called Vīrapratāparāya Vasantarāya Bhujabalarāya Vīra Narasiṅgadēva-Mahārāya in No. 155 form Śrīraṅgam, dated in Śaka 1428, Prabhava. The titles *Vasantarāya and Bhujabala* have been applied to this king in another inscription of his (No. 408 of 1913). The latter was a well known title assumed by Sāḷuva-Narasiṁha.
