**THE KAKATIYAS**

**[*Ganapati, his feudatory Sarngadhara.*](cont.html#_ftnref1100)**  
16. The Kākatīya dynasty is represented in the current year’s collection by 8 inscriptions from the Guntur distrcit, of which six (Nos. 337, 305, 295, 293, 301 and 294) ranging in date from Śaka 1149 to Śaka 1174 belong to Gaṇapatidēva, and one (No. 307) dated in Śaka 1193 to his successor Rudradēva-Mahārāja (Rudrāmbā).

Śārṅgadhara had the surname Chakranārāyaṇa. The text of this inscription has been published in Butterworth and Venugopal Chetty’s *Nellore Inscriptions,* Vol. I, p. 144 ff.\* Among the stone inscriptions, No. 295 registers a gift of 3 *Kēsari-gadya* coins out of the *rācha-suṅka* (royal toll) income due from Bhaṭṭiprōlu made in Śaka 1160 by *Suṅkādhikāri* Maṇḍaya, son of Malle-Peggaḍa, to the temple of Bhōgīśvara of the place. The coin *Kēsarigadya* which was current in the locality during the Kākatīya period appears to have had an emblem of the *kēsari* (lion) on it, after which it must have received its name. It may be noted that the donor is styled the *Suṅkādhikāri* of
