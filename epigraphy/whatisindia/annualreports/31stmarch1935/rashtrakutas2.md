****RASHTRAKUTAS****

interesting information that a stone set up in the time of **Vaidumba- Maharaja** recording a gift of land yielding 80 khaṇḍugas (of paddy) made to the temple of Samarthēśvara by Akālavarsha Chalake Nallāta Kannaradēva, having been broken away, Mahāmaṇḍalēśvara Bhima-Mahārāja of the Vaidumba family, son of Ma\[du\[ka-Mahārāja renovated the temple and renewed the gift by granting 200 *matter* of land on the old terms of tenure in Śaka 978, Durmati (wrong for Durmukhi), corresponding to A.D. 1056, and had the gift now engraved on stone. The chief Bhima-Mahārāja is stated to have belonged to the *lunar race* **(Somakula-tilaka).** Akālavarsha Kannaradēva of the present record who bore the biruda of Chalake-Nallāta was evidently Kṛishṇa III (A.D. 939-967) whose Karhāḍ grant in A.D. 959 refer to his parcelling out of his southern territory from his camp at Mēlpāḍi, among his subordinates who had probably helped him in subjugating the Chōḷas in the South (Ep., Ind., Vol. IV, pp. 278 ff.). It is possible that Kṛishṇa III might have granted land to the temple of Samarthēśvara on the eve of his expedition to the Toṇḍaimaṇḍalam i.e. about A.D. 948 after subduing the Vaidumbas on the way, or about A.D. 959, when he repaired to the South to establish his rule in the Tamil country. The Vaidumba relationship with the Rāshṭrakūtas prior to the time of Kṛishṇa III is not disclosed by inscriptions, which only represent them as the enemies of the Noḷambas and Gaṅgas. For an account of some earlier Vaidumba chiefs, attention may be drawn to *Ep. Rep.* for 1923, pp. 99-101.

It is noteworthy that the present inscription does not refer to any suzera in power. This is perhaps due to the unsettled political conditions of the time of the record, i. e., Śaka 978, when the Chōḷas and the Chāḷukyas, the two paramount powers of the south were engaged in constant warfare. We know that on the decline of the Rāshtrakūtas, the Vaidumbas had been conquered by the Chōḷa king Parāntaka I (S.I.I.,Vol. II, p. 3. 9) and were the feudatories of Rājarāja I and Rājēndra-Chōḷa I(S.I.I., Vol. III, pp. 104 and 107) in Toṇḍai- maṇḍalam. The chiefs Maduka-Mahārāja and his son Bhīma-Mahārāja are not known hitherto from any other source.
