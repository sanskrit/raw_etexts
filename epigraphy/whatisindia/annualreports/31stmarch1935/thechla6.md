**THE CHOLAS**

**[*Rajaraja III.*](cnt2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 2. Of Rājarāja III there are about are about 20 inscriptions in the collection ranging in date from the 6th to the 28th year of his reign. Two of these (Nos. 31 and 32) begin with the introduction *Śīrmanni,* etc. A fragmentary inscription from Tinnanūr (No. 171) dated in the 6th year of the king refers to the destruction of Ninravūr caused by *śūḷai* (pillage) in the previous year and to the gallant part played in its defence by a certain hero. No. 185 from Kunrap- pākkam in the Chittoor district dated in the 18th year of Tribhu- vanachakravartin Rājarājadēva records the gift of that village, to god Tiru- vēṅgaḍam-Uḍaiyān by Śenni Tirukkāḷattidēvan alias Yādavarāyan. A number of inscriptions have been copied in previous years in the Chittoor, North Arcot and Chingleput districts, mostly of the time of Rājarāja III while a few belong to his predecessor Kulōttuṅga III, which record endowments made by Tirukkāḷattidēva *alias* Yādavarāya (No. 16 of 1897, No. 87 of 1922), Vīra-Narasiṁhadēva *alias* Yādavarāya (Nos. 200 of 1892, 633 of 1904, 640 of 1904, 199 of 1912, 406 of 1896, 227 of 1912), Narasiṁha Tirukkāḷattidēva *alias* Yādavarāya (No. 94 of 1903), Śaśikulachaḷukki Vīranārasiṅgadēva (No. 172 of 1903), Śaśikulachaḷukki Tirukkāḷattidēva alias Yādavarāya (Nos. 181 and 191 of 1903), Śaśikulachaḷukki Vīranārasiṅgadēva *alias* Yādavarāya (No. 182 of 1903), and Śaśikulachaḷukki Tanininruvenra Vīranārasiṅgadēva *alias* Yādavarāya (Nos. 183 and 200 of 1903).

**[*His Yadavaraya subordinates.*](cnt2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 In the *Tirupati Dēvasthānam Inscriptions* (Vol. I, pp. 103-104), Tirukkāḷattidēva and Vīranārasiṁha are treated as chiefs one following the other in close successsion. As Narasiṁha Tirukkāḷattidēva figures in two inscriptions, dated in the 7th year of Kulōttuṅga-Chōḷa III (No. 94 of 1903) and the 15th year of Rājarāja III (No. 172 of 1903), *i. e.,* in A. D. 1185 and 1231 covering a period of 45 years, and in the interval a chief by name Vīra-Narasiṁha figures about A. D. 1212 in the reign of Kulōttuṅga-Chōḷa III (NO. 93 of 1903) we have to suppose the existence of more than one chief of the name Tirukkāḷattidēva. The present record furnishes one more surname, viz., Śenni for the latter chief.

 Another inscription of Rājarāja which deserves notice is No. 14 from Jambu- kēśvaram. It records a receipt given by two brothers for the money due to them from the temple for the purchase of some dry and wet lands belonging to them. The amount was not paid to them directly but by means of an *ediriḍai* (counter agreement) got by Dakshiṇāmurti-Aṇḍār on behalf of the temple from Kāḷagam-Nāyakar who seems to have been an agent of Bhōgaya-Dhaṇḍanāyaka. This Daṇḍanāyaka is known to us already as one of the two generals Bhōgaya and Mallaya who were sent by the Hoysaḷa king Narasiṁha II in his campaign against the Pāṇḍya, and who in A. D. 1237 granted the eleven villages, conferred on them by prince Sōmēśvara evidently for their valour, to Brahmans in the presence of god Rāmanātha at Sētu (A. S. R. for 1909-10, p. 153).

**[*Vallāḷadēva killed by Gaṇḍagōpāla..*](cnt2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 The help rendered by Hoysaḷa Narasiṁha II to Rājarāja III early in his reign against the Pāṇḍyas, and later on in freeing the Chōḷa king from imprisonment at the hands of Peruñjiṅga which gave him the claim to the title of the ‘Establisher of the Chōḷa kingdom is well known. A similar claimant to that title was the Telugu-Chōḍa chief Tikka *alias* Gaṇḍagōpāla of Nellore who was also a friend and ally of Rājarāja. Narasiṁha’s subsequent power and influence in the Chōḷa territory is evidenced by the presence of several Hoysaḷa generals at Tirumalavāḍi and Conjeeveram. One of his inscriptions (E. C. XII, Tp. 42) refers to him as ruling from Kāñchīpuram in A. D. 1230 and another (E. C., V, Cn. 211 b) to his army stationed at that place. The latest inscription found for him is the one at Tirumalavāḍi dated in A. D. 1235 (No. 39 of 1920). His interests thus brought him into conflict withs Gaṇḍagōpāla who, among his other achievements, ‘took Kāñchī and was ruling there after making it his own’ in A. D. 1231 (No. 446 of 1919 and A. R. for 1920, part II, para. 55). The clashes between the Hoysaḷa and this chief became rather frequent thereafter, and we find Narasiṁha’s son Sōmēśvara leading an expedition in August, A. D. 1240 against Tikka (E. C., VI, Kd. 100).The event leading to this engagement seems to receive light from an inscription of the current collection (No. 439) from Jambai in the South Arcot district, which is unfortunately very fragmentary. It is dated in the 23rd year of Rājarāja (A. D. 1239), and states that in the month of Chittirai of that year ‘Nayanār Gaṇḍagōpālar was pleased to go out (for fight ?) and having stabbed
