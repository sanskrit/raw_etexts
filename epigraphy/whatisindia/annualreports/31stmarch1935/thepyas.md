**THE PANDYAS**

 44. The Pāṇḍya inscriptions of the year come from the portion of the ancient Chōḷa territory corresponding to the present Trichinopoly district and the region to the north of it.

**[*Maravarman Sundara-Pāṇḍya I.*](cnt2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 The earliest is a verse inscription from Jambukēśvaram (No. 47) attributable to **Māravarman Sundara-Pāṇḍya I.** Above this record are crudely engraved the Pāṇḍya emblems of a pair of fish and an elephant-goad. This inscription states that in the 3rd year of his regin, the king Marān celebrated the anoint- ment of heroes at Āyirattaḷi and had this inscription engraved. The event is alluded to in the historical introduction of the king beginning with the words *Pūmaruviya,* etc., wherein it is stated that Sundara-Pāṇḍya burnt Tañjai and Urandai, drove the Śembiyan (i.e., the Chōḷa) to the forest, bestowed on a Bāṇa the latter’s golden crown set with gems and that thereafter he performed the anointment of heroes in the anointing hall of the unfriendly Vaḷavan at Āyirattaḷi. That the Chōḷa country was conquered and given back to Kulōttuṅga III is specifically mentioned in two records of the Pāṇḍya king (Nos. 72 of 1924 and 9 of 1926). Sundara-Pāṇḍya assumed the title *Śōnāḍu-koṇḍaruḷiya* from his 3rd year (No. 358 of 1916 and No. 549 of 1926) and the conquest must have been celebrated by the anointment at Āyirattaḷi in this year, as indicated by the inscription noticed above. The restitution of his kingdom to the Chōḷa king appears to have been made in the same year (No. 322 of 1927-28).

 There are three other records of this king (Nos. 3, 21 and 30) which were also secured from Jambukēśvaram. Of these, No. 3 which is dated in the 4th year and 154th day, was issued while the king was at Madura and gives an inventory of the jewels and other valuable articles belonging to the god TiruvānaikkāUḍaiyār. Among the varieties of silk then in use in this temple are mentioned *Puliyukirpūmpaṭṭu, Śēndilāṇippaṭṭu* and *Āriyan-Dēvāṅgu.* Another inscription (No. 21) refers to the provision made for conducting the Sundara-Pāndyan-śandi instituted in the temple in the name of the king, on the day of his natal asterism Aviṭṭam in the month of Āvaṇi. No significance is perhaps to be attached to the
