**[*Kaṇṇanūr occupied by the Muhammadans.*](contents4.html#_ftnref1100)**  
85. A record from Kaṇṇanūr in the Musiri taluk of the Trichinopoly district (No. 144), dated in the cyclic year Rākshasa, refers to the Muhammadan occupation of the country. No king is mentioned in the record, but from palaeography it may be may assigned to the 15th century A.D. This inscription states that the image of the god Alagapperumāḷ at Periya-Kaṇṇanūr in Mēlai-Vaḷḷuvappāḍi-nāḍu, which was kept hidden during the Muhammadan times, was reconsecrated in the temple and a land formerly in its enjoyment as *tiruvidaiyāṭṭam* was restored to it by a certain Vīraṇan, brother of Śrīgirinātha.

**[*Maraijñānasambandar, the author of Oṅgukoyilpuraṇam.*](contents4.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 86. A record from Tiruppattūr (No.6 180) dated in Śaka 1406, Krōdhin, corresponding to A.D. 1484, mentions Tiruvambalamuḍaiyār *alias* Maraijñānasambandar of the lineage of **Meykaṇḍa-Santāna,** residing at *Śirumadam* in the village, who composed a *purāṇam* called the **Oṅgukōyil-puraṇam,** evidently in honour of the deity named ‘ Ōṅgukōyiluraivār’ which was consecrated in the temple of Tiruttaḷiyāṇḍa-Nāyanār by Ponnan Uyyavandān alias Mānābharaṇa-Mūvēndavēḷār of Kappalūr about the 15th year of Sundara-Pāṇḍyadēva (No. 186). The present inscription states that the temple authorities at Tiruppattūr rewarded Maraijñānasambandar, for his literary composition by a grant of *5 mā* of land in Maṇṇimaṅgalam *alias Mēr-* Tirumaṅgalam belonging to the temple. The date in Meykaṇḍār noticed above has been fixed to be about A.D. 1232 *(Sen-Tamil,* Vol. III, pp. 89-90). There were more than one person by name Maraijñānasambandar, and the one mentioned in the present record is to be distinguished from the person of the same name who was the author of *Kamalālaya-purānam, Aruṇagiri-purāṇam* etc. and who lived about 1545 A.D.

**[*Abdul Wahab of Kurnool.*](contents4.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 87. A record from Vīpanagaṇḍla in the Kurnool district (No. 281), dated in Ś. 1632 (wrong for 1623), Vṛisha, registers the grant of some land by purchase in Vimapanagaṇḍla for the maintenance of a well. It incidentally states that this village had been granted to Mūsā-Khān by Abdulla Wahāb Sāhebu, who was ruling Kandanavrōlu sthala during the time of Sultan Pādaśāha of Vijayapura (Bijapur). This Abdullā Wahāb is identical with the Abyssinian general of the Bijapur Sultan, who took the fort of Kurnool from the local ruler Gōpalaraja and also governed this region till his death in A.D. 1618. His tomb at Kurnool on the bank of the Handri is architecturally noteworthy for the peculiar construction of its central dome.
