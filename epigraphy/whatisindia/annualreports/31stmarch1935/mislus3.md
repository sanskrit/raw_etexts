**MISCELLANEOUS**

protector of Kāñchīpura ’, etc. The former record is dated in Śaka 1047 and registers a provision made for maintaining a perpetual lamp in the temple of Sakalēśvara-Mahādēva by **Pinnama-Nāyuṇḍu,** son of Viṭṭapa-Nāyuḍu and grandson of Nāmi-Nāyuṇḍu, who was the lord of Māvundalapura. Other members of this family viz., Maṇḍe-Nāyaka, and his brothers Paṇḍe-Nāyaka and Sāde-Nāyaka are known to us from an inscription of this village copied in previous years (No. 289 of 1932-33), but their relationship to the chief of the present record is not known.

 The other record No. 346 dated in Śaka 1204, mentions **\[Erra\]-Nāyuṇḍu,** son of Dēvi-Nāyuṇḍu, and his elder brother Kommi-Nāyuṇḍu as the grandsons of Buddhavarman and registers the provision made for a perpetual lamp by the former and Pōnti-Nāyuḍu, son of the latter, to god Sagarēśvara-Mahādēva of Māvundala which is said to be their vṛitti in Koṇḍapaḍumaṭi country. The chiefs Maṇḍe-Nāyaka, Paṇḍe-Nāyaka and Sāde-Nāyaka referred to above also claim to have owned Māvundala as their *vṛitti.* Pōnti-Nāyuḍu of the present record seems to be identical with the Pōti-Nāyuḍu of the family who figures as a *sāmanta* of the Kākatīya queen Rudrāmbā in Śaka 1199 (Ep. Rep. for 1916, para. 52).

 No. 344, dated in Śaka 1077 introduces the Brahman minister **Karṇa,** his son Goṅka and the latter’s son Nāma by Kommamā. Nāma or Nāmana who makes a provision for a perpetual lamp to the god Sakalēśvara-Mahādeva of the village is described as ‘an ornament to the Yājñavālkya-kula ’ and is said to have belonged to the Kāśyapa-gotra.

**[*A spurious (?) Persian copper-plate grant.*](cnt3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 83. A set of three copper-plates inscribed in Persian characters (C. P. No. 21) was secured for examination from a resident of Hāvināḷ in the Indi taluk of the Bijapur district. It was kindly read for me by Mr. Yazdani, Government Epigraphist for Moslem inscriptions. It is dated in the 7th Rājab, 992 H. (=1584 A.D.) and purports to record the grant of some *inām* with all its rights and the office of *muquaddam* over the village Mauzai Oj in the Pargana of Bidrūr without the obligation of renewal of the *sanad* every year, on two brothers **Lakh-Gōvinda and Kanaka-Gōvinda** by king **Shah Ibrahim Bādshāh** (Ibrahim Qutb Shah) for rather queen reasons. A reports had been made to the royal court during a *Jamābandi* in which all officials high and low had gathered, that these two persons who were *muquaddams* of Muzai Oj under the *sarkār* had not paid the revenue *(tankawa)* amounting to 450 *huṇs* due from them up to date. They were produced before the king to whom they represented that they had no income wherewith to pay the sum. The king being convinced of the helplessness of the two persons. not only excused them from the payment of the revenue but also granted them the *ināms* as stated above. Qutb Shah ruled from 957-988 H., while the year given in the *sanad* is Shahur San 984 corresponding to 991-992 H., and as the subject matter is confused and the language is also defective, the Moslem Epigraphist is of the opinion that the *sanad* may not be a genuine document.

**[*Reference to marionette plays and theatre hall.*](cnt3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 84. References to marionette play and to dramatic art are found in three records of this year’s collection. One of these which is in Telugu and comes from the Cuddapah district (No. 216) is dated in Śaka 1501 and registers the endowment of the village Chadupurēla as *sarvamānya* by a certain Chandramayya to one Pedachiṭṭayya for the performance of screen-dramas *(teranāṭakam).* The donor who was probably a local chieftain appears to have been himself an art-connoiseur and composer and an adept in the art of marionette plays, as indicated by the *birudas* ‘Bommalāṭa-rayitu ’ and ‘Bommalāṭa-amṛitakavi’ borne by him. The other two records respectively dated in cyclic years corresponding to A.D. 1722 and 1723 (Nos. 49 and 48)are from Jambukēśvaram near Trichinopoly, and refer to the donor of a *maṇḍapa* as Pāṭakam Vaidyappayya, the son of Veṅkaṭēśvarayya, an instructor in the theatre-hall *(nāṭakaśāla-sikshakam)* of Vijayaraṅga Chōkkanātha-Nāyak. This theatre was probably attached to the royal palace situated at Trichinopoly. The Madura and Tanjore Nayaka rulers are known to have been great patrons of music and other fine arts, and the present inscriptions from Jambukēśvaram afford interesting epigraphical confirma- tion of the encouragements given by them to these arts.
