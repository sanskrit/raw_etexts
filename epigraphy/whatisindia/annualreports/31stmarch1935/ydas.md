**THE YADAVAS**

**[*Yadava Pratāpachakravarti Siṅghaṇadēva.*](cn2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
37. An undated Kannaḍa inscription from Pushpagiri (No. 410) belongs to the Yādava king Pratāpachakravarti Siṅghaṇadēva. It records an endow- ment made by his general Mahāpradhāna Nārāyaṇa Lakshmīdēva-Daṇḍanāyaka for the worship of the local deity and for the maintenance of a feeding house. This general is introduced with a number of *birudas* such as *Samasta-sēnādhipati, Bāhattara-niyōgōdhipati, Giridurgamalla* and *Paśchimarāya-Bhōjadēva-diśā- paṭṭa,* etc., Siṅghaṇa’s capture of the hill fort at Gutti is known to have taken place in A. D. 1239 (Ep. Car., Vol. VIII, Sorab 319) and his attempts to collect, revenue were resisted by force *(ibid.* Sorab 425 and 217). It is but natural, therefore, to find an inscription of his general in this region, which calls him the right arm (and) general *(dakshiṇabhuja-daṇḍanāyaka)* of the king.
