**THE VIJAYANAGARA KINGS**

singing the appropriate songs is assigned to a member of the Oduvār class belonging to the temple establishment. The donee in the present record was probably one such functionary.

**[*Bukka II.*](cnt3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 61. **Bukka II** is represented by 5 inscriptions. A gift of service-land is made in No. 417 of his reign, dated in Śaka 1326 to an *āvañjikkāran* who was newly appointed to do service in the temple of Tirunāgēṥvaram-Uḍaiyār at Tiruppālaippandal in the Tirukkoyilur taluk. An *āvañjikkāran* is ‘a drummer’, who has beat the drum during the time of worship in the temple. An officer of the king named **Tripurāridēva-Uḍaiyar** is referred to in two inscriptions from the same taluk, No. 411 dated in Vikrama (corresponding to Śaka 1322), and No. 491 dated in Śaka 1326, in the former of which he granted the right of collect- ing taxes in specified *parrus* in Magadai-maṇḍalam. In Śaka 1327, a gift of a tax free village was made to the temple at Tiruppālaippandal for the welfare of the king (no. 413). **Śivandelundān-Śāmantanār** was the officer who was in authority in the Trichinopoly region at this period, and his gift of some land, cows and a silver salver to the Raṅganātha temple at Śrīraṅgam is mentioned in No. 86. This record which is dated in Śaka 1327, Pārthiva, does not mention the name of the Vijayanagara king, who evidently was Bukka II.

**[*Vīrabhūpati-Uḍaiyar.*](cnt3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 62. The next ruler is **Vīrabhūpati-Uḍaiyar,** son of Vīra-Dēvarāya (I), whose records in this year are dated from Śaka 1333 to 1338. One of them from Tiruppālaippandal (No. 409), dated in Śaka 1337 registers a provision made by Mahāpradhāna **Mañjappa-Uḍaiyar** for a service to be conducted in the temple for Tirunāgīṥvaramuḍaiya-Nāyanār for the welfare of his overlord. Another (No. 406) from the same place dated a year later (Śaka 1338) provides for midnight offerings to the god, also for the welfare of the king, by Mahāpradhāna **Annadāta-Uḍaiyar,** son of Chavuṇḍappa-Uḍaiyar. He has figured already in two records from the North Arcot district (No. 568 of 1902 and 209 of 1911), dated in Śaka 1335 and 1339 respectively. In the former record his *gōtra* is specified as Vāsishṭha. From Jambukēṥvaram also two records (Nos. 75 and 76) dated in Śaka 1357 which falls in the time of Bhūpati’s successor Dēvarāya II, refer to the construction of a *gōpura* in that temple by Chauṇḍapēndra, son of Ādityarasa of the same Vāsishṭha.-gōtra *(Ep. Rep.* for 1936-37, para. 56). It may be noted that Chauṇḍaparasa of the Vāsishṭha-gōtra, who is described as the son of Chinnayārya and Kāmāmbā and the (elder) brother of Ādityadēva and Mañchapārya, was the author of the work called *Prayōgaratnamālā,* and that he was a *mantrin* and lived in the reign of Vīra-Bhūpati *(Sources of Vij. Hist.*. p. 54). Ādityarasa also figures in a Chidambaram record (No. 315 of 1913) of the reign of Vīra-Bhūpati.

**[*Devaraya II.*](cnt3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 63. Records belonging to the time of **Dēvarāya-Mahārāya II** are fairly numerous in the collection, and they come mainly from Śrīraṅgam. Two of these are connected with the gift of villages made by the king for worship to god Raṅganātha during the trusteeship of **Uttama-Nambi** and his brother **Chakrarāya** (Nos. 121 and 119). The income from the villages Śuṇḍekkāyi, Kōvattakkuḍi, Toḍeyūr and Karuguḷe are stated to have been made over for the expenses of worship in the temple. The several other benefactions made to the temple by these two persons are also enumerated in a few inscriptions which are in Sanskrit and Tamil verse. No. 84 states that Uttama-Nambi was the recipient, evidently on behalf of the temple, of the presents of a pearl umbrella, a pair of *kāhaḷas and of dīpikās* (lamp-stands), a golden seat, a gold vessel and an ivory shield from king Prauḍha-Dēvarāya. The additions made to the Śrīraṅgam temple during the time of Chakrarāya, the brother of Uttama-Nambi, are mentioned in some records in Tamil verse. He is said to have constructed a portion in the Perumāḷtōlan-tirumaṇḍapa in the temple (No. 80). He cleared the jungle to the east of the temple and colonised the precincts of the temple of Alagiyaṥiṅga. In the Raṅganātha temple itself, he built a *maṇḍapa* in front of the shrine of **Annamūrti** and installed an image of Hanumān a *maṇḍapa* near by, and the image of Lakshmī in the porch which he had erected near the kitchen of the temple (No. 82).

**[*Annamūrti shrine in the Śrīraṅgam temple.*](cnt3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
Another inscription credits him with the consecration of the Daṥāvatāra images in a temple on the southern bank of the Sahyajā (Kāvērī) in Śaka 1360, Kāḷayukti )No. 83).
