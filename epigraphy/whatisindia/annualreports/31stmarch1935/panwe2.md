**THE PANDYAS**

rendered to the Pāņḍya king, is known only from the present record and it is confirmed also by the existence of the records of the Bāņas in the Pudukkōṭṭai state and the surrounding region.

**[*Alagapperumāi, the brother-in-law of  
Māravarman Sundara-Pāņḍya, and of Jaṭāvarman Kulaśēkhara.*](cn2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 Another inscription of the king from Tiruppaṅgili (No. 161), dated in the 9th year and 140th day, with which is also connected No. 160, records-a royal order issued from the seat ‘Malavarāyan in the *Piḷliyarai-kūḍam* of the palace at Tiravaraṅgam at the instance of Aḷagap-perumāḷ, the brother-in-law (of Sundara-Pāņḍya). The order is signed by Uyyaninrāḍuvān alias Kurukularāyan and minister Rāman Pallavarājan of Perumaṇalūr in Aņḍa-nāḍu. Aḷagapperumāḷ mentioned here is also referred to as brother–in–law in a record of Jaṭāvarman Kulaśēkhara beginning with the introduction ‘Pūvinkilatti’ etc. (No. 298 of 1927-28), dated in the 13+14th year of his reign corresponding to A.D. 1217, from Chaturvēdimaṅgalam in the Ramnad district. So also figure Uyyanin- rāḍuvān in No. 548 of 1922 from Tiruttaṅgal and Rāman alias Pallavarāyan in a copper-plate record at Tirupūvaņam (Ep. Rep. for 1899, para. 42 and Ep. Ind .Vol. XXV, p112, text line 113 ) in the same district both belonging to Kulaśēkhara. *Machchālvār* (brother-in–law) Alagapperumāḷ also figures as donor ion a record , dated in the 31st year of Māravarman Kulasēkhara (N0.198) where he is mentioned as hailing from Kiḷaikkoḍumaḷūr alias Madurai-Udaya (Madurōdaya)-nallūr. He might identical with Aḷagap-perumāḷ mentioned above, and the title Māravarman quoted in the record may be a mistake for Jaṭāvarman, as otherwise, the 31st year of Māravarman Kulaśēkhara, i.e., A.D. 1299 would give him an impossible date. Jaṭāvarman Kulaśēkhara’s (accn.1190 A.D.) highest regnal year is known to be 31+3rd (No. 431 of 1929-30 from Āttūr in the Tinnevelly district).

**[*Jaṭāvarman Sundara-Pāņḍya I: his benefactions  
to the Śriraṅgam temple.*](cn2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 28. A few inscriptions of Jaṭāvarman Sundara-Pāņḍya I have been secured this year also from Śrīraṅgam in addition to those of previous years. Of these No. 84 assignable to this king is dated in the 10th year and 45th day and records a royal order issued to his officer Vāṇādarāya to appoint the *Āriyar* and the *Uḷḷūrār* to guard the treasuries (Porkāral) of the temple of Raṅganātha from the month of Āvaṇi in the 10th year of the.. king, The management of this temple which was hitherto vested with one group *(kottu)* of officials was now extended to members of the other groups *(kottus)* also. No. 89 secured from the same temple and dated in the next month *(i.e.* Puraṭṭādi of the 10th year gives more explicit information on the subject. This inscription begins with the introduction *‘Samasta Jagadādhāra ‘* etc.,and purports to be an order issued at the request of the king by the God himself while seated with his consorts on the ‘Bhūpālarāyan ’ lion–throne in the bea- chamber of the temple. It states that the administration of the temple was hitherto conducted by a body of ten persons belonging to the *Kōvaņavar-kottu.* The benefactions of the king are then recounted.

**[*Management of the temple property.*](cn2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 Sundara-Pāņḍya is said to have defined the activities of the temple, made gifts as *aḍukkaḷaippuram* for the maintenance of the kitchen, instituted services, gilded the *vi nānas* like *Śrīraṅgavimāna* as also Sundara-Pāņḍyan-madil and the *gōpura,* made duplicate sets of ornaments for the god, constructed a palanquin (śi igai ) and presented several other articles made of gold. This increase in the wealth of the temple necessitated closer supervision and consequently a change in the management, which was now entrusted to a body of ten, not exclusively of the *Kōvaņavar* as hitherto, but selected 2 from the *Kōvaṇavar,* 2 from *Srīraṅgamaraīyōr,* 1 from *Toduvattuttūmaraiyōr,* 2 from *Taḷai iḍuvār,* I from *Kāśal-Ariyar* and 2 from *Araṭṭi -mukki-Aņukkar.* The inscription is attested by the Royal Secretary Kaņņuḍaiyān Pallavan Viḷupparaiyan of Puduchchēri, and it is said to have been engraved at the instance of Śriraṅganārāyaṇa-Dāsan, Māttūr-kilavan Kurukulattaraiyan, the manager of the temple *(vīṭṭukkāriyamārāygira), the Kōvaṇavar and the Kuḍavar.*

**[*Vira-Pāṇḍya , ruler of Koṅkaṇa.*](cn2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 29. Another interesting record from Śrīraṅgam (No.81) states that this Pāņḍya king defeated the Kēraḷa and Hoysaḷa kings, and that he **made his younger brother Vira-Pāņḍya the ruler of Koṅkaṇa-rājya.** There was a Vīra-Pāņḍya with the initial date A.D. 1254, who claims to have conquered the
