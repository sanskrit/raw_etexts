****PANDYAS****

Abhimuktīśvaram-uḍaiyān. A donor to the temple in the time of Māravarman Kulaśēkhara was Āṇḍapirān Tirunelvēli-uḍaiyān of Pālūr *alias* Rājakēsarinallūr who presented to the god a *paṭṭam* of eight *Kalañju* of gold and endowed lands for offerings and worship to the deity on the festival of Pushya in the month of Tai (No. 171). During the War of the Pāṇḍya Succession, when the Singhalese general Laṅkāpura-Daṇḍanāyaka is said to have occupied Tiruppattūr, the worship in the temple should have been affected. It suffered a worse fate when it was occupied by the Muhammadans in the 14th century. They struck panic in the country, destroyed the temple and desecrated the images therein. A certain Viśālayadēvar of Kunraikkuḍi (modern Kunnakkuḍi) repaired the damages done and reconsecrated the images in the 46th year of Jaṭāvarman alias Tribhuvanachakravartin Vīra-Pāṇḍya (Nos. 119 and 120 of 1908), for which he earned the gratitude of the people of Tiruppattūr. They in recognition of his services, assigned him a specified quantity of corn from the harvest reaped by each cultivator and also conferred on him certain privileges and honours in the temple of Tiruttaḷiyāṇḍa-Nāyanar.

**[Jaṭāvarman Kulaśēkhara I.](contents3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
49. Seven inscriptions (Nos. 167, 168, 185, 187, 188, 189 and 190) of Kulaśēkhara without any distinguishing epithets for their identification have been secured from this place. The latest date for this king in the collection is 13 + 10th year (Nos. 187 and 188). From the astronomical details based on a single record from this village (No. 101 of 1908), Sewell, following Swamikannu Pillai, accepted A.D. 1161-62 as the date of accession for one Kulaśēkhara (Ind. Ant., Vol. XLIV, p. 255) and identified him with the ruler of the same name who took a prominent part in the War of the Pāṇḍya Succession. But it is known that this war arose about the 5th year of Rājādhirāja II (No. 20 of 1899) i.e. about A.D. 1167 and that this Kulaśēkhara was deposed about the 12th year of Rājādhirāja II i.e. about A.D. 1175 from the Pāṇḍyat throne which he never got back (Ep. Ind., Vol. XXVI, p. 87). The Kulaśēkhara of the present collection cannot be I identified with this king since the latter’s regnal year did not extend to 13 + 10th year or A.D. 1161 + 23 (= 1184 A.D.), but as pointed out above had ended by about A.D. 1175. Further, the officer Kaṇḍan Ālvuḍaiyān *alias* Kalvāyil-Nāḍālvān (No. 187) figures also in a record of the 3rd year of Jaṭāvarman Kulaśēkhara (acc. A.D. 1190) commencing with the introduction *Pūvin-kilatti* etc. *(Inscriptions of the Pudukkottai State,* No. 246). Since the astronomical details given in two of the records of thīs place (Nos. 188 and 189) point to A.D. 1190 as the initial year of Kulaśēkhara, almost all the records of the king of this name secured this year may be assigned to Jaṭāvarman Kulasēkhara I (acc. 1190 A.D.). In some of these inscriptions, prominent mention is made of two of his officers *viz.,* Kaṇḍan Ālvuḍaiyān *alias* Kalvāyil-Nāḍālvān (Nos. 187 and 168) and Mummudiśōlan Māḷavar-māṇikkam *alias* Māḷāva-chakravarti (Nos. 167 and 188). Besides these, we already know of two officers of this king who served in the region round about Tiruppattūr *viz.,* Tiruvālandurai-uḍaiyān and Tirukkoḍuṅkunram-uḍaiyān *alias* Nishadarājan of Pon-Amarāvati (No. 100 of 1908) Kalvāyil- Nāḍālvān of the year’s collection had his *Kāṇipparru* in Kaṭṭi-ēri (No. 187) and Teṇvāy-Iḍaikkuḍi (No. 168), both situated in Pūngunra-nāḍu. Since he also figures in an inscription of the 8th year of Sundara-Pāṇḍya “who presented the Chōḷa country” secured from Tirumayyam in the Pudukkottai State (No. 269 of *Pudukkottai Incrcs),* he seems to have continued in power till about A.D. 1224 and had his jurisdiction in the regions round Tirumayyam and Tiruppattūr. The other officer Mummuḍiśōlan Māḷava-māṇikkam alias Māḷavachchakravartti is said to have had a share of the *Kaṇippaṛṛu* of Tenvāy-Iḍaikkuḍi, evidently with Kalvāyil-Nāḍālvān mentioned above (No. 167).

**[Chiefs of Sembonmari.](contents3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
The chiefs of **Sembonmari** in the Tiruppattur taluk seem to have been known by the surname Māḷavachchakravartti. The *Mahāvaṁśa* states that the Singhalese general Laṅkāpura-Daṇḍanāyaka into whose hands fell the fortress of Sembonmāri subsequently gave it back to a certain Māḷavachchakravartti.
