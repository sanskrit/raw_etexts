****CHOLAS OF THE RENANDU COUNTRY AND VAIDUMBAS.****

[***The* Madras Museum plates of Srikantha-Choḷa.**](contents.html#_ftnref1100)  
7. From the Superintendent, Government Museum, Madras, was received during the year for review a set of copper-plates which contains three inscriptions of three different kings (Nos. 5 to 7 of App. A). The plates which are five in number measure 9 ¾ inches by 31/8” to 3 ¼” and have slightly raised rims all round. They are strung together on an elliptical copper-ring measuring 2 ½” by 2 7I8”. This passes through a ring-hole about ¾” in diameter, but unfortunately no seal is attached to the ring.

The first which is the earliest of the three records is engraved on the inner side of the first plate, both the sides of the second and the third plates and on the upper half of the first side of the fourth plate. The second of the records is commenced on the second side of the fourth plate and continued and concluded on the lower half of the first side of the fourth plate. It is therefore evident that when this record was engraved the fifth plate was not in the set but must have been tagged on subsequently. It is also likely that the original seal, if any, that must have naturally belonged to the first set was removed or tampered with when this was tagged on, either wantonly or unwittingly. This suggestion seems to gain support from the fact that the third (and latest) of these inscriptions is of a different dynasty from the one to which the first two belong. At the back of the fifth plate is carved the figure of a shrine containing in it a *linga* on a pedestal and a **standing bull** in front. The set with the ring weighs 177 tolas.

The fi rst of thSe inscriptions belongs to king **Srikantha** whose genealogy is traced from Brahman, through Marīchi and other mythological down
