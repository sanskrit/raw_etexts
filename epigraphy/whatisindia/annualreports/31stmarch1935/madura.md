**THE MADURA NAYAKAS**

65. A few copper-plates and stone epigraphs belonging to this family were examined during the year. As Trichinopoly acquired the importance of a secondary capital of the later Madura Nāyakas, some of whom were ardent Vaishṇavas, it is but natural that Śrīraṅgam should have been the object of their patronage and received many munificent donations from them. The numerous fresco panels illustrating scenes from the *Rāmāyaṇa* and the *Mahābhārata* appear to have been painted on the ceilings and walls of some *maṇḍapas* of the Raṅganātha temple at Śrīraṅgam during this period, and portraits of some Nāyaka rulers and their officers introduced in these paintings have descriptive labels in Telugu below them, which, though obliterated in several places owing to neglect, can still be useful for purposes of identification. At Jambukēśvaram also a few records of this family are found.

**[*Virappa-Nāyaka ; Śaka 1517.*](cont3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 No. 136 from the latter place dated in Śaka 1517 belongs to the time of Viśvanātha Kṛishṇa Vīrappa-Nāyaka, *i.e.,* Vīrappa-Nāyaka, son of Kṛishṇappa and grandson of Viśvanātha-Nāyaka. It states that the image of **Kaṅkāḷanātha** in the temple was consecrated by the Nāyaka ruler, and that certain taxes payable by those who had newly settled near the place called Koṇḍayampēṭṭai were remitted in favour of the temple for a day’s expenses during the principal *Brahmōtsavaṁ.* We also incidentally learn that the *Cheṭṭi* merchants were given some facilities for colonising near the Tirunīriṭṭān-tirumadil. The details of date given in the record yield the equivalent A.D. 1595, November 20. The *Mṛityuñjaya* manuscript dates Vīrappa’s death in Āvaṇi in the cyclic year Manmatha which but from the present record we have to infer that he lived nearly two months longer. The Tirunīriṭṭān-tirumadil is now called the *‘Vibhūti-prākaraâ€™.*

**[*Chokkanatha-Nayaka, his five queens.*](cont3.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 66. From a stone inscription from Śrīraṅgam (No. 2) we learn that five ladies by name Maṅgammavāru, Muddu-Chandrarēkhammavāru, Kamalājammavāru, Jānakammavāru, and Induvadanammavāru were the wives of Chokkanātha-Nāyaka. The inscription is somewhat peculiar in that it does not register any endowment made to the temple, but simply states that the ladies prayed to god Raṅganātha for the welfare of their husband and for marital felicity. The slab containing this epigraph which must have been originally in a standing position, was probably built into the pavement round the inner circuit quite close to the central shrine during the repairs conducted some time later in the Nāyaka period.
