 [](cont.html#_ftnref1100)9. In the Madras Presidency 283 villages were visited during the year, of which 81 yielded a collection of 373 inscriptions. The whole of the Repalle taluk of the Guntur district was surveyed. while the balance of the Punganur taluk of the Chittoor district which had been left over from previous years was completed. Good progress was also made in the survey of the Tirukkoyilur taluk of the South Arcot district. In the Bombay-Karnataka the epigraphical survey of the Sindigi taluk comprising 151 villages was taken up and finished during the year. Includeing a few inscriptions in Bijapur and Aṇṇigeri the collection in this area comes to 98 inscriptions. Thus the total collection of stone epigraphs for the year was 471. Besides these 13 copperplates were also examined and 91 photographs of antiquarian and sculpture interest were taken.

  
 Inscriptions at Kulekomaṭgi and Malghāna belonging to the later Chāḷu- kyan period record gift to shrines dedicated to Āditya. Another place deserving of mention is Chaṭṭarki with its temple of Dattātrēya. The principle deity which is still under worship is a beautiful figure with only one face and 6 arms, two of which are holding the Vaishṇava attributes of śaṅkha and chakra, while two others have the Śaiva emblems, viz., ḍamaru and triśūla. At Koṇḍaguḷi is a Hanumān temple with a fine sculpture of an emaciated female figure probably Chaṇḍikā, profusely decorated with ornaments and represented with hanging breasts and two arms and a garland of skulls and standing in a fighting pose.
