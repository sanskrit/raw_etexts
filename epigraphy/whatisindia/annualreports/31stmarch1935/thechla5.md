**THE CHOLAS**

(Ep. Rep. 1929-30, Part II, para. 24). Another such pact is registered in No. 502, dated in the 13th year of Kulōttuṅga who is evidently Kulōttuṅga III.

**[*A political of his time.*](cnt2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 It is a counterpart of No. 440 of 1913 registering a political alliance entered into between the chiefs **Rājarājadēvan** Ponparappinān alias Kulōtuṅga-ChōḷaVāṇakōvaraiyar and Sūryadēvar Nirērrār *alias* Rājarāja-Malaiyakularāyar of Kiḷiyūr, same as Periya-uḍaiyān Nīrērrān of No. 364 mentioned above. This is engraved on the walls of the temple at Elavānāśūr in the South Arcot district which should have been an important stronghold of the Malayamān chiefs and gives the terms of the pact as agreed to be fulfilled by Ponparappinān. Similarly the other inscription is found at Āragaḷūr which should have been the headquarters of this Ponparappinān, and the terms of the document are those as given by the Malayamān chief on his part. The present inscription is a well preserved and complete record while the Āragalūr version consists only of disconnected piece of the document.

 No. 374 from Neyvaṇai in the same district is dated in the 8th year of Kulōttuṅga and records the grant of the village Edirmalaippāḍi to the temple for offerings to the goddess and for a festival in the Puraṭṭāśi month, made by Nandipanman alias Naralōkasūriyan who also figures in No. 375, probably of the same king, as the servant of Araiśan Ālappirandān alias Kāḍavarāyan with the permission of the latter after getting it exemp ed from the sammādam-tax by Chēdiyarāyar. Edirmalaippāḍi is referred to as the place where the god is said to have gone and received Āḷuḍaiya-Piḷḷaiyār (Tirujñānasambanda), and the god of this temple is called Porkuḍaṅkuḍuttaruḷina i.e., ‘who was pleased to give the golden pot.’ These two names seem to contain in them references to the incidents connected with the sojourn of saint Jñānasambanda at this place. No 489, dated in the king’s 30th year gives details of date which work out correctly for A. D. 1207, August 19th . This inscription records gift of a village to the dancing girls for the service of dancing and singing in the temple at Iraiyānaraiyur.

**[*His subordinates.*](cnt2.html#_ftnref1100)**  
 A few feudatory chief who are known to have been administering part of the present North and South Arcot districts in the reigns of Kulōttuṅga III and his successor figure in the present year’s collection also. One such chief was Kūḍalūr Āḷappirandān Rājagambhīra-Kāḍavarāyan *alias* **Alagiyapallavan Śāḍumperumāḷ** who is stated in No. 496, dated in the 30th year of the king to have constructed the outer *gōpura* of the temple at Elavānāśūr. Another Pallava chieftain named Kūḍal Aḷappirandān Kāḍavarāyan, who had also the title of Śāḍumperumāḷ is mentioned in two inscriptions from Tiruvaṇṇāmalai (S. I. I., Vol. VIII, Nos. 77 and 98) dated in the 31st year of Rājarāja III and the 15th year of Kōpperuñjiṅgadēva. Another subordinate chief of Kulōttuṅga III was the Kiḷiyūr Malaiyamān chief Periyuḍaiyān Rājarāja-Kōvalrāyan Palavāyuda- \[Pal\]lava\[raiyan\], son of Iraiyūran Rājarāja-Chēdiyarāyan Vanniyarnāyan (No. 381), who is stated to have dug a tank at Attippākkam in the South Arcot district. This chief is also known to us from No. 389 of 1902. Still another feudatory of the king was **Magadēśan Rājarājadēvan Ponparappinān** of Āragaḷūr whose servant Māran Kulaindān Chēdirāyan is stated (in No. 407) to have made a gift of lands to the Tiruppālaippandal temple in the 26th year of Kulōttuṅga. We find two inscriptions of this same **Ponparapina- Magadaipperumāḷ** without mention of any overlord but dated in the **6th and 15th year** of his own rule in the same place (No. 402 and 408). The 11th regnal year of this chief is quoted in No. 156 of 1904, also from the same place.

 No. 397 is a record from Meyyūr in the Tirukkoyilur taluk (South Arcot district) dated in the 9th year of a certain Vanneñjapperumāḷ. He appears to be identical with the person of the same name figuring in an inscription from Āttūr in the Salem district (No. 405 of 1913), as a subordinate issuing the grant in the 32nd year of an unspecified king, who was probably kulōttuṅga III. The chief should have asserted his independence towards the close of Kulōttuṅga’s reign and issued grants independently, as testified to in the present inscription.
