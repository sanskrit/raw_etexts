**INTRODUCTION**

son of a Gūrjara Brāhmaṇa named Śatānanda of the Kṛishṇātrēya *gōtra.* Chandradēva is further described as an ornament *(tilaka)* of the Yādava feudatories and is also called *Kharahastamalla.* Mention is indirectly made of the success of the brothers against the *Sindhu-nṛipati* Jayakēśin and against the rulers of Kōṅkaṇa, Gōpaka and Nēpāla. The record has been published in *Ep. Ind.,* Vol. XXVII, pp. 208ff.

As regards records received for examination from territories outside India, impressions of as many as eleven copper-plate grants ( Nos. 31 to 42) were secured from the Curator, Dacca Museum, East Pakistan. Of these No. 36 is the celebrated Guṇaighar (Tippera District) plate of Vainyagupta, dated the 24th day of Pausha in the Gupta year 188 (507 A.D.). It was published in *Ind. Hist. Quart.,* Vol. VI, pp. 45 ff. Nos. 31 and 32 belong to the Buddhist king Śrīchandra of the Chandra dynasty of Bengal. They are dated respectively in the 35th and the 46th years of the king’s reign. The text of No. 31, from Dhullā, has not yet been edited ; but the inscription was noticed in the *Inscriptions of Bengal,* Vol. III, pp. 165-66. No. 32, from Madanpur (Dacca District), has been edited in *Ep. Ind.,* Vol XXVIII, pp. 51 ff. and Plate. The learned editor has wrongly read the date of the record as the year 44. No. 38, from Madanpārā (Faridpur District), belongs to king Viśvarūpasēna, son of the celebrated Sēna monarch Lakshmaṇasēna (circa 1179-1206 A.D.) of Bengal. The inscription was secured by the Asiatic Society of Bengal and was published in the Society’s journal, 1896, Part i, pp. 6-15. Sometime afterwards it was found missing from the Society’s collection and was regarded as lost. Its re-examination has now revealed certain new facts relating to the history of Eastern India. It is now found that many passages of the inscription are re-engraved on erasures. The original writings that were erased for re-engraving certain new passages, so far as they could be deciphered, suggest that the grant was originally issued by king Sūryasēna, son of Viśvarūpasēna, during the second year of his reign and that the re-engraving was done during the 14th regnal year of Viśvarūpasēna. For a discussion on these and some other points, see *JAS,* Letters, Vol. XX, pp. 209ff. No. 42 is a new record of Daśarathadēva, which discloses the name of his queen Kandarpadēvī for the first time.

**INSCRIPTIONS ON STONE AND OTHER MATERIALS  
Stone Inscriptions**

 Among stone inscriptions secured during the year, the following are interesting. At Bhilsa in Madhya Bharat was copied a damaged inscription in Sanskrit, engraved in Nāgarī characters of about the 11th century (No. 118). It contains a eulogy of the sun-god composed by *Mahākavichakravartin Paṇḍita* Chhittapa. This poet, probably a contemporary and court poet of the Paramāra king Bhōja (c. 1010-55 A.D.), was hitherto known only from certain Sanskrit anthologies. The present epigraph brings to light for the first time a composition of the poet, which may be regarded as a *khaṇḍakāvya.* It has been published in *Ep. Ind.,* Vol. XXX, pp. 219ff.

 No. 290 from Nāyakallu (Kurnool District), bearing the date Śaka 889, Prabhava, solar eclipse (967 A.D., July 10), refers to the reign of AkālavarshaPṛithvīvallabha who may be identical with Rāshṭrakūṭa Kṛishṇa III of the Maḷkhēḍ branch. If the recording of the date and identification of the king are correct, this epigraph extends the known reign-period of the king by a few months. It has, however, to be noted that this date conflicts with the details given in a stone inscription from Koḷagallu ( Bellary District), which states that by the time of the record, viz. Śaka 889 (current) Kshaya, Phālguna, śu. 6, Sunday (967 A.D., February 17), Kṛishṇa III was already dead and his successor Khoṭṭiga was ruling *(Ep. Ind.,* Vol. XXVI. p. 165 and n.). The Nāyakallu record introduces the chief *Mahāsāmanta* Nanni-Saḷukki Rāchamalla, evidently of the Chāḷukya family, as a subordinate of the king in the area in question.

 The epigraphical survey of the Tiruvallur Taluk, Chingleput District, Madras State, which was continued this year also, has yielded a number of Pallava, Chōḷa and Vijayanagara records. Among the Pallava inscriptions, a record of Aparājitavarman (No. 236) dated in his 5th regnal year was discovered amidst the ruins of a dilapidated temple at Paṭṭaraipperumbudūr. The epigraph refers to the temple of god Kumbhakarṇīśvara and registers the gift of a piece of land as *balippaṭṭi* to the servants of the temple. Evidently the ruined temple, in which this inscription was found, was the temple of Kumbhakarṇīśvara mentioned in the inscription. No. 259 built into the ceiling of the *ardhamaṇḍapa* of the
