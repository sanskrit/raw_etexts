**INTRODUCTION**

Bogaya and Vallaiya is not clearly stated in the inscription. They may be related to each other as father and son. But an inscription *(Ep. Carn.,* Vol. IV, Kr. 63) from Gōvindanhaḷḷi, dated Śaka 1159 (1237 A. D.), describes two generals named Bōgayya and Mallayya as sons of Kētana and as recipients, from king Sōmēśvara, of a grant of eleven villages which they, in their turn, conferred on several Brāhmaṇas in the presence of god Śrī-Rāmanātha at Sētu. In view of the proximity of the date of this record to that of the inscription under review, it may be surmised that Bōgayya and Mallayya may be identical with Bōgaya and Vallaiya of the Śrīraṅgam epigraph, in which case Mallayya will have to be construed as another form of Vallaiya. It is not unlikely too that, of the two brothers Bōgaya and Mallaya of the Gōvindanhaḷḷi record, the former’s (i. e. Bōgayya’s) son was Vallaiya.

A fragment of a Chōḷa epigraph (No. 168) on the outer tiers of the *Nālikēṭṭān-Vāsal* is of some interest. It seems to refer to the settlement of accounts amounting to 940 *kāśu,* for the non-payment of which Pāradāyan Tiruvaraṅga-Purushōttaman suffered imprisonment *(śirai-irundu).* The accounts, as the record says, were settled by the officer Rājēndrachōḷa-Mūvēndavēḷār. The epigraph affords an instance of punishment by imprisonment, not commonly met with in inscriptions.

 Two large stone pillars in the passage of the *Nālikēṭṭānvāśal* bear epigraphs surmounted by graffito designs, one of which represents a rampant tiger with open mouth, raised right foot and twisted tail, and the other the mythical bird *Gaṇḍabhēruṇḍa.* The inscription (No. 177) engraved below the latter emblem is too damaged to yield any information. All that could possibly be said is that it mentions Kaṇṇanur.

 No. 179, engraved in characters of about the 15th century A. D. below the design of a rampant tiger, is a Chēra record which commences with a Sanskrit verse giving a genealogical account of the Kēraḷa king Champaka. It describes him as the daughter’s son *(dauhitra)* of king Jayasiṁha, son of Gōdēśvara, the sister’s son of Kulaśēkhara and the brother of Mārttāṇḍa. A bilingual inscrip- tion (Nos. 126 and 127 of 1905) on a bell in the Nambi temple at Tirukkuruṅguḍi in the Tirunelvēli District dated in Kollam 644 (1469 A. D.) mentions the Chēra king Āditya as the donor of the bell and traces his descent from the lineage of Jayasiṁha *(Jayasiṁh-ānvaya).* It is difficult to determine whether this Āditya is to be regarded as identical with the donor Champaka of the record under review, which, we may note, specifies his matrilineal descent from Jayasiṁha. An inscrip- tion (No. 30 of 1925) from Mūvalūr in the Mayavaram Taluk, Tanjore District, contains some verses in Tamil said to have been composed at the instance of Chēramān Perumāḷ Vañchi-marttāṇḍan Tiruppāmūtta-Tiruvaḍi who is described as an adept in all arts *(akhila-kalā-vallabha).* He is perhaps identical with Mārttāṇḍa, mentioned in the record under review. The significance of the tiger crest, which is the emblem of the Chōḷas, above this epigraph is inexplicable.

 No. 197 is a fragmentary record of king Harihara II of Vijayanagara. It opens with a Sanskrit verse containing the chronogram *Rājyalōkē* for Śaka 1312 which is expressed also in numerals in the Tamil portion of the inscription. It records a gift of a *tūkku-viḷakku* (hanging lamp) and 30 cows to the deity by Aṇṇappauḍaiyar, son of Viṭṭharasa of the Vasta *gōtra.* We learn from another record (A. R. Ep., No. 72 of 1938-39) from the same temple, dated six years later than the present epigraph, that Aṇṇappa was responsible for the construction of the pavement to the 1000-pillared *maṇḍapa* in the temple, the consecration of god Viṭṭhala therein and the gilding of the central shrine and also the gift of an aureola and provision for offerings to and worship of the god.

 No. 206, which is in Sanskrit verse in Grantha characters, mentions Dēvarāya as the ruling sovereign and the chief Sāḷuva, son of Guṇḍa (III) and Māḍāmbikā and grandson of Maṅgu. The record is not dated. Sāḷuva is obviously Narasiṁha, a scion of the Sāḷuva family. Dēvarāya, the overlord of Sāḷuva according to the present record, is stated to be the son of Vijayēśvara. The earliest known date for Sāḷuva Narasiṁha being 1456 A. D. *(A. R. Ep.,* No. 253 of 1904), Dēvarāya of the present record may be identified with Mallikārjuna (1446-1466 A. D.) who is also known as Immaḍi-Dēvarāya and whose father Dēvarāya II had the title Vijaya (Sewell, Hist. Ins. S. Ind., p. 215). The *Sāḷuvābhyudayam* of Rājanātha Ḍiṇḍima gives the name of Sāḷuva Narasiṁha’s mother as Mallāmbikā which is possibly a variant of *Māḍāmbikā.* The inscription stops abruptly with the mere mention of this chief who calls himself a *bhūmiramaṇa.*
