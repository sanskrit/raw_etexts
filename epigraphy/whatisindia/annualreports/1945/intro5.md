**INTRODUCTION**

A late inscription (No. 235) in the Saṅgamēśvara temple at Bhavāni, Coim- batore District, dated in Śaka 1725 may be reviewed here. It records the gift of an ivory cot to the shrine of the goddess Vēdanāyakī by William Garrow, who was at that time the Collector of the District. the record bears at its end the signature of the donor and the date. XI January, 1804.

 Two inscriptions (Nos. 186 and 187), about half a century later than the one reviewed above also deserve notice as they provide us with contemporary epi- graphical evidence of the military operations connected with the Great Indian Mutiny of 1857. They are epitaphs in Tamil on two tomb-stones from Slee- manābād, Jabalpur District, Madhya Pradesh and record the death of two sepoys, one by name Rāmasāmi, who was a gun-lascar of the T-Company and the other named Daniel who belonged to the 3rd company of the Madras Native Infantry. Both these inscriptions are published in *Indian Historical Quarterly.* Vol. XXVIII, pp. 362 ff.
