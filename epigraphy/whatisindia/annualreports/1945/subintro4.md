**INTRODUCTION**

The epigraphical survey of the Bombay-Karnatak was continued. This embodies mainly the results of the survey of the Bankapur taluk of the Dharwar District.

 In these records are represented the main dynasties of the Karnatak, viz. Western Chāḷukyas, Rāshṭrakūṭas, Kalachuris, Yādavas, Hoysaḷas and Vijayanagara kings. The earliest record of the collection comes from Beḷgali in Bankapur taluk and is a fragmentary inscription of the time of the Western Chāḷukya king Kīrtivarman, probably Kīrtivarman II (No. 277). An inscription found at Arshinaguppi in Hangal taluk, belonging to the

time of the Rāshṭrakūṭa king Amōghavarsha I and dated Śaka 781, Pramāthin, registers a grant made by the king’s subordinate Baṅkeya to the god of the place Kiruguppudūr (No 207). We learn from the copper plate record of Kadamba Kṛishṇavarman II (published in the *Digest of Annual Report on Kannada Research in Bombay Province* for the year 1940-41, pp. 3-5) that he granted the village of Kirukuppaṭūr situated in Pāntipura-*vishaya.* According to the editor of these plates, Kirukuppaṭūr has to be located near Kubṭūr in Shimoga taluk of the Mysore Province which adjoins Hangal taluk. But the correct reading of the place-name appears to be Kirukuppudūr. Thus the Rāshṭrakūṭa inscription at Arshinaguppi, whose ancient name was Kiruguppudūr, enables us to identify *Kirukuppudūr* of the Kadamba plates with the modern Arshinaguppi, about 10 miles from Hangal. Pāntipura or Pāṅktipura*-vishaya* comprised roughly the modern Hangal taluk.

 As many as 25 inscriptions were copied at the village Tiḷiwaḷḷi in the Hangal taluk. The records mention the names of a number of learned Brāhmaṇas indicating that Tiḷiwaḷḷi, which is called an *agrahāra,* must have been an important seat of learning.
