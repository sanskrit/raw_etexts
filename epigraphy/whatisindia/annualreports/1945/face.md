**PREFACE**

The present is the first issue of the *Annual Report on Indian Epigraphy.* This publication replaces the *Annual Report on South Indian Epigraphy* that is to be discontinued after its issue for the year ending 31st March 1945.

The new series will have a wider scope than the one it replaces, for it will no longer confine itself to South India but will embrace the whole of India. The introduction of the Report will take the place of the epigraphical resume published in the *Annual Reports of the Archaeological Survey of India* up to the year 1936-37, when the publication of that series was stopped. For the important epigraphical discoveries in the intervening period, the reader is advised to see the article ‘Ten Years of Indian Epigraphy’, published in *Ancient India* (the Bulletin of the Department), No. 5 (January, 1949).

 It is needless to point out that the two headings **Copper plates** and **Stone Inscriptions** have been adopted only as convenient terms, while, in reality, they cover the whole range of epigraphy, the former applying to the inscriptions engraved on metal in whatever form and the latter to those incised on stone, brick, terracotta, earthenware, etc.

 Enquiries from interested scholars as to further details regarding the inscriptions listed here will be most welcome and will as usual, receive courteous attention.
