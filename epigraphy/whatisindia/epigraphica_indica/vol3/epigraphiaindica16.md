****RANGANATHA INSCRIPTION OF SUNDARA-PANDYA.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

......(V. 15.) The king who was the Chief of the world (*and*) the conqueror of (*all*) foes, made for the god Madhuripu (Vishṇu) at **Raṅga** a large movable trough (*prapâ*) of gold, which, like the dawn, indicates, by masses of rays that are spreading on all sides, that the moon of his fames is rising simultaneously in (*all*) the eight cardinal points.

......(V. 16.) The Sun among kings made for the highest being which is fond of staying at **Raṅga**, a golden (*image of*) Suparṇa (**Garuḍa**), by whose bright splendour, as (*by that*) of (*his*) elder brother,¹ a permanent dawn appears to reign in the world.

......(V. 17.) The Sun among kings placed on the body of Kaṁsadvish (Vishṇu), who reposes at **Raṅga**, a golden under-garment. Covered by its rays, the Creator, who rests on (*the god’s*) navel, appears to dwell once more in the golden egg (*from which he was produced*).

......(V. 18.) The Sun among kings gave to the lord **Raṅga** a lofty golden aureola (*prabhâ-valaya*) of great beauty, which, placed near him, resembles a lovely group of blowing *aśôka* (trees), with *tamâla* (trees) between.

......(V. 19.) Placed on the golden pedestal (*pîṭhî*), which the Sun among kings had given (*to him*), (*and*) which was adorned with various jewels, and bearing the lofty aureola (*prabhâ*), the lord of **Raṅga** surpasses a black cloud which bears a rainbow (*and*) rests on the peak of the Golden Mountain (Mêru).

......(V. 20.) In the month of Chaitra, the Sun among kings celebrated for **Raṅgin** the processsion-festival (*yâtr-ôtsava*), which is praiseworthy on account of bright, wonderful, and prosperous days. It is no wonder (*that*) those who possess intelligence, rejoice, when even the trees, which are devoid of intelligence, are in high glee (*or* in full flower).

......(V. 21.) In order to celebrate the festival of the sporting (*vihâr-ôtsava*) of (*the god*) who dwells at **Raṅga**, with Kamalâ (Lakshmî), king **Sundara-Pâṇḍyadêva** built of hold a new ship. Through the trees which grow on the banks (*and*) which are covered with its (*the ship’s*) splendour, the daughter of the **Kavêra** (*mountain*)² resembles the Mandâkinî (Gaṅgâ), whose banks are adorned with groups of *mandâra* trees.

......(V. 22.) The Sun among kings, who had covered the circle of the coast that formed the surrounding wall of the earth, which had become (*his*) residence, with the fame of his victories,— covered the high inner wall of the shrine (*sadman*) of Śârṅgin, who is the lord of **Raṅga**, with masses of gold, which (*he*) had brought from (*his*) wars.

......(V. 23.) The large (*and*) long dining-hall (*abhyavahâra-maṇḍapa*),³ which king **Sundara-Pâṇḍya** had constructed in front (*of the shrine*) of the god who is the lord of **Raṅga**, did not suffice for accommodating the golden vessels (*parichchhada*), which, taking away the wealth of kings, that same (*king*) had provided.

......(V. 24.) The Sun among kings placed on the body of the lord of **Raṅga**, from the feet to the crest, ornaments of jewels, through which Padmâ (Lakshmî), though leaning on his breast, appears to have again entered the mine of jewels (*i.e.* the ocean, from which she arose).

......(V. 25.) While, having crushed the enemies of order in war, **Sundara-Pâṇḍyadêva**, whose bow was (*ever*) ready for action, protected the world,- the golden armour which he gave to Vishṇu, who dwells at **Raṅga**, was a (*mere*) ornament.⁴

......¹ Aruṇa, the charioteer of the Sun.  
......² *i.e.* the Kâvêrî river. Compare verse 28.  
......³ The author uses *maṇḍapa* as a neuter, which suggests that he was a Southerner.  
......⁴ The armour was not required in earnest, as the king bad already destroyed the *dharmadvishaḥ* (enemies of order, or demons), with whom Vishṇu formerly used to fight.
