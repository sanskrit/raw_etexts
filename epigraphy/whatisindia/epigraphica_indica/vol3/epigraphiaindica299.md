......¹ \[*Raṭṭapâṭî* is a Sanskṛitised form of the Draviḍian *Iraṭṭapâḍi,* the designation of the empire of the Râshṭrakûṭas and, later on, of the Western Châlukyas ; see, *e.g., South-Indian Inscriptions,* Vol. I. pp. 63 and 96, and Vol. II. pp. 8 and 94.— E. H.\]— Compare with *Raṭṭapâṭîm=anuśâsati* the pharse *kathâvabhasê* (or *kathâvaśêshê* ?) *sati Raṭṭa-râjyê,* in line 20 of the grant of Aparâjita, page 272 above.  
......² Read *Garutmad-datta-jîvitaḥ,* similar to *sva-śarîra-dânat, ibid.* line 22 ; or, perhaps, *Garutmad-âta- jîvitaḥ.  * ......³ The sign of the first *akshara* of this name is quite clear in the original, and its right-hand portion undoubtedly is like that of the ordinary sign for *sa* ; but the lower part of it has a peculiar form and looks somewhat like the sign for *la.* I believe that *sa* is intended, but that the engraver’s tool slipped in forming the lower part of the letter, and gave ot thus a somewhat strange appearance. Bal Gangadhar Sastri read the name *Jhalaphulla,* and Dr. Bhandarkar, *Early History of the Dekkan,* p. 93, note 2, would read it *Śaṇaphulla.*  
......⁴ The sign of *anusvâra* in *saṁsâdhanô* is joined on to the letter *j* of *ºtôrjitaḥ* in the preceding line, and looks as if it formed part of it.  
......⁵ Bal Gangadhar Sastri read *dharma-yaśaḥ-paraḥ,* and took the name of the chief to be Dharma.  
......⁶ The *akshara* in brackets might perhaps be read *pa* (instead of *va*) ; but *Valipattana* and *Valinagara* occur in another Salâra inscription ; see above, p. 294, note 6.  
......⁷ Bal Gangadhar Sastri read *tasmât Daiyaparâjô,* and in his translation the name given is â€˜Diyapa Râja.’  
......⁸ Originally -*âsama*- appears to have been engraved, but it has clearly been altered to -*âsanna*-. In the second syllable of the following word *nâlikêr-* the *l* has a rather unusual form.  
......⁹ This *akshara* might also be read *paḥ.*  
......¹⁰ Originally *mê* was engraved, but it clearly appears to have been altered to *nê.* The other *aksharas,* up to the end of the line, are quite distinct in the original, and can only be read as given above ; but the meaning of the compound, beginning with *êka* and ending with *kâṇḍaś,* I do not understand. The passage probably should mean that Avasara, singly, was able to subdue a multitude seem to be used elsewhere. Bal Gangadhar Sastri read *chakramêtraº,* but has not translated the word.  
......¹¹ Bal Gangadhar Sastri’s text has *yêtratya-*. Below, line 57, the word *Chêmûlya* is quite clear I the original.  
......¹² The metre is incorrect here. Between the *aksharas yya* and *ma* another *akshara* seems to have been originally engraved ; but it is quite effaced.  
......¹³ Originally *ºrâjôstyâga*- was engraved, but the sign for *ô* has been struct out again.
