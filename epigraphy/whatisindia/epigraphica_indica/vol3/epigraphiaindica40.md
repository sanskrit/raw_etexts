..............................His descendant, **Saṁgama \[I.\]** (v. 5).  
..............................One of his sons, **Bukka \[I.\]** (v. 6).  
..............................His son by Gaurî, **Harihara \[II.\]** (v. 7).

......(Verse 8.) “By erecting spacious halls (*for the performance*) of the sixteen great gifts,¹ he made the whole world (*bhuvana*) the dwelling (*bhavana*) of (*his*) wife,— (*the goddess of*) Fame.”

......(V. 10.) “Through the wind (*which was produced*) by the flapping of the ears of his elephants on the field of battle, the **Tulushka** (*i.e.* Musalmân) horsemen experienced the fate of cotton (*i.e.* were blown away).”

His son by Nârâyaṇâmbikâ (v. 13), **Dêvarâya \[II.\]** (v. 14).

......He bore the surnames (*biruda*) *Râjâdhirâja, Râjaparamêśvara,* ‘the disgracer of6 kings who break their world,’³ ‘the disgracer of the three kings (of the South),’ ‘the terrifier of hostile kings,’ and ‘the Sultân (*Suratrâṇa*) among Hindû kings’ (vv. 19 and 20).

......(V. 21.) “(*His*) glory is made resplendent by his renowned younger brother **Pratâpa-Dêvarâya,** just as that of Mahêndra by his younger brother Upêndra (Vishṇu).

......(V. 22.) “Having ascended the throne of (*his*) father in the city (*nagara*) called **Vijaya,** whose moat is the holy **Tuṅgabhadrâ,** (*and*) protecting the earth up to the oceans,—

......(V. 23.) “The foremost among the virtuous, the glorious king **Dêvarâya \[II.\]** (*made the following gift*) in the presence of (*the god*) **Śrî-Virûpâksha,** on the bank of the **Tuṅga- bhadrâ** river,—

......¹ See *Ep. Ind.* Vol. I. p. 368, note 58.  
......² The only remarkable point in this verse is the occurrence of the dual *pushpavantau*, ‘the sun and the moon.’ Accordingly to Sanderson’s *Dictionary,* the same word is used in Kanarese in the form *pushpavantau*.  
......³ *Bhâshâtilaṅghi-bhûpâla-bhujaṁga* is a translation of the Kanarese term *bhâshege tappuva râyara gaṇḍa.* On this and on the next *biruda* see *Ep. Ind.* Vol. I. p. 363, and p. 369, notes 61 and 62. A similar obscene term is *râya-râhutta-miṇṇa,* ‘the disgracer of the troopers of (hostile) kings ;’ *Ind. Ant.* Vol. XIII. p. 131, Plate iii.*b*, text line 19.  
......⁴ On this made of expressing numbers see *Ind. Ant.* Vol. IV. p. 207, and Dr. Burnell’s *South-Indian Palæography,* second edition, p. 79.  
......⁵ Maratakanagara is a vulgar form of Marakatanagara, ‘the city of emeralds.’— Bate’s *Hindee Dictionary* and Platts’ *Hindûstânê Dictionary* give both मरकत (*markat*) and मरतक (*martak*). The form मरतक for मरकत occurs also in the Raṅganâtha inscription of Sundara-Pâṇḍya ; *ante*, p. 12, text line 3.
