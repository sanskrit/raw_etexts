****SRAVANA-BELGOLA EPITAPH OF MALLISHENA.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Among Professor Kielhorn’s contributions are ‘various readings’ from a manuscript copy of the present inscription. This copy was made from a palm-leaf MS. at Madras for Professor Bühler, by whom it was presented to the India Office Library.¹ After the publication of Mr. Rice’s *Inscriptions at Śravaṇa-Beḷgoḷa,* Professor Kielhorn recognised at once that the Madras MS. contains a copy of the Mallishêṇa epitaph, an proposed a number of improvements in Mr. Rice’s text on the basis of Professor Bühler’s copy.² It appears from Professor Kielhorn’s ‘various readings’ either that the Madras MS. was copied from the pillar while the latter was still in a state of more perfect preservation than at present, or that the MS. was based on an independent duplicate of the Mallishêṇa epitaph.

......The alphabet of the inscription is **Kanarese.** The upper and lower portions of some letters of the first and last lines, respectively, on each face of the pillar are drawn out into ornamental flourishes. The language is **Sanskṛit,** verse and prose ; only the two last lines are in the **Kanarese** language. The only orthographical peculiarities which deserve to be noted, are that *dh* and *bh,* when doubled, are sometimes written as *dhdh* and *bhbh,* and that *rṇṇa* is written as *rṇna.*³ The object for which the inscription was composed, and the pillar containing it set up, is to perpetuate the memory of the **Jaina** preceptor **Mallishêṇa-Maladhâridêva** (verse 64), who committed religious suicide by *sallêkhanâ* (line 211) or *samâdhi* (l. 212), *i.e.* by prolonged fasting,— which, in his case, lasted three days,— at **Śvêtasarôvara** (v. 72) or **Dhavalasarasatîrtha** (v. 70), *i.e.* at Śravaṇa-Beḷgoḷa.⁴ The date of his death was the day of Svâti, Sunday, the third day of the dark fortnight of Phâlguna of the (expired) **Śâka** year **1050,** which corresponded to the cyclic year **Kîlaka** (v. 72). According to Professor Kielhorn’s calculation,⁵ the European equivalent of this date is **Sunday, the 10th March, A.D. 1129.** The date of the inscription itself is not stated ; but the record cannot have been composed more than a generation after Mallishêṇa’s death, because the composer, **Mallinâtha,** was a lay-disciple of the deceased preceptor (l. 222).

......The account of Mallishêṇa’s suicide is preceded by a sort of historical sketch of the Śravaṇa-Beḷgoḷa branch of the **Digambara** sect of the Jainas. It is not a connected and complete account, and cannot even be proved to be in strictly chronological order. The names of some selected Digambara preceptors are mentioned with much stale and extravagant praise, but not without valuable allusions to contemporary persons and incidents.

......1. The list naturally opens with **Vardhamâna** of the **Nâtha** race, the founder of the **Jaina** religion (v. 1).

......2. Of the three Kêvalins⁶ the inscription mentions only **Gautamasvâmin,** surnamed **Indrabhûti** (v. 2).

......3. The **Śrutakêvalins** (v. 3).

......4. **Bhadrabâhu,** whose disciple was 5. **Chandragupta** (v. 4) ; and 6. **Kauṇḍakunda⁷** (v. 5). In two other Śravaṇa-Beḷgoḷa inscriptions (Nos. 40 and 108 of Mr. Rice’s volume), these three named are mentioned in the same order, and Bhadrabâhu whose pupil was Chandragupta, is called the last of the **Śrutakêvalins.⁸**
