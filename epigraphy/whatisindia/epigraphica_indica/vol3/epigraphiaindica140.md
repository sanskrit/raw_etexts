**TRANSLATION OF No. I.**

......**The officials in Isila** must be wished good health and be addressed thus from **Survaṁṇagiri** \[1\]⁶ (*Suvarṇagiri*) with the words of **the Prince and the officials** (*residing teher*) :―

**First Edict**

......“The **Beloved of the gods** issues (*these*) commands :― \[2\] More than two years and a half \[3\] (*have elapsed*), since I (*became*) a lay-hearer ; but, indeed, I did not exert myself strenuously. One period of six years,― \[4\] but indeed more than a period of six years, (*has elapsed*), since I have entered \[5\] the community of the ascetics (*and*) have strenuously exerted myself ; but during this time the men who were (*considered*) true in **Jambudvîpa,** (*have been made to appear*) false together with the gods. \[6\] For this is the result of exertion. For, this cannot be attained by a great man alone. But in any case,\[7\] indeed, even a small man, who exerts himself, can gain for himself much heavenly bliss. For this purpose this sermon

......¹ Lines 19 (second half), 20, and 21 (beginning) seem to have contained needless repetitions.  
......² The *ṇa* is in the Northern character.  
......³ As far as this word, the text of the second edict seems to have been in good order. The following five lines exhibit a great confusion. The copyist seems to have repeated the same sentences twice or even three times.  
......⁴ The *ḍe* is somewhat abnormal and looks almost like a mutilated *da*, for which I mistook it when writing the note in the *Vienna Oriental Journal,* Vol. VII. pp. 29 ff. The space between *ye* and *ḍe* looks too small for two letters, and remnants of one only are visible. It seems, therefore, probable that there was no *cha* after *kaṭaviye,* and that the idea of reading the name *Chapaḍa,* mentioned as possible in the *Vienna Oriental Journal,* Vol. VII. p. 32, must be given up.  
......⁵ This is written in Northern or Kharôshṭrî letters. Indistinct remnants of *pi* are visible to the right of *ka*.  
......⁶ The figures within crotchets refer to the remarks given below.
