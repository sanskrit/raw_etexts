****RANGANATHA INSCRIPTION OF SUNDARA-PANDYA.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1148\. An inscription of the Poysaḷa king **Vîra-Nârasiṁhadêva** in the **Raṅganâtha** temple suggests that, subsequently to Śaka-Saṁvat 1194 (the date of No. V.), Râmanâtha was succeeded or supplanted by his half-brother Narasiṁha III. This inscription is dated in the cyclic year *Vijaya*, which would correspond to Śaka-Saṁvat 1216, and refers to **Dêvaladêvî**, who, as stated above, was the mother of Râmanâtha.

......The fact that Râmanâtha held **Śrîraṅgam** after the death of his father, suggests that the defeat which Sundara-Pâṇḍya inflicted on Sômêśvara, had no permanent effect, but that Râmanâtha soon recaptured Śrîraṅgam from the Pâṇḍya king. The subjoined inscription appears to have been engraved between Śaka-Saṁvat 1175, the date of the Bangalore Museum plates of Sômêśvara, and Śaka-Saṁvat 1179, the earliest date of Râmanâtha.

......The immediate purpose of the **Raṅganâtha** inscription of **Sundara-Pâṇḍya** is description of his building operations at, and gifts to, the temple. He built a shrine of **Narasiṁha** (verses 2 and 10) and another of Vishṇu’s attendant **Vishvaksêna** (verse 8), both of which were covered with gold, and a gilt tower which contained an image of **Narasiṁha (7).** Further, he covered the (original or center) shrine of the temple with gold,— an achievement of which he must have been specially proud, as he assumed, with reference to it, the surname **Hêmâchchhâdanarâja**, *i.e.* “the king who has covered (the temple) with gold,” and as he placed in the shrine a golden image of **Vishṇu**, which he called after his own new surname (3). He also covered the inner wall of the (central) shrine with gold (22) and built, in front of it, a dining-hall, which he equipped with golden vessels (23). In the course of two “dining-weeks,” which he called after his own name, he “filled the capacious belly” of the god, or rather of his votaries (26). In the month of Chaitra, he celebrated the “procession-festival” of the god (20). For the “festival of the god’s sporting with Lakshmî,” he built a golden ship (21). The last verse (30) of the inscription states that the king built three golden domes over the image of **Hêmâchchhâdanarâja-Hari** (compare verse 3), over that of **Garuḍa** (compare verse 16), and over the hall which contained the couch of Vishṇu (compare verse 6).

......The following miscellaneous gifts to Raṅganâtha are enumerated in the inscription :— A garland of emeralds (verse 4), a crown of jewels (5), a golden image of **Śêsha** (6), a golden arch (9), a pearl garland (11), a canopy of pearls (12), different kinds of golden fruits (13), a golden car (14), a golden trough (15), a golden image of **Garuḍa** (16), a golden under-garment (17), a golden aureola (18), a golden pedestal (19), ornaments of jewels (24), a golden armour (25), golden vessels (28), and a golden throne (29). The first of the gifts which are here enumerated, appears to have suggested the surname **Marakata-pṛithivîbhṛit,** *i.e.* “the emerald-king,” which is applied to Sundara-Pâṇḍya in verse 13.
