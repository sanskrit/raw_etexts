****KUNIYUR PLATES OF VENKATA II.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Madhurâ** (vv. 49 to 54) ; and IV. the information that the previously mentioned village was **granted by Veṅkaṭa II. at the request of Tirumala** to a number of Brâhmaṇas, and a list of their names, *etc.* (vv. 55-118). The inscription ends with some additional clauses regarding the grant, three verses (124-126) referring to Veṅkaṭa II., the composer and the engraver, five of the usual imprecatory verses, and the name of the god *Śrî-Veṁkaṭêśa.*¹

......The first part of the inscription opens with invocations of the god **Veṅkaṭêśa** (line 1), the feet of Râma (verse 1), and the god Vishvaksêna (verse 2). The genealogy begins with the Moon (verse 3) and some of his mythical descendants (verse 4). The next verse contains a number of royal names which the composer appears to have introduced in order to connect his patron with certain well-known ancient dynasties. Thus **Nanda** is the representative of the dynasty which was subverted by the Mauryas ; **Chaḷikka and Râjanarêndra,** of the Chalukyas ; and **Bijjaḷêndra,** of the Kaḷachuris. **Vîra-Hemmâḷirâya,** the lord of **Mâyâpuri,** is probably identical with the Kaḷachuri king Permâḍi (Śaka-Saṁvat 1050).² The fourth after Hemmâḷi is reported to have been **Tâta-Pinnam** (verse 6), with whom the regular genealogy begins. The only difficult point in this long list of kings is the relation of Raṅga, the father of Veṅkaṭa II., to his predecessors. Dr. Hultzsch has conclusively shown³ that the word *pûrvam,* ‘formerly,’ in verse 24 of the subjoined inscription refers to **Râma II.,** and that Dr. Oppert’s arrangement of the third Vijayanagara dynasty⁴ is opposed to facts. One alteration has to be made in Dr. Hultzsch’s table ;⁵ as recognised by Dr. Oppert,⁶ **Raṅga VI.** was not the son of Gôpâla, but the son of China-or Pina-Veṅkaṭa, and the adopted son of Gôpâla.⁷ In the annexed genealogical table, the Arabic figures prefixed to names show the order in which the latter are mentioned in the copper-plate grants.

......The second of the kings of the accompanying table, **Sômidêva,** is said to have taken seven forts in a single day from an unnamed enemy ( verse 6 ). **Pinnama II.** is styled the “lord of the city of **Âravîṭi”** (verse 7 ). His son, Bukka, is said to have “firmly established even the kingdom of **Sâḷuva-Nṛisiṁha.”** From this statement we may conclude that he was the minister of the third king of the **second vijayanagara dynasty,** Nṛisiṁha or **Narasiṁha,** whose inscrip- tions are dated in Śaka-Saṁvat 1404 and 1418,⁸ and who bore the surname Sâḷuva.⁹ Regarding Bukka’s son, **Râma I.,** we learn from two other grants¹⁰ that he took the fort of Avanigiri from Sapâda or Sapâta, whose army consisted of seventy thousand horse, drove away Kâsappoḍaya or Kâsapuḍaya, and captured the fort of Kandanavôli. Both Muḥammadan historians and European travellers inform us that **Râma II.** was the powerful minister of the puppet king **Sadâśiva,** the last representative of the second Vijayanagara dynasty, whose sister he took in marriage as we learn from an inscription of Sadâśiva.¹¹ Râma II. and his youngest brother **Veṅkaṭâdri** lost their lives in the famous battle of **Tâlikôṭa** on the 23rd January, A.D. 1565. The second brother, **Tirumala I.,** continues to acknowledge the nominal authority of **Sadâśiva** in four inscriptions near Vêlûr in the North Arcot district, which are dated on the 5th February, A.D. 1567.¹² He is said to have transferred the seat of government to **Pennakoṇḍa** in that very
