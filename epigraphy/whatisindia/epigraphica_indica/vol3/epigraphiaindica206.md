experienced at last on approaching thee whose intellect was great, (*and*) the eminence of which was to be worshipped by the best of all scholars. Therefore, how (*can*) we describe (*it*) ?

......(V. 62.) “Having lost the abundance of their great pride, having forgotten the fierceness of their envy, uttering pitiable cries, (*and*) not knowing to which direction to turn,― the elephants, (*viz.*) the opponents in disputations, ah ! run away trembling at the (*very*) smell of the mast elephant, (*viz.*) the holy scholar **Padmanâbha.”¹**

......(V. 63.) Let him protect (*us*), **Kumârasêna,** who possessed **Jaina** penance which removes pain, from whom ascetics (*received*) both initiation and instruction, (*and*) whose pure life (*was*) an example of the path to bliss !

......(V. 64.) Let him have mercy on me, the preceptor **Mallishêṇa-Maladhâridêva,** the lion who split in two the *mast* elephant, blind with fury (*viz.*) Cupid, the destroyer of the dignity of people ; by whose feet crest of kings were to be adorned ; (*and*) whose practice of the austerities which consist of twice six (*i.e.* twelve) kinds,² (*was as brilliant*) as the rising of the sun !³

......(V. 65.) I worship that lord of sages, **Maladhârin,** whose heart was firmly resolved to be engaged in beating the enemy, delusion, (*and*) who was exceedingly resplendent with true self-restraint. Even the dirt which had collected on his body, (*was*) alone able to wash off the soot of the ugly impurity, which had gathered in the minds of those who bowed (*before him*) in the manner of manifest devotion.⁴

......(V. 66.) Let him sport in the dwelling of my mind, the king of sages, **Mallishêṇa,** whose lotus-feet attracted a crowd of good men, (*as*) a bevy of bees, (*and who was*) the abode of the splendour of the power of great penance, which resembled a fire for burning the ancient forest of mundane existence, filled with a mass of deep darkness !

......(V. 67.) Worthy to be worshipped is that Rôhaṇa mountain of gem-like virtues,⁵ the holy preceptor **Mallishêṇa,** whose body was covered with dirt in order to remove the impurity (*of sin*), who was poor in order (*to obtain*) the glory of the kingdom of all the three worlds, (*who practised*) penance which surpassed fire (*in heat*), in order to remove the great pain (*of human life*), (*and*) who purified the earth by (*his*) wonderfully beautiful conduct.

......(V. 68.) How should he not (*create*) wonder on account of (*his*) conduct, the holy sage **Mallishêṇa,** in whom unequalled forbearance delights, whom mercy violently embraces, whom impartiality loves, whom freedom from covetousness covets, (*and*) who, though himself a lover of final emancipation, yet (*is*) the foremost of ascetics ?⁶

......(V. 69.) Obeisance to that holy lord of ascetics, **Maladhârin,** who is worthy to be worshipped on earth, whom the good incessantly praise with eagerness, by whom Cupid’s bow was conquered, to whom sages pay homage, from whom ascetics (*obtain*) decisions (*on doubtful points*) in the **Âgamas,** who has mercy on living beings, (*and*) in whom resides the religion (*dharma*) !

......(V. 70.) At the *tîrtha* of **Dhavalasarasa,** he, striving at ripeness which was blessed by renunciation, full of joy, with firm, (*and*) exercising (*his body*) in the (*five*) methods (of

......¹ This verse illustrates Padmanâbha’s surname Vâdikôlâhala, *i.e.* ‘the tumult of disputants.’  
......² \[The twice six kinds of austerities are the six external (*bâhira-tapas*) and the six internal (*abhyantara- tapas*). Regarding their names and the whole classification of *tapas,* see the *Aupapâtikasûtra,* paragraph 30.― E. L.\]  
......³ In comparing the twelve kinds of austerities to the sun, the author alludes to one of the names of the latter, *viz.* Dvâdaśâtman.  
......⁴ This sentiment is suggested by the name of Maladhârin, which means ‘the bearer of dirt.’  
......⁵ The Rôhaṇa mountain (Adam’s Peak) is celebrated for its mines of precious stones.
