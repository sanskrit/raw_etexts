......While the lord of princes **Vîra-Chôḷa** was ruling the whole earth, a Brâhmaṇ named **Nîla** was his spiritual adviser.

**No. 15.― GANAPESVARAM INSCRIPTION OF THE TIME OF GANAPATI.  
  
SAKA-SAMVAT 1153.  
  
BY E. HULTZSCH, PH.D.**

......This inscription has been already drawn attention to by Mr. G. Mackenzie in his *Manual of the Kistna District,* p. 214, and by Mr. R. Sewell in his *Lists of Antiquities,* Vol. I. p. 54. It is engraved on three faces of a stone pillar in front of the Durgâmbâ temple at **Gaṇapêśvaram,** a hamlet near Talagaḍa-Dêvi in the Bandar (Masulipatam) Tâlukâ of the Kistna district. The same pillar bears four other, later inscriptions, *viz*. one at the bottom of the east face¹ underneath the inscription of Gaṇapati, and three others² on the north face, which had been left blank by the engraver of the Gaṇapati inscription.

......The **alphabet** of the inscription is Telugu. The language is **Sanskṛit** verse as far as line 121, and **Telugu** prose from line 121 to the end. The Sanskṛit portion opens with invocations of Vishṇu, Śiva, and Gaṇêśa (verses 1 to 3). Verses 4 to 14 contain a short genealogy of the **Kâkatîya** king **Gaṇapati,** to whose time the inscription belongs.

He defeated
