**TRANSLATION.**

......(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! In the nineteenth year (*of the reign*) of **Kannaradêva, the conqueror of Kachchi and Tañjai.**

......(L. 3.) “Whereas **Śâttan Śennippêraiyan** of **Karai** had built a hall (*ambalam*) to the south of the holy **Mûlasthâna** (*temple*) at **Tirukkalukkunram in Kaḷattûr-kôṭṭam** (*and*) in the subdivision called after itself, and had given as a dependence (? *puram*) of this hall, *viz.* for providing water and for supplying fire to the hall,¹⁰ a well and (*one*) *paṭṭi* of land (*called*) *Kaḷarichcheruvu*,¹¹ which he had purchased from **Iśânaśiva** *alias* **Nakkaḍi-Bhaṭṭa,─** (*we*), the members of the assembly (*sabhâ*), having taken from this (*person*) the money for taxes, gave (*the land*) tax-free for as long as our village,¹² the moon and the sun endure.â€?

extreme south of the peninsula has been explained by supposing that the river was swallowed up by the son. In his *History of Tinnevelly,* p. 19 ff., Dr. Caldwell has shown, from explicit statements contained in the *Periplûs*, that Kumari was not a river but a place, and that people did, in ancient times as now, not bathe in a river but in the sea. Dr. Caldwell adds that the title *Kumarichchêrppan,* which is given to the Pâṇḍya king on account of the proximity of his dominions to Cape Comorin, also implies that Kumari was not a river but a tract of land.  
......¹ In the original the symbols for *e* and *t* of to are joined together.  
......² The symbol for *ê* and *k* of *kô* are joined together in the original.  
......³ In the original it looks as if there were three *r*’s here instead of two, of which the first is joined to the *kû* which precedes it.  
......⁴ Read *Mûlasthânattu.*  
......⁵ Read *ºpêraiyan* ; it is not impossible that the emgraver has himself made this correction.  
......⁶ Over the *ku* of *ºkumm=âga* some symbol which looks like the modern Tamil *nâ* is cut, and between *ºkumm=âga* of this line and *sabhai* of the next, the modern Tamil numeral ‘nineteen’ appears to be engraved ......⁷ Over the *ṭi* of *paṭṭi* and the *ai* of *vaiytta,* the modern Tamil symbol for the numeral ‘ten’ engraved.  
......⁸ Above the *l* of *pakkal* the modern Tamil numeral ‘eight’ is engraved.  
......⁹ Over the *aksharas śeyda pâº* the modern Tamil numeral ‘seventy-seven’ is engraved.  
......¹⁰ In the Kûram plates, provision is made for water and fire required for a *maṇḍapa* at Kûram ; see *South- Indian Inscriptions,* Vol. I. p. 151.  
......¹¹ The word *kaḷari* means ‘uncultivated ground’ and *śeruvu* means ‘a field’. *Kaḷarichcheruvs* was probably a proper name, denoting a certain tract of rice-fields.  
......¹² It is not common in inscriptions to make the duration of a grant co-extensive with that of the village in which the object granted lies.
