**.No. 35.─ DUDIA PLATES OF PRAVARASENA II.  
  
BY F. KIELHORN, PH.D., LL.D., C.I.E. ; GÖTTINGEN.**

......These plates were sent to Dr. Hultzsch by Mr. H. Cousens, Superintendent of the Archæological Survey of Western India, who had received them from Mr. W. Montgomerie, Settlement Officer, Chhindwara, Central Provinces. They belong to “Bharatsa and others, Gonds, at **Dudia** in the Aser parganâ of the Chhindwara district,” I edit the inscription which they contain from excellent impressions, supplied by Mr. Cousens and Dr. Hultzsch.

......These are **four well preserved copper-plates,** each of which measures 7½’’ long by 3⅝’’ broad. The second and third plates are inscribed on both sides, the first plate is so on one side only, and the fourth is blank and merely serves to protect the writing on the second side of the third plate. The plates are quite smooth, their edges having been neither fashioned thicker nor raised into rims ; but the writing, nevertheless, is in an excellent state of preservation throughout. About 1¼” distant from the middle of the proper right margin, each plate has a hole, about 7/16” in diameter, for a ring on which the plates were strung. This **ring** is between ¼ and ⅜” thick, and 3⅞” in diameter. The two ends of the piece of copper of which it is formed are flattened off, and contains holes for a rivet, which has been lost. On the ring slides a copper band, ¾’’ broad, which is bent into a ring of ⅞ by 1⅛” in diameter, and two ends of which are soldered together. Through the soldered part a hole is drilled, which corresponds to a hole in the centre of a circular seal ; and a rivet, which also is lost now, must have held the copper band and the seal together.² Owing to the loss of the two rivets,─ the ring , the copper band and the seal are now quite loose. The seal is 3 1/16’’ in diameter, and has across its surface a **legend** in four lines, which will be given below.─ The **weight** of the four plates is 3 ¼ lbs.,

......² Compare Dr. Fleet’s description of the Siwanî plates ; *Gupta Inscriptions,* p. 244.
