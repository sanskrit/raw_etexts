......(V. 26.) Having arranged two dining-weeks (*abhyavahâra-vâra*),¹ (*which he called*) after his own name, (*and*) the abundance of which was inexhaustible, **Sundara-Pâṇḍya**, who entertained the desire for pre-eminence, filled the capacious belly of Śârṅgin, who is the lord of **Raṅga**, which even the fourteen worlds had been unable to fill.

......(V. 27.) Repeatedly performing the ascending of the scales² on every day at the shrine of the lord of **Raṅga**, the Sun among kings would have doubtlessly broken up (*Mount*) Mêru for the sake of (*its*) gold, if (*that mountain*) had not borne the fish which was the device on his (*the king’s*) banner.³

......(V. 28.) The Sun among kings gave to Śârṅgin, who reclines on the sandy bank of the daughter of the **Kavêra** mountain, huge vessels, wrought of gold, which appeared to be so many suns of majesty, taken from the crowd of rival kings by the power of (*his*) arm.

......(V. 29.) Placed along with Lakshmî on the throne (*siṁhâsana*), which the Sun among kings made out of the conquered thrones, from which he had thrown by force all kings who would not bow (*to him*), and gave to the lord of **Raṅga**, (*and*) which is as lofty as his own mind,— that (*god*) resembles a cloud, accompanied by lighting (*and*) resting on the slope of (*Mount*) Mêru.⁴

......(V. 30.) For Hari, who had received the famous name of **Hêmâchchhâdanarâja** \[*i.e.* of the king who has covered (*the temple*) with gold\], for the golden destroyer of snakes (*i.e.* **Garuḍa**), and for the splendid hall (*which contained*) the couch (*of the god*),— the Sun among kings built three golden domes (*vimâna*), by which (*the temple of*) **Śrîraṅga** glitters as he (*the king*) by the (*three*) crowns⁵ worn at (*his*) coronation.

**No. 3.â€” ALAMANDA PLATES OF ANANTAVARMAN.  
  
BY E. HULTZSCH. PH.D.**

......This inscription is engraved on three copper-plates of about 7⅛ by 3 inches, which were “found underground while excavating a site near **Alamanda** in the Śṛiṅgavarapukôṭa tâlukâ of the Vizagapatam district,” and kindly transmitted to me by the Collector, Mr. W. A. Willock, I.C.S. The Plates are strung on a plain ring, which had been cut before I received them, and which measures about ⅜ inch in thickness, and 4½ inches in diameter. The rims of each plates is about 1 lb 7 oz., and that of the ring about 9 oz., total about 2 lb. The rims of each side of the plates are slightly raised in order to protect the writing, which is in nearly perfect preservation. The alphabet closely resembles that of a copper-plate grant of **Dêvêndravarman**, the son of the *Mahârâja* Anantavarman, which was published with a facsimile by Dr. Fleet.⁶ The language is very incorrect Sanskṛit, and is prose throughout, with the exception of two imprecatory verses (lines 24-27).

......¹ I have translated *vâra* by ‘week,’ a meaning which it has in Tamil and Kanarese, as two *weeks* (*i.e.* fourteen *days*) would better correspond to the fourteen worlds which are referred to in the second half of the verse, than two days. In Sanskṛit *vâra* means only ‘a week-day.’  
......² See p. 14 above, note 9.  
......³ In the panegyrical introduction of the Tamil inscriptions of the Pâṇḍya kings, it is stated that their banner, the two fishes, fluttered (*i.e.* had been planted as a memento of conquest) on Mount Mêru. See, *e.g.,* line 4 f. of the Tirupparaṅkunram cave-inscription of Mâravarman, *alias* Sundara-Pâṇḍyadêva (*Ind. Ant.* Vol. XXI. p. 344) :— *Por-kiri mêl vari-kkayalgaḷ viḷaiyâḍa*, “while the spotted carps were sporting on the Golden Mountain.”  
......⁴ Vishṇu, whose body is of dark colour, corresponds to the cloud, Lakshmî to the lightening, and the throne to the golden mountain Mêru. Compare verses 9 and 19.  
......⁵ This refers to the crowns of the Pâṇḍya, Chôḷa and Chêra kingdoms. Compare Mummuḍi-Chôḷadêva, the Chôḷa king (who wears) three crowns,’ which was a surname of the great Râjarâja ; *South-Indian Inscriptions,* Vol. II. p. 139, note 1, and p. 222, note 4.  
......⁶ *Ind. Ant.* Vol. XVIII. pp. 143 ff.
