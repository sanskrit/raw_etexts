......(L. 13.) “The feet of one who protects this charity, shall be on (*our*) heads. One who injures this charity, shall incur the sin committed by those who commit seven hundred **murders near the Gaṅgâ and near Kumari.â€?**

**No. 39.─ NADUPURU GRANT OF ANNA-VEMA ;  
  
SAKA-SAMVAT 1296.  
  
BY E. HULTZSCH, PH.D.**

......The original of this inscription belonged to the late Sir Walter Elliot. I edit it from two sets of impressions, prepared for Sir Walter Elliot, and kindly made over to me by Dr. Fleet, who was noted the following details on the cover containing the impressions :— “Three copper plates, 10⅜ by 4⅜ inches ; in fair order if cleaned. The edges are slightly raised into rims. The ring *has* been cut ; it is about ⅝” thick and 4¼” in diameter, and has a kneeling bull soldered on to it. The plates are marked ‘21’ in white paint ; but there is no label to say where they come from.” The second sides of the three plates are numbered with the Telugu numerals 1, 2, 3, respectively, between the ring-hole and the edge.

......The **alphabet** is Telugu. Of **orthographical** peculiarities the following deserve to be noted. The letter *bh* is not distinguished from *b* if the vowels *â, ô, au* and *i* are attached to it or if it forms the second consonant of a group (as in ![](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/epigraphica_indica/vol3/images/229.bmp), line 11, and ![](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/epigraphica_indica/vol3/images/230.bmp):, l. 54), and if, consequently, the right top-stroke which distinguishes *bh* from *b,* disappears ; only in two cases (*bhi* of ![](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/epigraphica_indica/vol3/images/231.bmp), l. 2, and ![](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/epigraphica_indica/vol3/images/232.bmp), l. 3), the aspiration is then denoted by a vertical line below the letter. In the *aksharas rya* (ll. 33 to 39) and *rṛi* (l. 44), the letter *r* is written in full, and the secondary forms of *ya* and *ṛi* are attached to it. The group *tth* is throughout written as *tht,* and similarly the group *ddha* of ![](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/epigraphica_indica/vol3/images/233.bmp) (l. 24) is represented by *dhta.*

......The languages of the inscription are **Sanskṛit** and **Telugu.** It opens with nineteen Sanskṛit verses, which are followed by a list of the twenty donees in Sanskṛit prose (l. 32 ff.). The boundaries of the granted village are specified in Telugu prose (l. 39 ff.). Then follow five imprecatory verses in Sanskṛit (l. 47 ff.), and the inscription ends with a short sentence in Telugu (l. 55 f.).

......As the Vanapalli plates of Śaka-Saṁvat 1300 (No. 10 above), the present inscription records a grants of land by **Anna-Vêma of Koṇḍavîṭi** (verse 15), *i.e.* of Koṇḍavîḍu in the Kistna district. It opens with a genealogy which contains the same proper names as that of the other inscription. After an invocation of the Boar-incarnation of **Vishṇu** (v. 1), it refers to the **(Śûdra) caste** (v. 2), a member of which was **Prôla** (v. 3), whose son **Vêma** (v. 4) built a flight of step at **Śrîśaila** (v. 6). Vêma’s two sons, **Anna-Vôta** and **Anna-Vêma** (v. 7), successively occupied the throne after him (vv. 8 and 10). **Anna-Vêma** or **Anna-Vêma** (l. 55) bore the surnames **Vasantarâya** (v. 13) and **Pallava-Trinêtra** (v. 15). The first of these two epithets, which means ‘the king of spring,’ he owed to his participation in the spring festival (*vasantôtsava*, v. 14).¹ The surname Pallava-Trinêtra is borrowed from a mythical king of the Telugu country, who appears as Trilôchana-Pallava in the inscriptions of the Eastern Chalukya dynasty,² as Triṇayana-Pallava in the Yenamadala inscription of Gaṇapâmbâ (p. 95 above), and as Mukkaṇṭi-Pallava or Mukkaṇṭirâja in local legends.³ As in the Vanapalli
