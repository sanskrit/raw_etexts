......This inscription, which I edit from impressions supplied to me by Dr. Fleet, is at the temple of Sârajâdêvî¹⁶ at the village of **Bahâḷ,** in the Châlîsgaon subdivision of the Khândêś district of the Bombay Presidency (*Indian Atlas,* sheet 38, long. 75° p’ E., lat. 20° 36’N.). It contains nineteen lines of writing, which cover a space of about 2’ 10’’ broad by 1’ 3½’’ high, and is almost throughout in a perfect state of preservation. The average **size of the letters** is slightly less than ½’’. The **characters** are Nâgarî. The **language** is Sanskṛit ; and, excepting the introductory *ôṁ* \|\| *ôṁ namô Dvârajâ-dêvyai* and the words *atha raja-vaṁśaḥ* in line 7, lines 1-18 are in verse. The verses are numbered, and their total number is twenty. In respect of **orthography** I have only to state that the letter *b* is exceptionally denoted by the sign for *v* in the words *vivudha,* in line 3, and *vrahma*, in line 7.

......¹ Read *iti* \|\| *Uktaṁ.*  
......² Metre : Ślôka (Anushṭubh); and of the next three verses.  
......³ Read *vasêt*.  
......⁴ This line commences under the third *akshara* of the preceding line; and in the vacant space at the beginning of the line one would have expected *dânaṁ* or *dâyaṁ.*  
......⁵ Read *bhuktâ*.  
......⁶ Read *bhûmis=tasya*. At the commencement of the there is again a vacant space, where one would have expected *phalaṁ* \|\|.  
......⁷ Read *narâdhipa*.  
......⁸ Read *mahîbṛitâṁ*.  
......⁹ Metre : Pushpitâgrâ. Read *iti kamala-.*  
......¹⁰ At the beginning of this line is again a vacant space, sufficient for the missing *aksharas –dal-âmbu-vîṁ-.*  
......¹¹ Read *purushaiḥ para-kî-.*  
......¹² Here, too, is a vacant space at the beginning of the line, where we miss the *aksharas rttayô vi-.*  
......¹³ This is what is, or seems to be, actually engraved. The *śî* or *śît* at the beginning may be meant for *śrî* or *śrîmat-*; but the name of the *dûtaka* I am unable to make out.  
......¹⁴ Here, again, I am unable to guess what name may be intended, and can only say that the two last *aksharas* probably are meant to be *-n=êti.*  
......¹⁵ Below the *aksharas* of line 73, beginning with the *dû* of *dûtakaṁ* and ending with the *śva* of *paramêśvar-.* about ten or eleven more *aksharas* are engraved, close to the lower edge of the plate ; but they are too indistinct to be made out. It is just possible that they are the eleven *aksharas* which for some reason or other are omitted at the beginning of lines 70-73.  
......¹⁶ According to information furnished to me with the impressions, this is the name now current ; but the original name must have been *Dvârajâ*, an appellation of Bhavânî which I have not met with before.
