**A.— INSCRIPTION OF RAJAKESARIVARMAN.**

......This inscription is dated in the 27th year of the reign of **Râjakêsarivarman,** and records the renewal of a grant which had been made by a king called **Skandaśishya** and confirmed by another king, **Vâtâpi koṇḍa Naraśiṁgappôttaraiyar.** Skandaśishya is probably synonymous with **Skandavarman,** a name which occurs repeatedly in the genealogy of an early branch of the **Pallavas,¹** whose grants are dated from Palakkada, Daśanapura and Kâñchîpura.² Though we have no materials for identifying this king, yet it is certain that he was one of the predecessors of the other Pallava king who is mentioned in the inscription. This is Naraśiṁgappôttaraiyar,³ which is a Tamil form of the Sanskṛit name of the Pallava king Narasiṁhavarman. The epithet Vâtâpi koṇḍa, **‘who took Vâtâpi,’** which is given to the king, enables us to identify him with certainty with the Pallava king **Narasiṁhavarman I.** who is described both in the Kûram plates of Paramêśvaravarman I.⁴ and in the Udayêndiram plates of Nandivarman Pallavamalla⁵ as the destroyer of **Vâtâpi** and as the enemy of **Pulikêśin (II.)** *alias* Vallabharâja. The Singhalese chronicle *Mahâvaṁsa* also refers to this war between Narasiṁha and Vallabha, in which **Mâṇavamma,** one of the claimants to the kingdom of Ceylon, who was then residing in India, rendered substantial service to the Pallava king.⁶ The *Periyapurâṇam,* a Tamil work which narrates the lives of the sixty-three devotees of Śiva, and some of the statements made in which have been confirmed by recent epigraphical discoveries,⁷ refers to the destruction of Vâtâpi in the account of the life of one of the devotees, *viz.* **Śiruttiṇḍa-Nâyanâr.** It is reported that this devotee, who was originally a military man, “reduced to dust the old city of **Vâtâpi”⁸** for his master, whose name is not given, but who must undoubtedly have been the Pallava king Narasiṁhavarman I. who destroyed Vâtâpi according to the Pallava inscriptions.

......According to the *Periyapurâṇam,* **Śiruttoṇḍa-Nâyanâr** was visited at his own village by the great Śaiva devotee **Tiruñânasambandar,⁹** and the latter mentions Śiruttoṇḍa by name in one of his hymns.¹⁰ Thus Tiruñânasambandar was a contemporary of a general of the Pallava king Narasiṁhavarman I., whose enemy was the Western Chalukyya king Pulikêśin II.
