****BAMANI INSCRIPTION OF VIJAYADITYA.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**No. 28.─ BAMANI INSCRIPTION OF THE SILAHARA VIJAYADITYA ;  
  
SAKA-SAMVAT 1073.  
  
BY F. KIELHORN, PH.D., C.I.E. ; GÖTTINGEN.**

......This inscription is on a stone which stands by the door of a Jaina temple at the village of **Bâmaṇî,** five miles south-west of Kâgal, the chief town of the Kâgal State in the Kôlhâpur Territory. An account of its contents and a kind of transcript of the text are given in Major Graham’s *Statistical Report of the Principality of Kolhapoor,* p. 381. I edit it now from a good impression, supplied to me by Dr. Fleet.

......The inscription contains 44 lines of writing which covers a space of about 2’ 10½” high by 1’ 4” broad. At the end of each of the lines 1-3 and 13 one *akshara,* which in each case can be easily supplied, is effaced, and one or two *aksharas,* which cannot be restored, are broken away at the end each of the lines 14 and 15 ; otherwise the writing is well preserved. At the top of the stone are some sculptures : immediately above the writing, in the centre, a seated Jaina figure, facing full front, cross-legged, with the hands joined in the lap, and surmounted by a serpent coiled up behind and displaying seven hoods ; to the proper left of this figure, a crooked sword or dagger and a cow with a calf ; and above these, again, on the right the sun, and on the left the moon.― The average **size of the letters** is about ⅜”.― The **characters** are Old-Kanarese.― The **language** is Sanskṛit, excepting part of line 43 and line 44 which are in Old-Kanarese. The main part of the text is in prose, but nine verses occur in lines 1-2, 26-31, and 34-43. As regards **orthography,** the sign of the *upadhmânîya* (which is like the sign for *r*) has been employed before the word *Purudêvasya* in l. 1, and before *patyâ* in l. 16 and *pitrâ* in l. 17 ; and instead of the word conjunct *ddh* we find *dhdh* in the words *sidhdhi* in l. 10 and *udhdhâra* in l. 19.

......This inscription records another grant of land by the *Mahâmaṇḍalêśvara* **Vijayâdityadêva** of the **Śiḷâhâra** family. Opening with a verse glorifying the Jaina faith, which is already known to us from lines 2-3 of the preceding inscription, it gives in lines 2-10 the genealogy and description of the donor as they are given by that other inscription, only omitting the names of six of his more distant relatives (Kîrtirâja, Chandrâditya, Gûvala II., Gaṅgadêva, Ballâḷadêva and Bhôjadêva) and nine of his less important *birudas*.¹ Lines 11-34 then record that **Vijayâdityadêva,** ruling at his residence of **Vaḷavâḍa,** at the request of his maternal uncle, the *Sâmanta* Lakshmaṇa, and for the spiritual benefit of his family,² ― **on the occasion of a lunar eclipse on Friday, the full-moon tithi of the month Bhâdrapada of the Pramôda year, when 1073 Saka years had elapsed,─** granted a field which by the measure of the **Kûṇḍi** country measured one quarter of a *nivartana,* a flower-garden measuring 30 *stambhas,* and a dwelling-house measuring 12 *hastas,* all belonging to the village of **Maḍa\[l\]ûra** in the district of . . **navu\[ka\]gegoḷḷa,** for the eightfold worship\[ of Pârśvanâthadêva at a shrine which had been established at the village by Chôdhore-Kâmagâvuṇḍa³ (the son of Saṇagamayya and Chaṁ\[dha\]- . . vvâ, husband of Punnakabbâ, and father of Jentagâvuṇḍa and Hemmagâvuṇḍa), and for the purposes of keeping the shrine in proper repair and of providing food for the ascetics of the shrine,― having washed the feet of Arhanandisiddhântadêva (probably the superintendent of the shrine), a disciple of Mâghanandisiddhântadêva who, in addition to what is stated of him in the preceding inscription, is described here as a pupil of Kulachadramuni and as ‘a sun of the

......¹ The *biruda* which in the preceding inscription is spelt *maruvaṁka-sarppaḥ,* is here in l. 7 spelt *maruvakka-sarppaḥ.  * ......² Literally (in l. 24) ‘in order that it might be a gift of his family.’  
......³ The first part of this name is not clear to me. In l. 16 of a fragmentary inscription at Kôlhâpur of Śaka- Saṁvat 1161 I find the name *Chaudhurî-Kâmagâumda.* \[*Gâvuṇḍa* is the same as the Kanarese *gauḍa,* ‘the headman of a village.’― E. H.\]
