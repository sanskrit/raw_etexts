****VANAPALLI PLATES OF ANNA-VEMA.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

......(V. 15.) On the blade of his Sword glitter extremely bright images, which appear to be the annexed lines of fortune¹ of kings who have refused to submit (*to him*).

......(V. 16.) This noble king **Anna-Vêma,** who is exclusively addicted to liberality and bravery, has made the earth up to the four points of the horizon free from the crowd of enemies (*apa-ari-jâta*), but at the same time endowed with the Pârijâta.²

......(V. 17.) The sword of **Anna-Vêma** bears resemblance to the regents of the points of the horizon, as it is victorious, bright, black, carnivorous, fettering, destructive, liberal, (*and*) terrible.³

......(V. 18.) While king **Anna-Vêma,** the treasury of all virtues, whose great fortune is praised (*as he employs it*) for the protection of the world, is seated in the *darbâr* on the jewelled throne, some people receive the sovereignty over a country (*dêśa*), others the distinction of a palanquin, a *chaurî,* and a parasol, others their (*confiscated*) kingdom, (*and*) others *agrahâras*, full of wealth.⁴

......(V. 19.) Victorious is king **Ana-Vêma,** (*who is also called*) **Kshurikâ-Kali-Vêtâla,⁵** who bears the surname (*biruda*) **Karpûra-Vasantarâya,⁶** whose gifts of land are boundless, (*and*) who is a treasury of wealth.

......(V. 20.) The wealth of the lord **Anna-Vêma** exists (*only*) for the enrichment of learned men, and their eloquence for his glorification.

......(V. 21.) In the **Śâka** year reckoned by the atmosphere (0), the sky (0), and the Viśvas (13), (*i.e.* **1300**), in the (*cyclic*) year **Siddhârthin,** in (*the month of*) Mâgha, on the fourteenth *tithi*, (*which is sacred to*) Śiva, of the dark (*fortnight*), this heroic lord **Anna-Vêma** granted the incomparable village of **Immaḍilaṅka,** the best of *agrahâras*, which he had founded, to the illustrious scholar **Immaḍîndra,** a descendant of the **Lôhita** *gôtra*.

......(V. 22.) **Immaḍîśvara** (*is*) to kings the lord of ministers in politics, the chief of learned men in scientific discussions, (*and*) a friend in salutary counsels.

......(V. 23.) This **Immaḍîndra,** who had studied all subjects, who was superior in honours, (*and who was*) the son of **Mallaya-Mantrin,** having received the *agrahâra*, gave, with joyful heart, one half of it to (*other*) Brâhmaṇas.

......(V. 24.) Resplendent is the sinless **Immaḍilaṅka**, (*alias*) **Anna-Vêmapura,** which is honoured (*through bearing the names of*) a hero (*and*) a preceptor,⁷ which is surrounded by the current of the daughter of Gautama (*i.e.* the **Gautamî** river), (*and*) which is adorned with plentiful corn.

......(Line 49.) The boundaries (*of this village*) are determined as follows :―

......(V. 25 f.) In the east, (*a row of*) *pîpal* trees on the west of **Kriddêvî ;** in the southern direction, a straight line (?) between a *pîpal* tree on a platform (?) in the village of **Prakhyâ** and the house of **Mugguḷḷasanda ;** in the western direction, the **Gautamî** (*river*) ; and in the north, the interval between the banyan-trees at **Koṇḍûrî** and **Koṇḍepûṇḍî.**

......(V. 27.) The boundaries of the village of **Immaḍilaṅka** are (*thus*) declared.

........(Line 53.) Now quotations from the **Purâṇas** are written :―

......................................\[Three of the customary verses.\]

......¹ The expression *bhâgya-rêkhâ* is probably borrowed from palmistry.  
......² *i.e.* he was as liberal as the Pârijâta tree, which here takes the place of the Kalpa tree.  
......³ These eight adjectives are, at the same time, surnames of the eight regents of the points of the horizon.  
......⁴ This verse is intended for an account of the daily transactions in the king’s court.  
......⁵ *i.e.* “(he who resembles) a Vȇtâla in battle with (his) dagger.”  
......⁶ This epithet suggests that the king used to take part in the celebration of spring-festival (*hôlî*), at which camphor and other substances are scattered about. Compare *Ep. Ind.* vol. I. p. 370, note 64.  
......⁷ *i.e.* of king Anna-Vêma and of his preceptor Immaḍi.
