****VANAPALLI PLATES OF ANNA-VEMA.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

(vv. 13, 16, 17, 18, 20 and 21), **Ana-Vêma** (vv. 19 and 28) or (in Telugu) **Ana-Vêma** (l. 65). The second of these resided at **Koṇḍavîṭî** (v. 14), *i.e.* Koṇḍavîḍu, and bore the surnames **Jaganobbagaṇḍa** (v. 13), **Kshurikâ-Kali-Vêtâla** and **Karpûra-Vasantarâya** (v. 19). Two references to **Hêmâdri** (vv. 9 and 11) show that his *Dânakhaṇḍa* was considered an authority at the time of the grant.

......The immediate object of the inscription is to record that king **Anna-Vêma** granted a village as an *agrahâra* to a certain **Immaḍi** of the **Lôhita** *gôtra* (v. 21), who was the son of the minister **Mallaya** (v. 23) and appears to have been the minister (v. 22) and spiritual preceptor (v. 24) of the king. The date of the grant was the **fourteenth** *tithi* of the **dark** fortnight of **Mâgha** in the cyclic year **Siddhârthin** and the **Śaka** year **1300** (v. 21). The Siddhârthi-*saṁvatsara* does not correspond with Śaka-Saṁvat 1300, but with 1301 expired or 1302 current (A.D. 1379-80). Mr. Dikshit kindly informs me that the European equivalent of the date is **Monday, the 6th February, A.D. 1380.** The granted village was named **Immaḍilaṅka** (vv. 21, 24, 27 and 28) after the donee, and also **Anna-Vêmapura** (v. 24) after the donor. The western boundary of the granted village was the **Gautamî** (v. 26), which may mean either the Gôdâvarî river in general, or its northern branch below the present Anicut. Mr. Gopalam, the discover of the inscription, remarks that **Vanapalli,** where the plates were found, “lies on the southern side of the Gautamî, a branch of the Gôdâvarî, and there is a hamlet called **Immaḍivârilaṅka** to the north of the village.” The southern boundary of Immaḍilaṅka is stated to have been “a straight line (?) between a *pîpal* tree on a platform (?) in the village of **Prakhyâ** and the house of **Mugguḷḷasanda**” (v. 25 f.). Mr. Gopalam says :― “There are two villages, called **Prakkilaṅka** and **Mugguḷḷa,** above the Anicut, and I entertain some doubt whether the inscription under enquiry relates to any grant near those villages.” If this is really the case, the granted village of Immaḍilaṅka cannot be identical with the modern Immaḍivârilaṅka, which is not above, but below the Anicut. I am unable to say which of these two possibilities is correct, nor have I any means for identifying the boundaries in the east (Kriddêvî, v. 25) and in the north (Koṇḍûrî and Koṇḍepûṇḍî, v. 26).

......After the usual imprecatory verses follow two verses in which the composer of the inscription, **Trilôchanârya,** praises his own poetical merits (v. 28 f.). The document ends with an invocation of Śiva and with the signature of the king.
