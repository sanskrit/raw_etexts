......These plates were found bu Mr. M. Aiyâsvâmi Aiyar, Inspecting Schoolmaster of the Chingleput tâlukâ, in the possession of the Munsif of the village of **Ûnamâñjêri,** four miles east of the Vaṇḍalûr Railway Station. At Dr. Hultzsch’s request, they were lent to him by the Tahsildar of Chingleput ; and I now edit the inscription from two excellent impression, supplied to me by Dr. Hultzsch.

......These are **five copper-plates,** the first and last of which have been engraved on the inner side only, while the others are so on both faces. They are numbered, on the first inscribed side of each plate, with the Telugu-Kanarese numerals from 1 to 5, as may be seen from the accompanying photo-lithograph. Each plate is between 7 5/16” and 7¾” broad, and, including the arch at the top, about 10⅜” high ; and the writing runs across the breadth of the plates. The plates are held together by **a ring,** which had been cut before they were received by Dr. Hultzsch. It is about 3⅛” in diameter and ⅜” thick, and holds **a seal,** the lower part of which consists of a smaller ring, through which the larger ring is passed. This seal is 1⅜” in diameter. It bears, on a plain pedestal, the figure of a boar, which faces the proper right and is surmounted by a sword or dagger and by the moon and the sun. On the proper left side of the back of the fourth plate the writing has suffered slightly from corrosion ; otherwise the plates are in a perfect state of preservation. The writer and engraver have done their work fairy well ; but they have omitted ten *aksharas* (whih we can supply from other inscriptions) at the end of line 23, and sixteen others (which we cannot supply) in lines 149-150, not to mention minor errors.— The **characters** are Nandinâgarî, excepting the word *śrî-Virupâksha* in line 199, which is in large Kanarese characters. The inscription offers the rare sign for *jh*, in the word *pîtôjhitas* (for *pîtôjjhitas*) in line 77 ; and it has a sign for the rough *r,* which is like the ordinary sign for *r* combined with the superscript sign for the same letter, in the words *mûru*, l. 82, *Śeṁkaḷanîrpaṭṭu*, l. 99, and *Uruvâr*, l. 148. **The average size of the letters** is about 3/16’’.— The **language** is Sanskṛit, and, excepting the words *śrî-Gaṇâdhipatayê ṅamaḥ* at the commencement of line 1, the whole is in verse.
