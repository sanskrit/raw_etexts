**TRANSLATION.**

......(Line 1.) Let there be prosperity ! Hail ! Fortune ! At the auspicious time of **Mahâmagam** (Mahâmâgha),⁵ (*when*) Jupiter (*was standing in*) Leo, (*i.e.*) on the day of (*the nakshatra*) Magam (Maghâ), which corresponded to a Sunday and to the full-moon *tithi* of the first fortnight of the month of Kumbha of the **Plava** *saṁvatsara*, which was current after **the Śaka year 1403,―** the glorious *mahâmaṇḍalêśvara*, a Bhîma among the **Chôḷas,** a Nârâyaṇa among the **Chôḷas,** the lord of **Uraiyûr** the best of cities, **Vâlaka-Kâmaya,** *alias* **Akkalarâja,** gave **Âdi-Chaṇḍêśvara⁶** (*in*) the temple of the beautiful lord of **Tiruvânaikkâ :―**

......(L. 3.) “(*One*) *vêli* of land (*which was called after*) **Râjavibhâṭa⁷** (*and*) which formed part of **Vaḍakarai-Veṇkônkuḍi** in our dominions, (*was given to the temple*) for (*defraying the expense of*) decorating a *maṇḍapa* on the festive day, on which the beautiful lord of **Tiruvânaikkâ** is carried in procession to **Vaḍakarai-Veṇkônkuḍi** for the sacred hunt (*tiru-vêṭṭai*) ;⁸ for one plate of rice which is offered at the daily worship to the goddess **Akhilâṇḍa-nâyakî** and afterwards treated as sacrificial remnants (*i.e.* distributed);⁹ for the rice to be offered at the festival in (*the month of*) **Mârgali ;¹⁰** and for the maintenance¹¹ of a gardener¹² who cultivates the temple garden.

......(L. 6.) â€œ(*The donee*) shall enjoy, for the above-mentioned purposes, as long as the sun and the moon last, the taxes on this *vÃªli* of land, the income gold (*and*) the income in paddy.

......(L. 8.) “If there be any person who injures this charity, he shall incur the sin of killing a cow on the blank of the Gaṅgâ.”

......¹ Read *amudu* throughout the inscription.  
......² Read *śêrtta*.  
......³ This is a corruption of the Sanskṛit *ahitam*.  
......⁴ *Konra* is pleonastic ; the correct expression would be *gô-vadaiyai śeyda.*  
......⁵ According to the *Dictionnaire Tamoul-Francais,* the *Mahâmagam, Mâmagam, Mâmâgam* or *Mâmaṅgam* \[*Mahâmâgha* in Sanskṛit\] is “a festival which is celebrated every twelve years at Kumbhakôṇam on the full-moon of Mâśi, *i.e.* February, when Jupiter and the Moon are in conjunction in the 10th lunar constellation, called *Magam* \[*Maghâ* in Sanskṛit\], which forms part of the sign of Leo. Then crowds of people go to bathe in the sacred tank, called Mâmaga-kkuḷam or Mâmaga-ttîrttam, where the waters of the Ganges are supposed to arrive by invisible channels. This festival serves as an epoch in the country ; thus they say : ‘It is three ***Mâmâgam*** (*i.e.* 36 years) that he died.’ In Malabar this was also the period of the government of a viceroy under the kings of Vijayanagara.” See also Dr. Fleet’s *Gupta Inscriptions*, Introduction, pp. 119 and 167.  
......⁶ On Âdi-Chaṇḍêśvara see *South-Indian Inscriptions*, Vol. I. p. 92, note 6, and on *dêvar-kanmi,* ‘a *pûjârî*,’ Vol. II. p. 112.  
......⁷ This word occurs as a *biruda* of Vijayanagara kings in Kanarese inscriptions.  
......⁸ This evidently refers to the procession on the day of *Vijayadaśamî*, which is even now celebrated in all the temples.  
......⁹ *Tanmav-echcham* appears to be used in the sense of *prasâda*.  
......¹⁰ This refers to the worship at about 4 A.M. during the month of Mârgali.  
......¹¹ *Ilakkai* appears to be a vulgar form of *irakshai* (Sanskṛit *rakshâ*).  
......¹² *Tôppu-âḷ* or *top-âḷ* and *top-âṇḍi* mean ‘a devotee who attends to groves.’ (*Winslow*.)
