****SATYAMANGALAM PLATES OF DEVARAYA II.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

introduces a younger brother of Dêvarâya II., whose name was **Pratâpa-Dêvarâya,** and who, to judge from verse 21, appears to have held a high office, perhaps that of co-regent, under his royal brother. I subjoin a pedigree of the first Vijayanagara dynasty, in which I have entered the new details supplied by the present inscription, by an inscription of Saṁgama II. (*ante*, No. 4), and by other inscriptions which have been lately discovered :—

......¹ In previous tables (*Journal, Bombay Branch, R. A. S.,* Vol. XII. p. 339, and *South-Indian Inscriptions,* Vol. I. p. 161), Śaka-Saṁvat 1290 \[expired\], the Kîlaka year, was entered as the latest known date of Bukka I. Mr. Cousens has since furnished me with impressions of two subsequent inscriptions in the Kanarese language at Bhaṭkaḷ, *viz*. a copper-plate of a Vîra-Bukkarâya, dated in Śaka-Saṁvat 1291 \[expired\], the Saumya year, and a stone inscription of Vîra-Bukkaṇṇa-Oḍeyar of Vijayanagara (*thus*), dated in **Śaka-Saṁvat 1293** \[expired\], the Virôdhikṛit year.  
......² This Kanarese name was read by Colebrooke (*Miscellaneous Essays,* Madras edition, Vol. II. p. 257) as Mudgara (‘the protector of beans’), in which form it has found its way into Böhtlingk and Roth’s *Sanskṛit- Wörterbuch,* and from it into Sir Monier Williams’ *Sanskṛit Dictionary.*

......³ *South-Indian Inscriptions,* Vol. I. No. 55. That this inscription has to be attributed to Bukka II. was first recognised by Mr. Venkayya ; *Madras Christian College Magazine* for March 1892. Another Tamil inscription of Bukka II., dated in Saka-Saṁvat 1328, expired, the Vyaya year, is engraved on the east wall of the Naṭarâja shrine in the Êkâmranâtha temple at Kâñchî.  
......⁴ Śaka-Saṁvat 1330, the Sarvajit year, is the date of a Kanarese inscription of Dêvarâya at Bhaṭkaḷ, impressions of which I owe to the kindness of Mr. Cousens.  
......⁵ See Mr. Venkayya’s article, *loc. cit.*  
......⁶ This is the date of the Vandavâśi plates, which were published by Dr. Oppert in the *Madras Journal of Literature and Science* for 1881, pp. 249 ff. The inscription records the grant of the village of Cheṭṭupêḍu in the kingdom (*râjya*) of Paḍabîḍu. This is the modern Paḍavêḍu in the Pôlûr tâlukâ of the North Arcot district ; see *South-Indian Inscriptions,* Vol. I. p. 83.  
......⁷ This name is taken from verse 21 of the present inscription.  
......⁸ On this and the two next kings see *Ind. Ant.* Vol. XXI. p. 321 f. and *Madras Christian College Magazine, loc. cit. .*  
......⁹ See my *Annual Report* for 1891-92, p. 9.
