......¹ See p. 125, note 5.  
......² This name is probably derived from Ahôbilam, a famous Vaishņava shrine in the Karṇûl district, which is mentioned in inscriptions of Harihara II. and later Vijayanagara kings.  
......³ *Adhvarin-and yajvan* (v. 30 f.) appear to be synonymons with *adhvarya,* ‘a student of the Yajurvêda.’  
......⁴ This verse has to be construed with verse 29, before which it ought to stand. The composer appear to hare copied it from earlier Vijayanagara grants without the necessary discrimination.
