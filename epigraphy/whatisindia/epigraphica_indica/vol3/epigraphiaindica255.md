who was the support of scholars (*or of gods*), (*and*) who destroyed the inward pleasure of (*his*) enemies (*or of bees*).¹

......(V. 52.) To him was born a chief of **Nâyakas, Viśvapa,** a moon to the darkness (*which were*) hostile kings. To him was born the brave (*and*) glorious lord **Muddukṛishṇa,** who resembled (*the mountain*) Mêru in firmness.

......(V. 53.) He had two sons, the lord **Mudduvîra** and prince **Tirumala,** who were the receptacles of the continuous stream of the deep compassion of (*the goddess*) **Mînâkshî** and (*the god*) **Sundarêśa,²** who were resplendent with their fame which spread from the Kailâsa mountain to (Râma’s) bridge, and whose respected command (*resembled*) an ornament of splendid jewels in the diadems of kings.

......(V. 54.) Then, having been eagerly anointed to the sovereignty over the whole kingdom by many chiefs of ministers, (*and*) having obtained the whole surface of the earth through the great compassion of (*the god*) **Sundarêśa,** prince **Tirumala** shines (*like*) an Indra on earth.

......(Vv. 55-59.) Sanctioning the request of this glorious prince **Tirumala,─** the strength of whose arm was hard to be resisted by the enemies, who was a Sutrâman (Indra) on earth in happiness, who was a *kalpa* tree on earth in liberality, whose enemies ascended high mountains as soon as he ascended (*his*) mighty elephant, who surpassed the enemy of the ocean (*i.e.* the submarine fire) in attacking a town for conquest, who spent the time in gifts of brides, food, gold and land, (*and*) whose beauty surpassed that of Jayanta, the Moon, and Cupid,— the glorious king **Vîra-Veṅkaṭapatimahârâya** joyfully made (*the above*) grant with libations of water (*poured*) over gold.³ (*The names of*) the Brâhmaṇas, deeply versed in the Vêdas, who received shares of this (*grant*), are written (*here*) :—

......¹ The letters *ra* and *la* or *ḷa* are interchangeable in such *alaṁkâras* ; see the commentary on Subandhu’s *Vâsavadattâ,* verse 1 :— ![](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/epigraphica_indica/vol3/images/1302.bmp).  
......² These are the names of the god at the Madhurâ temple and of his consort.  
......³ The Hindû Śâstras consider a charity inefficient, if not accompanied by a *dakshiṇâ* ; see the *Bhagavadgîtâ,* xvii. 13, and the *Chaṇḍakauśika.* Gold is invariably chosen for this purpose ; for at every gift the following *anushṭubh* verse is recited :—

Accordingly, during the performance of the sixteen great *dânas*, people who can afford it, keep a piece of gold generally a *fanam,* in their hand, pour water over it into the donee’s hand, and then offer the piece as *dakshiṇâ.* In the case of poor people, a silver or copper coin takes the place of the gold piece.  
......⁴ \[This erroneous form is developed from the expression *Harita-sagôtra,* ‘a member of the *gôtra* of the Haritas.’ Similar cases of popular etymology are *sura, sapatna, Pramôdûta* and *Pramâḍîcha* (*South-Indian-Inscriptions,* Vol. I. p. 109, note 2), and *gurava* (*ibid.* Vol. II. p. 251, note 3).— E.
