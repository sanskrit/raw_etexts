****NADUPURU GRANT OF ANNA-VEMA.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

bird Garuḍa. He is represented as a man, with wings, squatting full front, with the hands clasped on the breast, and under the wing on his left shoulder is seen a hooded serpent, its head projecting from behind. The total height of the image and ring is about 4¾”. The weight of the four plates is 4 lbs. 8 oz., and of the ring and image, 9¾ oz. ; total, 5 lbs. 1¾ oz. The engraving is good, and, with the exception of one or two *aksharas* which are partly effaced, the writing is well preserved throughout.— The **size of the letters** is about 3/16”. The **characters** are Nâgarî, and the **language** is Sanskṛit. Up to about the middle of line 33 the inscription. after the introductory *ôṁ ôṁ namaḥ Śivâya*, has 21 verses (interrupted by a short prose passage between verses 10 and 11), chiefly containing genealogical matter. The rest, being the formal part of the grant, is in prose, but includes, in lines 38-40, 62-67, and 69-71, seven benedictive and imprecatory verses, and, in lines 74-75, another verse on the requisites of a faultless charter. As regards **orthography,** the letter *b* is everywhere denoted by the sign for *v* ; the dental sibilant is ten times used for the palatal,¹ and the palatal twice for the dental (in *âśit,* lines 11 and 21) ; the consonant *m* has been retained, instead of being changed to *anusvâra,* in the word *samvatsara,* twice in l. 41, and in *paradattâm=vâ,* l. 69 ; and *sh* is wrongly doubled after *r Akâlavarshshô,* l. 9, and probably was so doubled by the writer also in lines 8 and 10, where the engraver has put =*môghavarshyô* and =*môghavarshyaḥ* (instead of *ºvarshshô* and *ºvarshshaḥ*). The sign of *avagraha* is employed six times. In respect of the language, it may be mentioned that the text offers two words which are Draviḍan : *pâṭî* in 1. 21, and the first member of the compound name *Avvêśvara* in l. 42 ; and that it contains some words the meaning of which is not apparent (notably *jîvalôka,* in l. 49, *châkântara* and *jûhaka,* in l. 50, and *jagatîpura,* in l. 59). A wrong verse we find in line 29 ; and another verse, in line 27, contains a passage which, as it stands, does not seem to yield any satisfactory meaning.

......The inscription is one of the **Silâra²** *Maṇḍalika* **Raṭṭarâja.** Like the Bhâdâna grant of the Śîlâra Aparâjita,³ it divides itself into two parts. The first part, up to lie 33, gives the genealogy of **Raṭṭarâja,** and of the **Râshṭrakûṭa** and (Western) **Châlukya** kings to whom he and his ancestors were subordinate ; and the second part records various donations, made by him in Śaka-Saṁvat 930, in favour of some learned men connected with a temple of the god (Śiva, under the name) **Avvêśvara.⁴**

......Opening with the words ‘ôṁ, ôṁ, adoration to Śiva,’ the inscription first invokes the protection of the god Îśa (Śiva). It then glorifies the family of the **Râshṭrakûṭa** lords, ‘the ornament of **Yadu’s** race,’ and gives (in verses 3-8) the following well-known list of kings of that family :— 1, **Dantidurga ;** 2, his father’s brother **Kṛishṇarâja ;** 3, his son **Gôvindarâja ;** 4, **Nirupama ;** 5, his son **Jagattuṅgadêva ;** 6, his son **Amôghavarsha ;** 7, his son **Akâlavarsha ;** 8, his grandson **Indrarâja ;** 9, his son **Amôghavarsha ;** 10, his younger brother **Gôvîndarâja,** ‘an abode of the sentiment of love, surrounded by crowds of lovely women ;’ 11, his father’s brother, the son of Jagattuṅga,⁵ **Vaddiga ;** 12, his son **Kṛishṇarâja ;** 13, his brother **Khôṭika ;** and 14, his brother’s son **Kakkala.** Verses 9 and 10 then tell us that, having defeated kakkala, **Tailapa** of the **Châlukya** lineage became king, and that he was succeeded by his son **Satyâśraya ;** and a short prose passage in lines 20-21 intimates that this grant of Raṭṭarâja’s

......¹ In some parts of the inscription it is difficult to distinguish between the signs for *ś* and *s,* and between those for *ch, dh, v,* and *p.*  
......² So the name is given here, in lines 22, while in the Bhâdâna grant of Aparâjita (No. 37 above) it is written *Śîlâra,* and in the Kôlhâpur inscription of Vijayâditya (Nos. 27 and 28 above) *Śiḷâhâra.*  
......³ See the preceding note.  
......⁴ I take the first member of this compound to be the Kanarese word *avva avve,* mother,’ and would compare such names of Śiva *as Ambikêśvara, Ambikâpati, Ambâpati,* etc.  
......⁵ This Jagattuṅga was the son of Akâlavarsha and father of Indrarâja.
