****VANAPALLI PLATES OF ANNA-VEMA.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

......(V. 5.) In this (*world*) is **victorious the fourth caste,** which was produced from the lotus-foot of Śauri **(Vishṇu),** (*and*) whose sister, the river **(Gaṅgâ),** purifies the (*three*) worlds by (*her*) threefold course.

......(V. 6.) From this (*caste*), as the moon from the ocean, sprang king **Prôla,** the only protector of the earth, a treasury of knowledge, whose appearance always satisfield learned men, as that of the moon does the gods (*whom she supplies with nectar*).

......(V. 7.) In consequence of the good deeds (*in former births*) of this king **Prôla,** there was born (*to him*) an excellent son, called king **Vêma,** the virtuous chief of princes.

......(V. 8.) While this righteous prince was ruling, the goddess of the Earth witnessed great festivals and suddenly forgot the pain of her separation from king Hariśchandra and other (*virtuous ancient kings*).

......(V. 9.) How¹ can it be described, the conduct of the lord **Vêma,** who performed all the gifts (*described by*) **Hêmâdri,²** who enjoyed (*only as much of*) the earth as remained (*after the deduction of that portion*) which was enjoyed by the twice-born, (*and*) who produced the seven kinds of offspring ?³

......(V. 10.) Having built (*a flight of*) steps on the path of the **Pâtâḷagaṅgâ,⁴** King **Vêma,** converted **Śrîśailam** into a pillar (*which records*) his pious gifts. Being worshipped in the hall (*âsthâna*) by crowds of gods, demi-gods, and ascetics, the god continually proclaims his (*the kings’s*) fame by (*his*) faces, *viz*. that of Tatpurusha⁵ and the other (*four*).⁶

......(V. 11.) King **Vêma’s** son was king **Anna-Vôta,** the greatness of whose valour was unequalled, who was devoted to the gifts (*described by*) **Hêmâdri,** who was the husband of the goddess of heroes, who ruled the whole earth⁷ by means of the sword in (*his*) arm, and who converted the three worlds into a single ocean by the streams of the flood of (*his*) fame.

......(V. 12.) Having conquered the earth by his power, as Jishṇu⁸ by his spear, having bestowed *agrahâras* on Brâhmaṇas, (*and*) having fulfilled the desires of the multitude of his relatives, this king obtained the fruit of (*his*) birth (*i.e.* he died).

......(V. 13.) His younger brother (was) king **Anna-Vêma,** (*surnamed*) **Jaganobbagaṇḍa,⁹** who was beloved by (*the goddess of*) Fame, (*and*) whose conduct on earth became a standard for those who are engaged in the practice of virtue (*dharma*), wealth (*artha*), and pleasure (*kâma*).

......(V. 14.) While this king is seated on the lion-throne in (*his*) capital, the prosperous city of **Koṇḍavîṭî,** hostile kings, out of jealousy as it were, migrate to mountains which bear the lairs of very terrible lions.¹⁰

......¹ *Kim* appears to be used in the sense of *katham*.  
......² Hêmâdri, the author of the *Dânakhaṇḍa,* was the minister of the two Yâdava kings Mahâdêva and Râmachandra ; see Dr. Bhandarkar’s *Early History of the Dekkan,* p. 88 f. Compare also *Ep. Ind.* Vol. I. p. 368, note 58.  
......³ The seven kinds of offspring (*saṁtâna* or *saṁtati*) are seven duties, whose performance is equally meritorious as the procreation of a son. They are thus enumerated in verse 43 of the Gaṇapêśvaram inscription of Gaṇapati (No. 15 below) :―

......⁴ According to Brown’s *Telugu Dictionary,* this is “the name of that branch of the Kṛishṇâ which flows past Śrîśailam,” See also the *Kurnool Manual,* p. 183.  
......⁵ According to Winslow’s *Tamil Dictionary*, s. v. *tarpuruḍam,* this is “one of the five faces of Śiva, indicative of his attributes as preserver.”  
......⁶ It may be concluded from the second half of this verse that Vêma built a hall in the temple of Śrîśailam.  
......⁷ Literally, “the earth which possessed the splendour of a single (royal) parasol.”  
......⁸ This word appears to be used here as a name of the god Subrahmaṇya, whose attribute is the spear (*śakti*). In verse 17 it is used fo Indra.  
......⁹ *i.e.* “the only hero in the world.” Compare Brown’s *Telugu Dictionary,* s. v. *obba*.  
......¹⁰ The real cause for this action of the kings was, of course, that they had to flee before Anna-Vêma.
