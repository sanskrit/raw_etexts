****TIRUKKALUKKUNRAM INSCRIPTIONS.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

of Râjârâjadêva and in all subsequent Tamiḷ inscriptions. Assuming that the cessation of the employment of the *puḷḷi* was gradual, the comparative frequency of its occurrence may be used as an argument to establish the priority of the present inscription to the time of Parântaka I. Again, in the subjoined inscription, the upper horizontal strokes peculiar to certain Tamil letters are represented by slight curves opening upwards, which remind of similar curves in the corresponding letters of the Sanskṛit inscriptions of the Pallava kings Râjasiṁha and Mahêndravarman at Conjeeveram. On palæographical grounds we must, therefore, conclude that this is one of the oldest Tamil inscriptions yet discovered, though we cannot ascertain even its approximate date. The contents of the inscription do not furnish any materials for this purpose. Râjakêsarivarman renewed, at the request of a certain Puttan *(i.e.* **Buddha**), a grant which had been made by Skandaśishya and confirmed by Narasiṁhavarman, both of whom are spoken of as “former kings” (*pûrva-râjâkkaḷ*). It is not said what the nature of the grant was that had originally been made by Skandaśishya, nor do we learn the circumstances that led to the petition (*viṇṇappam*) of Puttaṇ for a renewal of the grant. But so much is certain that, at the time of **Râjakêsarivarman,** a portion of the **Pallava** dominions had passed into the hands of the **Chôḷas.**

......In this and in the following three inscriptions, **Tirukkaḷikkinram** is said to have been situated in **Kaḷattûr-kôṭṭam** and “in the subdivision (*kûru*) called after itself,”¹ In the **Appendix** to his *Manual of the Chingleput District,* Mr. Crole gives a list of *kôṭṭams* with the subdivisions contained in some of them. Among the former he mentions “Kallattur-kottam” in the Chigleput tâlukâ, which is evidently identical with the Kaḷattûr-koṭṭam of the Tirukkaḷukkunram inscriptions.

**TRANSLATION.**

......(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! In the twenty-seventh year (*of the rign*) of king **Râjakêsarivarman.**

......(L. 2.) “Whereas **Skandaśishya** had given (*certain land*) free from taxes to the feet of the god of the holy Mûlasthâna (*temple*) at **Tirukkalukkunram in Kaḷattûr-kôṭṭam** (*and*) in

......¹ The actual name of this subdivision was probably Tirukkalukkunṛa-kûru.  
......² The *aksharas* from *sva* of *svasti* to *ja* of *râja* are engraved over an erasure.  
......³ Above the *tu* of *kunrattu* is engraved some letter which looks like the modern Tamil *śa,* and over the word *Mûlasthâna,* the modern Tamil numeral ‘twenty-one.’  
......⁴ The engraver had originally written *śya* instead of *śi* and then partially erased the *y.*  
......⁵ The reading *Vâdâvi* or *Vâtâpi* is also possible ; Pâdâvi, Vâdâvi and Vâtâpi are ancient names of Bâdâmi in the Bombay Presidency.  
......⁶ The *aksharas* from *jâ* to *ḷ* appear to be engraved over an erasure.  
......⁷ Over the *pa* of *paḍi,* the modern Tamil numeral ‘five’ seems to be engraved.  
......⁸ The engraver had originally written *ja* instead of *sa* and then corrected only the bottom, leaving the top as it stood.
