**TRANSLATION.**

......(Line 1.) Let there be prosperity ! Obeisance to the blessed Gaṇâdhipati !

......(Verse 1.) Adoration to Śaṁbhu **(Śiva),** who is the adorned, as with a *châmara,* with the moon that is kissing (*his*) lofty head, (*and*) who is the principal pillar at the building of the city (*which consists*) of the three worlds !

......(V. 2.) Let it protect you,― the staff-like tusk of Hari **(Vishṇu),** who disported himself as a boar, (*placed*) on which (*tusk*) the Earth resembled a parasol, with the golden mountain (Mêru) as it point !

......(V. 3.) I make obeisance to **Vighnêśvara (Gaṇapati),** the remover of obstacles, whose feet are dyed yellow by the mass of the stamina of golden lotus-flowers.

......(V. 4.) Let it always bring you prosperity,― the body of **Vishṇu,** the primeval Boar, who carries on the tip of (*his*) huge tusk the Earth along with Śrî (Lakshmî) !

......(V. 5.) Obeisance to that **Boar,** on whose graceful tusk rests the Earth !― On this (*earth*) (*are performed*) sacrifices by good men who know the meaning of the Vêdas ; by these (*sacrifices*) the gods are pleased ; the head of the race of these (*gods*) (*is*) Hari (Indra) ; to him (Indra) belong the clouds ; these (*clouds*) pour forth rain ; by rain all creepers and grain grow ; (*and*) by these, the men created by Pitâmaha (Brahmâ) are gladdened.

......(V. 6.) There was (*produced*) **the Moon,** who supports the life (*of the inhabitants*) of the three worlds, who appears to be an incarnation of joy, (*and who is*) the chief ornament on the diadem of Paramêśvara (Śiva).

......(V. 7.) In his (*the Moon’s*) race, there was a glorious ruler of the earth, (*called*) **Yadu,** after which praiseworthy (*king*) the descendants of the race of the Moon are (*also*) called **Yâdavas.**

......(V. 8) In this praiseworthy race of Yadu was born that glorious lord **Saṁgama,** by whom all subjects were protected according to the ancient rules.

......(V. 9.) The lotus of his fame had the golden mountain (Mêru) for its seed-vessel, (*and*) the great Mandâkinî (Gaṅgâ) river for a stream of honey.
