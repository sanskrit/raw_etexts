and *dauhittra,* line 35, but not in *tri,* line 23 ; and (4) the doubling of *d* before *r,* in *bhûmichchhiddra,* lines 42-43, and *bhaddra,* line 44.

......The **inscription** refers itself, in lines 5 and 6, to the reign of **the Râshṭrakûṭa king Prabhûtavarsha-Jagattuṅga-Gôvinda III. ;¹** and, in line 12, to the time of his nephew and feudatory, **Gôvindarâja of Gujarât.** And the object of it is to record that a subordinate of Gôvindarâja, **the Mahâsâmanta Buddhavarasa,**² **of the Śalukika family,** granted to some Brâhmaṅs **a village named Gôvaṭṭaṇa,** situated in an estate, belonging to him, which was known as the **Sîharakhî or Sîharakkhî Twelve.**

......The **date** on which the grant was made, is the seventh *tithi,* called *vijaya-saptami* (line 43),― the week-day is not mentioned,― of the bright fortnight of the month Pausha in the Nandana *saṁvatsara,* Śaka-Saṁvat 735 ; the year being expressed both in words and in decimal figures. The *saṁvatsara* may be determined either by the mean-sign system, according to which it began on the 9th May, A.D. 812, in Śaka-Saṁvat 735 current, and ended on the 5th May, A.D. 813, in Ś.-S. 736 current ; or by the southern luni-solar system, according to which it coincided with Ś.-S. 735 current. In either case the given Śaka year has to be applied as **a current year.** And, for the *tithi,* the corresponding English date is **the 14th December, A.D. 812 ;** on this day the *tithi* was current during all the daylight hours, and ended at about 31 *gh.* 10 *p.,* = 12 hours 28 minutes, after mean sunrise (for Bombay).

......As regards the **places** that are mentioned, **Sîharakhî** or **Sîharakkhî** is very probably the modern **‘Serkhi,’** which, according to the *Postal Directory of the Bombay Circle,* seems to be somewhere close in the neighbourhood of Baroda. But I have no maps at hand in which to look for its exact position, and to see if any modern representatives of Gôvaṭṭaṇa and its hamlet (?) Mêshuvallikâ can be found.

......¹ I take this opportunity of publishing a revised table of the Râshṭrakûṭa dynasty of Mâlkhêḍ, with its Gujarât branches. The numbers prefixed to some of the names indicates the members of the family who actually reigned and the order in which they succeeded each other.  
......² The termination of this name seems clearly to be the Kanarese *arasa,* ‘a king’. The person, therefore, had probably migrated to Gujarât from the Kanarese country.
