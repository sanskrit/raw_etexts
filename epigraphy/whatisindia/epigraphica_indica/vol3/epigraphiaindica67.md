****COCHIN PLATES OF BHASKARA RAVIVARMAN.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

different form which is employed in the larger **Koṭṭayam** grant,¹ occurs. Just as in the two Koṭṭayam grants, the Tirunelli grant, and the grant of Jaṭilavarman,²― **Grantha** letters are used in a number of Sanskṛit words,― *svasti* (line 1 ), *śrî* (l. 1 (twice) and l. 20),³ *sâ* of *pirasâdichchu* (l. 5) and *pirasâdam* (l. 6), *sa* of *santati* (ll. 16, 18, 19). In the foreign word *Îssuppu*, the syllable *ssu* is expressed by a Grantha group (ll. 6 and 16). The inscription ends with a symbol which may be taken either for an ornamental mark of punctuation, or for an archaic Nâgarî *śâ*, which might be meant for *śrî*. If the second eventuality holds good, the approximate period of the inscription could perhaps be settled by a comparison with dated records in which similar forms of *śâ* occur.

......The language of the inscription is **Tamil─** not the artificial language of literary works, but the Tamil of every-day life, which, as the language of the Tanjore inscriptions of the Chôḷas, does not avoid vulgar forms, like *pirasâdichchu* (l. 5 ) for *piraśâdittu*, and *añju* (in *Añjuvaṇṇam*) for *aindu* The world *peḍi* (l. 7) is probably a vulgar form of *piḍi*, ‘a female elephant,’ and *vâyanam* (*l. c.)* is derived from the Sanskṛit *vâhana*.⁴ The form *ippari*, which occurs before each of the attestations on the second plate, appears to be a corruption of the Tamil *ippaḍi*, ‘thus.’ A single word shows that, at the time of the inscription, the Tamil language was beginning to develop into **Malayâḷam**.⁵ This is the adjective participle *śeyyinra* (l . 26), in which the *y* of the root *śey* is assimilated to the following *g,* and which thus supplies the missing link between the Tamil *śeyginra* and the Malayâḷam *cheyyunna*.⁶

......The inscription is dated in the reign of king **Bhâskara Ravivarman,** who is probably identical with a king of the same name, during whose reign the **Tirunelli** grant was issued. The differences between the alphabets of the two records are not more considerable than might be expected in the case of productions of two different writers, who resided in localities at a distance from each other. The king bore the title *Kôgônmai-koṇḍân*, which may be compared with the similar title *Kônêrinmai-koṇḍân*,⁷ and which is synonymous with the Sanskṛit *Râjarâja*. The date of the inscription was “**the thirty-sixth year opposite to the second year.”** As I have shown on a previous occasion,⁸ the meaning of this mysterious phrase is probably “the thirty-sixth year (of the king’s coronation, which took place) after the second year (of the king’s *yauvarâjya*).” The inscription records a grant which the king made to **Îssuppu Irappân** (ll. 6 and 16), *i.e.* Joseph Rabbân. The occurrence of this Semitic name, combined with the two facts that the plates are still with the Cochin Jews, and that the latter possess a Hebrew **translation** of the document,⁹ proves that the donee was a member of the ancient Jewish colony on the western coast. The grant was made at **Muyirikkôḍu** (l. 4. f.). The Hebrew translation identifies this place with **Koḍuṅṅallûr** (Cranganore), where the Jewish colonists resided, until the bad treatment which they received there at the hands of the Portuguese, induced them to settle near Cochin.¹⁰ The object of the grant was **Añjuvaṇṇam** (ll. 7, 8, 15, 19). This word means ‘the five castes’ and may have been the designation of that quarter of
