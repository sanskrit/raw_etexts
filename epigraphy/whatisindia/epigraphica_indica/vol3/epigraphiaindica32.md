**TRANSLATION.**

......(Verse 1.) Let that tusk of Hari (Vishṇu), who disported himself (*in the shape of*) a boar,— (*carried*) on which (*tusk*), as on a staff the Earth appeared to be parasol, with the golden mountain (Mêru) as its point,— protect you !

......(V. 2.) There was a ruler (*called*) king **Saṁgama \[I.\],** whose uncontrolled, high valour,— which was in conformity with the grant pride of his renowned, powerful arm,— overclouded the unchecked fighting-power of hostile kings, (*and*) whose shining, excellent lotus-feet were worshipped by the great splendour of the rubies on the humbly bent heads of crores of princes.

......(Vv. 3 and 4.) From him were produced five heroic sons, as, formerly, the (*five*) celestial trees² from the milk-ocean :— first, king **Harihara ;** then, the ruler of the earth, **Kampa ;** then, the protector of the earth, **Bukka ;** (*and*) afterwards, **Mârapa** and **Muddapa.**

......(V. 5.) Of these, king **Harihara,—** by whom the Sultân (*Suratrâṇa*), who resembled Sutrâman (Indra), was defeated,— ruled the earth for a long time.

......(V. 6.) His younger brother, king **Kampaṇa,** whose name became true to its meaning, as he made the enemies tremble,³ ruled the earth for a long time.

......(V. 7.) His heroic son was king **Saṁgama \[II.\],** just as Jayanta (*was the son*) of Jambhâri (Indra), and as Pradyumna (*was the son*) of Śârṅgin (Kṛishṇa).

......(V. 8.) Ah ! surely, Karṇa, the *kalpa* tree, and the celestial cow eagerly watch his compassionate glance, which fulfils the desires of supplicants.⁴

......(V. 9.) It is because she is desirous of resting on his arm (*and*) unwilling to choose another, that, for a long time, the goddess of Victory enters battles and practises the vow of (*walking on*) the edges of swords.⁵

......(V. 10.) While, by the extensive spreading of his fame, the three worlds experienced supreme delight, the moon was successful in nothing but in causing the water-lilies to unfold.⁶

......(V. 11.) “Here comes the glorious lord of both the Eastern and Western oceans, the disgracer of the wicked kings that break their promises, the destroyer of the armies of opposing

......² The author here uses the word *kalpa* for the celestial trees in general, though it is strictly applicable to one of them alone ; see *Amarakôśa*, i. 1, verse 53. For a similar use of the word in the general sense, compare ![](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/epigraphica_indica/vol3/images/54.bmp) ; *Naishadha*, canto xiii. verse 1.  
......³ The poet derives Kampaṇa from *kampayati*, ‘he causes to tremble.’  
......⁴ This verse implies that Saṁgama’s donations were admired, but not equaled, by Karṇa, the *kalpa* tree, and the celestial cow, who are noted for their unbounded liberality.  
......⁵ The purport of this verse is, that Saṁgama II. had not to fight for victory, but that victory came to him of its own accord.  
......⁶ This verse implies that the moon, which had hitherto pleased the whole world, was beaten in that respect by the fame of Saṁgama II. and served no practical purpose, but to induce the night-lotus to open its flowers.
