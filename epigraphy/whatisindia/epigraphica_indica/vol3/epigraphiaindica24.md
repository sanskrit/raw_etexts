**BITRAGUNTA GRANT OF SAMGAMA II.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Professor Aurfect,¹ he died in died in A.D. 1387. All that we can at present gather regarding the genealogy of Mâdhava and Sâyaṇa, is as follows :—

.............................................**Mayana  
.............................................married Srimati.**  
.........................................................**I**...........................................................................  
........**I**............................................... **I.**..............................................**I**  
Madhava,.....................Sayana, Minsiter of Samgama II. ...........Bhoganatha,  
ministerof Bukka I .........and of Harihara II. ...............................court-jester  
of Samgama II.

......According to Mr. Sewell’s *Lists of Antiquities,* Vol. I. p. 142, **Biṭraguṇṭa,** the first of the villages granted, is situated 7 miles south by west of **Kâvali,** which is 32 miles from Nellûr (Nellore) and is the head-quarters of the **Kâvali tâlûka** in the Nellore district. Its situation is described in the inscription as being 3 *yôjanas* north of the town of **Vikramasiṁhapura** in the district called **Pâkavishaya,** which was situated on the shore of the Eastern ocean, *i.e.* the Bay of Bengal (verse 19). I do not know if the name Vikramasiṁhapura still exists ; but the name Pâka survives in the name of a certain sect of Telugu-speaking Śûdras in the Mysore territory, who profess to come from Pâkanâḍu, the country of Pâka, and are as such called **Pâkanâṭis.** The other village, **Siṁkêśari,** is said to be situated in the district called **Mulikidêśa** on the northern bank of Pennâ, *i.e.* the well-known **Pennêr** river, and to the north of the Śaiva temple at **Pushpâchala** (verse 24), which is identical with **Pushpagiri,** 8 miles north of Kaḍapa (Cuddapah). A native of Pushpagiri informed me that close to Pushpagiri is a village named **Suṅkêsaru,** which appears to be the same as the Siṁkêśari of the grant. It may be also remarked that a certain class of Smârta Brâhmaṇas, who call themselves **Mulikinâḍuvâru,** profess to have emigrated from the Muliki country. The other places mentioned in the inscription as the boundaries of the two villages (verses 22 and 25) I am unable to identify. But so much is certain that **Saṁgama II.** held portions of the present **Nellore and Cuddapah districts,** while his uncle **Bukka I.** was reigning at **Vijayanagara.** Saṁgama II. can scarcely have been dependent on Bukka I., as he would have otherwise referred to the latter as his overlord in his inscription. The fact that he represents his own father **Kampa** as the actual successor of **Harihara I.** also suggests that he considered himself entirely independent of **Bukka I.**
