**No. 41.─ VERAWAL IMAGE INSCRIPTION ;  
  
VALABHI-SAMVAT 927.  
  
BY F. KIELHORN, PH.D., LL.D., C.I.E. ; GÖTTINGEN.**

......This inscription, which was discovered by the late Dr. Bhagvanlal Indraji, is on the pedestal of an old image, built into a wall of the modern. temple of the goddess Harsaṭadêvî, at **Vêrâwal,** the ancient **Sômanâthadêvapattana,** in Kâṭhiâwâḍ.⁶ It has been already published in *Archæplogical Survey* of *Western India,* No. 11 (*List of Antiquarian Remains, Bombay Presidency*), p. 185. I now re-edit it from an un-inked paper estampage, kindly procured by Mr. Haridas Viharidas, Diwâṇ of Junâgaḍh, which has been placed at my disposal by Dr. Fleet.⁷

......The inscription contains five lines of writing which covers a space of exactly 1’ broad by 2½” high, and is well preserved throughout. The **size of the letters** is about ⅜” The **characters** are the kind of Nâgarî which we find in the Jaina palm-leaf MSS. of the 12th and 13th centuries. The **language** is Sanskṛit, rendered incorrect by the influence of Prâkṛit, which shows itself in the spelling of names, in the absence of the proper case-terminations, and in the employment of the form *kârâpitâ*, for *kâritâ,* in line 5 ; and the whole text is in prose.

......The object of the inscṛiption is, to record that, on a date which will be given below, the *śrêshṭhin* Mûlajôga, a member of the Gallaka⁸ caste (or clan), and his wife, the *śrêshṭhinî* Môḍhî ; their son, the sellar of perfumes Jôjâ, and his wife Shêvaḍa ; and their sons Jayatâ.

......¹ Metre : Ślôka (Anushṭubh) ; and of the next verse.  
......² Read -*dattâṁ vâ.*  
......³ Read *shashṭiṁ*.  
......⁴ After this, one would have expected the word *tathâ* ; compare the grant of Aparâjita, above, p. 275, text line 83.  
......⁵ Metre : Ślôka (Anushṭubh).  
......⁶ See Dr. Fleet’s *Gupta Inscriptions,* Introduction, p. 91 ; *Ind. Ant.* Vol. XI. p. 241 ; and the *Bombay Gazetteer,* Vol. VIII. p. 686.  
......⁷ The photo-lithograph opposite page 306 is from Dr. Bhagvanlal Indraji’s cloth-rubbing.— \[Regarding the painted inscription of the Mahârâja Bhîmasêna, which is reproduced on the same Plate, see Sir A. Cuningham’s *Reports,* Vol. XXI. p. 119 f. and Plate xxx.— E. H.\]  
......⁸ \[Compare the Kanarese and Telugu *golla,* ‘a cowherd.’— E. H.\]
