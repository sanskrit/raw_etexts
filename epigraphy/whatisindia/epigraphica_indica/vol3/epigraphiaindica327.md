****RECORDS OF THE SOMAVAMSI KINGS OF KATAK.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The Sômavaṁśi Kings of Kaṭak.**

The Somavamsi Kings of Katak.  
Sivagupta.  
Janamejaya-Maha-Bhavagupta I.  
Yayati-  
maha-Sivagupta.  
Bhimaratha-  
Maha-Bhavagupta II.

......**And as to the first of them,** the facts are these. **A.** names, in the formal part of the record, a paramount king named **Śivagupta,** and his successor **Mahâ-Bhavagupta (I.)** who made the grant ; it is dated in the sixth year of a paramount king named **Janamêjaya ;** and it ends with a verse in praise of this latter king, who, like Mahâ-Bhavagupta (I.), is attributed to **the Lunar Race. E.** opens by mentioning in verse a king named **Janamêjaya,** and his son **Yayâti ;** then, in the formal part of the record, it names a paramount king named **Mahâ-Bhavagupta (I.),** and his successor **Mahâ-Śivagupta** who made the grant ; and it is dated in the ninth year of **Yayâti,** to whose name there are here attached the paramount titles, just as in the case of Mahâ-Śivagupta, and who, like Mahâ-Śivagupta, is here described as belonging to the **family of the Moon,** and as being **the lord of the three Kaliṅgas.** And **F.,** after mentioning in the opening verses three kings named **Janamêjaya, Yayâti, and Bhimaratha,** names, in the formal part of the record, the paramount king **Mahâ-Śivagupta,** and his successor **Mahâ-Bhavagupta (II.)** who made the grant ; and it is dated in the third year of **Bhîmaratha,** to whose name there are here attached just the same paramount titles which are attached to the name of Mahâ-Bhavagupta (II.), and who, just like Mahâ-Bhavagupta (II.) in this record and Mahâ- Śivagupta in E., is here described as belonging to **the family of the Moon,** and as being **the lord of the three Kaliṅgas.** It is true that the fact is not specifically stated.

But it is *self-evident* that we have the names of **four kings, Śivagupta, Mahâ-Bhavagupta I., Mahâ-Śivagupta, and Mahâ-Bhavagupta II.,** each the father of his successor, and that **Janamêjaya, Yayâti, and Bhîmaratha were simply fanciful names of the second, third and fourth of them.** They were **paramount kings of the Kôsala country ;** for, the charters issued in the thirty-first year of Mahâ-Bhavagupta I. style him *Kôsal-êndra* or “lord of Kôsala” and convey village in different divisions of the Kôsala territory,─ Mahâ-Śivagupta’s charter conveys a village in, plainly, Dakshiṇa-Kôsalâ or Southern Kôsala,─ and the charter of Mahâ-Bhavagupta II. conveys a village in yet another division of Kôsala : and, unless one of their titles, *tri-Kaliṅg-âdhipati,* was simply a meaningless attribute, they were **also paramount kings of the territory that was known as the three Kaliṅgas,** and which included evidently Kaṭak or ‘Cuttack,’ and probably the whole of Orissa. **Their capital seems to have been Kaṭak,** which is mentioned by name in A., B., C., and D., as the place from which those charters were issued : E. and F., however, were issued from other **towns named Vinîtapura and Yayâtinagara,** both, like Kaṭak, on the Mahânadî ; these place have not been identified;¹ but it appears possible that the names are fanciful names for Kaṭak itself. And they claimed to

......¹ Regarding the point that Yayâtinagara cannot be the modern Jâjpur, see page 355 below.
