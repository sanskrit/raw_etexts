**TRANSLATION.**

......Ôm ! In seven centuries, increased by thirty-five (years), of the years that have gone by from the time of the Ṡaka king (or kings), on the seventh tithi in the bright fortnight of the (the month) Pausha ; or, in figures, the centuries of years 735, in the Nandana saṁvatsara, (the month) Pausha, the tithi 7 of the bright fortnight ; on this (*tithi*), specified as above by the year (or *saṁvatsara*) and month and fortnight and day :³―

......(Line 3.)— (*There is*) the *Paramabhaṭṭâraka, Mahârâdhirâja,* and *Paramêśvara,* **Prabhûtavarsha,** the king of favourites of fortune, by name **Gôvindarâja (III.),―** an enjoyer of the young woman the Earth, who is veiled by a mantle, which is (*his*) fame, that is as spotless as the rays of the autumn moon. Even in the hot weather, the whole sky, in which the rays of the sun are obscured on high by the dense dust (*raised*) by the tall steeds of **Jagattuṅga,** distinctly looks as if the rainy season had come. (And) the greatest possible joy is produced in the hearts of men, through the manner in which he righteously rules the whole kingdom, together with the four oceans.

......(L. 8.)— His brother, **Indrarâja,—** equal in valour to (the god) Indra ; a glorious king on the earth ; the source of the production of wondrous fame,— became the ruler of **the province of the lord of Lâṭa,** which was bestowed by him (Gôvinda III.).

......(L. 10.)— His son was one of great dignity,— with a mind that reveled in the pleasure of learning the meaning of the Śâstras,— who bore aloft, in the first place, the auspicious appellation of “illustrious **Karkarâja,**” accompanied by a secondary name.

......(L. 11.)— His younger brother (*is*) the king **Gôvindarâja,—** verily like another (god) Śaṁbhu personified,— who abides in good morality, just as the god sits on the excellent bull (Nandi), (*and*) who is always worshipped by learned people, just as the god is by (*the other*) gods. His mind is never dulled, either in the height of battle by the arrows, tipped with (sharp) points,⁴ which, discharged from afar on all sides, graze the (*very*) string of (*his*) bow and the feathers (*of his arrow*), or in the rite of charity by suppliants, on the look-out for rewards, who assail (*him*) from afar on all sides through partiality for (*his*) virtues.

......(L. 15.)— At the estate⁵ (*called*) the **Sîharakkhî Twelve,** conferred by him, this person, the illustrious **Buddhavarasa,** a *Mahâsâmanta* who has attained all the *mahâśabdas*,— who has been born in the spotless **Śalukika race ;** who has been anointed on the forehead ; who is the cause of an unequalled fever, hard to be cured, among the wives of (*his*) enemies ; who is a wind that breaks down numerous trees, which are (*his*) enemies, inflated with pride ; whose pure fame (*is*) like the white colour of the rays of the autumn moon, or of a jasmine flower, or of a piece of crystal ; who is the son’s son of the illustrious **Maṇinâga** ; who is

......¹ Metre : Ślôka (Anushṭubh) ; and in the following verse.  
......² Represented by a symbol which is identical with one of the forms of the numerical symbol for 90.  
......³ The context is in line 19,— “This person, the illustrious Buddhavarasa, informs all future kings,” *etc.*  
......⁴ Or, perhaps, “aiming at (*his*) shield.”  
......⁵ *prabhujyamâna.* In the construction in which it stands, the word is not a very easy one to translate literally.
