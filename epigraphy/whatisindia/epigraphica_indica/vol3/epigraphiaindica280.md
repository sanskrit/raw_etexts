****TIRUKKALUKKUNRAM INSCRIPTIONS.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

the subdivision called after itself, (*and*) as, accordingly, **Naraśiṅgappôttaraiyar, the conqueror of Vâtâpi,** had confirmed (*the grant*) in the same manner,─ **I, Râjakêsarivarman,** at the request of **Puttan,** the son of **Guṇavan** of **Aṇḍurai,** have maintained (*the grant*) as former kings had maintained it.

......(L. 9.) “The feet of one who protects this charity, shall be on my head !â€?¹

**B.— INSCRIPTION OF PARANTAKA I.**

......This inscription is now published for the first time. It is dated during the 13th year of the reign of **Madirai koṇḍa Parakêsarivarman,** and records the gift of a perpetual lamp to the Tirukkalukkunram temple. Madirai koṇḍa means ‘**who took Madirai (*i.e.* Madhurâ),’** and is sysnonymous with the Sanskṛit Madhurântaka, a name which is applied in the large Leyden grant to two of the successors of Parântaka I.² Several inscriptions of Madirai koṇḍa Parakêsarivarman have already been published,─ three from the Kailâsanâtha temple at Conjeeveram³ and one from Tiruppûnduritti near Tanjore.⁴ The endorsement on the Udayêndiram plates of Nandivarman⁵ and on those of Nandivarman Pallavamalla⁶ are dated during the reign of the same king. The Tamil portion of the Udayêndiram plates of the Gaṅga-Bâṇa king Pṛithivîpati II. *alias* Hastimalla belongs to the reign of the same Madirai koṇḍa Parakêsarivarman⁷ and implies that he bore the surname **Viranârâyaṇa.⁸** In the Sanskṛit portion of the same grant, the two names Vîranârâyaṇa⁹ and **Parântaka¹⁰** are used for the **Chôḷa** king. In the large Leyden grant the name Parântaka alone appears.¹¹ In both of these copper-plate grants, he is said to have been the son of the Chôḷa king **Âditya (I.)** and the grandson of **Vijayâlaya.** From the Udayêndiram plates we learn that he uprooted the **Bâṇa** king¹² and gave the Bâṇa territory to his **Gaṅga** feudatory **Pṛithivîpati II.¹³** He conquered the **Pâṇḍya king\|Râjasiṁha¹⁴** and defeated the army of the king of **Ceylon.¹⁵** This event appears to be referred to in the *Mahâvaṁsa*¹⁶ when it says that the Singhalese king **Kassapa V.** sent an army to aid the Pâṇḍya king against the Chôḷa, but that the expedition was not successful. Kassapa V. is supposed to have reigned from A.D. 929 to 939.¹⁷ If the chronology of this portion of the *Mahâvaṁsa* can be relied upon,¹⁸ we can get to a nearer approximation with regard to the date of Parântaka I. than what is furnished by the Âtakûr inscription, from which it appears that this king’s eldest son **Râjâditya** had been killed before A.D. 950. In the verse which refers to Parântaka I. the *Kaliṅgattu-Paraṇi* mentions the conquest of **Ceylon and Madhurâ.¹⁹** The large Leyden grant says that Parântaka I. covered with gold the Śiva temple at **Vyâghrâgrahâra,²⁰** which is a Sanskṛit rendering of Puliyûr, one of the Tamil names of **Chidambaram.** This evidently means that he built the so-called **Kanakasabhâ** or Golden Hall at Chidambaram. In the collection of Śaiva hymns known as *Tiruviśaippâ,* there is a poem composed by **Kaṇḍarâdittar,**
