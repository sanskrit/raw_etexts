**POSTSCRIPT.**

......I avail myself of this opportunity for correcting a mistake in my edition of the **Êkâmranâtha** inscription of **Gaṇapati.** In line 11 of this inscription (*Ind. Ant*. Vol. XXI. p. 201), write ![](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/epigraphica_indica/vol3/images/787.bmp) : as *one* word, and add a footnote : “Read ![](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/epigraphica_indica/vol3/images/788.bmp).” In the translation of verse 15 (*ibid* . p. 202), read ; “who the best of the smooth gems of the Tâmraparṇî (*which was his mother*) **Vâchâmbâ.**” That Vâchâmbâ was the mother of Gaṇapati’s minister **Sâmanta-Bhôja,** and that **Dôchi,** who is referred to in verses 15 to 17 of the **Êkâmranâtha** inscription, was his father, follows from the subjoined short Grantha inscription² on a stone in front of the Maṇikaṇṭêśvara shrine at **Kâḷahasti** in the North Arcot district.
