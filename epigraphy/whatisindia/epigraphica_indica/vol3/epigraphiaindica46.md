**No. 7.— MANDHATA PLATES OF JAYASIMHA OF DHARA.  
  
\[VIKRAMA-\] SAMVAT 1112.  
  
BY F. KIELHORN, PH.D., C.I.E. ; GÃ–TTINGEN.**

......I edit this inscription from excellent impression, prepared by Mr. Cousens, Superintendent of the Archæological Survey of Western India, and sent to me by Dr. Hultzsch. The original plates are at **Mândhâtâ,** an island in the **Narmadâ** river, attached to the **Nimâr** district of the Central Provinces.⁴

......**The copper-plates,** which are inscribed on one side only, are two in number, each measuring about 13¼’’ broad by 10’’ high. They are in a state of perfect preservation, so that the reading of the text, with perhaps the exception of a single *akshara,*⁵ is nowhere doubtful. Each plate contains fifteen lines of writing. The letters are boldly and regularly drawn and well engraved. In the lower part of the first plate, and the upper part of the second, there are holes for two rings. These rings had both been cut when the impressions were taken, and the seal which may have been on one of them, was not forthcoming. In the lower proper right corner of the second plate, however, there is a representation of **Garuḍa,** about 2½’’ high by 2¾’’ broad, with the body of a man and the head of a bird, facing the left, and looking at a serpent which is held by his left hand.⁶ The average size of the letters is about 7/16’’. **The characters** are Nâgarî, and **the language** is Sanskṛit. About twelve lines of the inscription (lines 1-2, 10-12, 22-28) are in verse ; The rest is in prose. As regards **orthography,** the letter *b* is throughout denoted by the sign for *v* ; the dental sibilant is used instead of the palatal in *sirasâ*, line 1, *vinasvaraṁ*, line 12, and *samêtas=cha* and *Amarêśvarê*, line 14, and the palatal instead of the dental in *śâśanêna*, line 17 ; the guttural nasal is employed instead of the *anusvâra* in the name *Jayasiṅha*, in lines 15 and 30 ; and the same name apparently is written *Jayasiṅgha* in line 6. Besides, it may be noted that the sign of the *avagraha* occurs twice, in *ºvṛiddhayê dṛishṭaº* in line 16, and vuddhvâ *smad*º in line 20.

......**The inscription** is one of the *Paramabhṭṭâraka Mahârâjâdhirâja Paramêśvara,* the illustrious **Jayasiṁhadêva,** who meditated on the feet of the *P. M. P.,* the illustrious **Bhôjadêva,** who, again, had meditated on the feet of the *P. M. P.,* the illustrious **Sindhurâjadêva,** who had meditated on the feet of the *P. M. P.,* the illustrious **Vâkpatirâjadêva** (lines 3-6) ; and
