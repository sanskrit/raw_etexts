****SITUBALDI INSCRIPTION OF VIKRAMADITYA VI.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

ornament of the **Châlukyas,** *i.e.* the king Vikramâditya VI. of the Western Châlukya dynasty.¹ It then mentions (in lines 4-7), as a dependent of the king *Mahâsâmanta*² **Dhâḍîbha\[ṁ\]ḍaka,** also called the *Rêṇaka* **Dhâḍiadêva,** who had emigrated from **Latalaura,** was born in the **Mahârâshṭrakûṭa** lineage, and was distinguished by such titles as ‘the scattcrer of hostile armies, in war a Sahasrabâhu,³ a uterine brother of others’ wives, the wrestler of all wrestlers, he who obtained favour by a boon of (the goddess) Châmuṇḍâ.’ And in ines 7-10 the inscription records that a dependent of this Dhâḍiadêva, the *Daṇḍanâyaka*⁴ Vâsudêva, a son of the *bhaṭṭa* Padmanâbha, grandson of the *bhaṭṭa* \[Bô\]papai and great-grandson of the *bhaṭṭa* Vîṭhapai, who belonged to the Kâṇva *śâkhâ* and Vatsa *gôtra* and had five *pravaras,* and who also had emigrated from **Latalaura,** ‘a slave to cows Brâhmaṇas’ and ardent worshipper of the god Vishṇu,⁵ who had obtained favour by a boon of (the god) Nârasiṁha (Vishṇu), gave 12 *nivartanas* of land, which had been purchased by him, for the grazing of cattle ; also 7 *nivartanas* for daily food given to cattle ; and 5 *nivartanas* for *vâhaka* (?),⁶ apparently to a temple at which the inscription was put up. The concluding line 11 sates that, whosoever appropriates the land so given, robs the gods Brahman, Vishṇu and Mahêśvara (Śiva) ; and that, who steals the cows from it, falls into hell.

......The inscription is **dated,** in lines 1-2, in **Śaka-Saṁat 1008, on Friday, the lunar day of the bright half of Vaiśâkha of the year Prabhava.** By the southern luni-solar system the year Prabhava would be Śaka-Saṁvat 1009, not 1008, expired ; but the date does not **work out satisfactorily** for either year, nor fpr the four surrounding years. For the third *tithi* of the bright half of Vaiśâkha ended,â€”

in Śaka-Saṁvat 1006 expired, on Thursday, 11th April, A. D. 1084 ;  
“ “ “ 1007 expired, on Monday, 31st March, A. D. 1085 ;  
“ “ “ 1008 expired, on Sunday, 19th April, A. D. 1086 ;  
“ “ “ **1009 expired, on Thursday,⁷ 8th April, A. D. 1087 ;**  
“ “ “ 1010 expired, on Tuesday, 25th March, A. D. 1088 ; and Wednesday, 26th April, A. D. 1088 ;  
“ “ “ 1011 expired, on Monday, 16th April, A. D. 1089 ;

......In my opinion, the day intended by the dae is really Thursday, the 8th April, A. D. 1087, and the writer made a mistake in regard to the week-day.

......The place **Latalaura,** which is twice mentioned in this inscription, I am unable to identify,

......² *i.e.* ‘the great feudatory.’  
......³ *i.e.* Arjuna.  
......⁴ *i.e.* ‘one who applies the rod,’ a head police-officer, *etc*.  
......⁵ The exact sence of the word *ubhayadvâda*\[*sô*\]*dhavalu* of the text is not apparent.  
......⁶ About the meaning of the word *vâhaka* also I am doubtful ; perhaps it denotes here the drivers or attendants of the cattle.  
......⁷ On this day the third *tithi* of the bright half ended 16 h. 9 m. after mean sunrise.

......¹⁰ The date would have been correctly expressed thus : *Śakanṛipa-kṛl-âtîla-saṁvatsara-śatêshu daśasv=ashṭ-âdhikêshu yatr=âṅkatô= pi Śakê 1008 Prabhava-saṁvatsar-ântargata-Vaiśâkha-śuddha-tṛitiyâ-Śukradinê.  * ......¹¹ The *aksharas lâ* and *ta,* having been originally omitted, are engraved above the line.  
......¹² This may possibly have been altered to *ashṭâdhikê.*  
......¹³ Here and in other places below, which it is unneccssary to point out separately, the rules of *saṁdhi* have not been observed.
