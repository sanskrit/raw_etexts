****UDAYENDIRAM PLATES OF NANDIVARMAN.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

......**The inscription** professes to be one of the devout worshipper of Bhagavat (Vishṇu), the law-abiding *Mahârâja* of the **Pallavas,** the illustrious **Nandivarman** (l. 10), a member of the Bhâradvâja *gôtra*, who is described as the son of the *Mahârâja* **Skandavarman** (l. 6), the son’s son of the *Mahârâja* **Siṁhavarman** (l. 4), and the great-grandson of the *Râjâ* **Skandavarman**¹ (l. 2). It informs us (in ll. 11-14) that, form the victorious **Kâñchîpura** (l. 1.), Nandivarman gave the village of **Kâñchivâyil** and four pieces of forest-land, situated in the district (*râshṭra*) of **Aḍêyâra,** to a Brâhmaṇa inhabitant of Kâñchivâyil, named **Kuḷaśarman,** who belonged to the Kauśika *gôtra* and to the Vêdic school of the Taittirîyas, and whose *sûtra* was the Pravachana.² The inscription further (in ll. 15-18) contains an admonition not to levy taxes on the land so granted, threatens with corporal punishment those who should transgress the king’s commands, and cities two of the ordinary imprecatory verses ; and it closes (in l. 19) with the statement that this documents (*paṭṭikâ*) was issued **on the fifth (lunar day) of the bright half of Vaiśâkha, in the first year of the victorious reign** (apparently of Nandivarman).

......**The Tamil endorsement** on plate i.*a* runs thus :— “In the twenty-sixth year (*of the reign*) of **Madirai-koṇḍa Kô-Parakêsarivarman,³—** we, (*the members of*) the assembly of **Kâñchivâyil**, *alias* **Iganmaraimaṅgalam,** and we, (*the members of* ) the assembly of **Udayachandramaṅgalam,** (*have agreed as follows*) :— We, (*the inhabitants of* ) these two villages, having joined (*and*) having become one, shall prosper as one village from this (*date*).”

......Without the endorsement, this inscription is very similar to the Uruvupalli grant of the Pallava *Yuvamahârâja* Vishṇugôpavarman, published by Dr. Fleet in the *Indian Antiquary,* Vol. V. pp. 50 ff. Indeed, but for the circumstance that our grant was issued ( not from Palakkada, but) from Kâñchîpura, and that the rulers mentioned in it are Skandavarman, Siṁhavarman, Skandavarman, and Nandivarman (instead of Skandavarman, Vîravarman, Skandavarman, and Vishṇugôpavarman), lines 1-10 of it read much like a mutilated copy lines 1-16 of the Uruvupalli grant ; and in a similar, though perhaps less striking manner,⁴ lines 15-18 of Nandivarman’s grant may be said to resemble lines 28-32 of the grant of Vishṇugôpavarman. This fact has not escaped the Rev. T. Foulkes, and the conclusion which he has felt inclined to draw from it, apparently is, that both grants were issued by the same prince, and that, accordingly, the Vîravarman and Vishṇugôpavarman⁵ of the one grant are identical with the Siṁhavarman and Nandivarman of the other. I myself am of opinion that the present inscription must, on palæographical grounds, be assigned to a later period than the Uruvupalli grant ; and, considering it suspicious that, at different periods, there should have been two Pallava princes whose fathers and great-grandfathers were called Skandavarman, and that, moreover, two sets of four consecutive princes should have been described in almost identical terms, and taking also into account the extreme slovenliness of the wording of Nandivarman’s grant, I cannot suppress the belief that this grant may be a spurious documents,⁶ the writer of which took for his model either the Uruvupalli grant of Vishṇugôpavarman itself or some other inscription of the same prince.

......The Tamil endorsement of this inscription is practically identical with the endorsement at the end of the grant of Nandivarman Pallavamalla, published by the Rev. T. Foulkes in the *Indian*

......¹ For a translation of the various epithets applied to these kings, which for the historian are quite worthless, see *Ind. Ant.* Vol. V. p. 52.  
......² The expression *Pravachana-sûtra* occurs seven times in the description of the donees in the grant of Nandivarman Pallavamalla (*Ind. Ant.* Vol. VIII. pp. 276 and 277). I do not know what particular *sûtra* is referred to by it.  
......³ See *South-Indian Inscriptions,* Vol. I. p. 112.  
......⁴ Compare also lines 29-35 of the grant of Siṁhavarman in *Ind. Ant.* Vol. V. p. 156.  
......⁵ Or the Siṁhavarman, during whose reign the grant of Vishṇugôpavarman was issued.  
......⁶ Compare also Dr. Fleet’s remarks in *Ind. And.* Vol. IX. p. 101, and Vol. XV. p. 274.
