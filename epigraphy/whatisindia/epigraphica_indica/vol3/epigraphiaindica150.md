****UNAMANJERI PLATES OF ACHYUTARAYA.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

......To proceed with our analysis of the inscription, the village of Uhinai (or rather the income from it), according to verse 54, (ll. 115-117), was divided into 60 *vṛittis*, or shares.¹ Of these, one *vṛitti* and a quarter were set aside for the benefit of the god **Raghunâtha** (Vishṇu) ; and the same amount was reserved for the worship of the god **Chaṇḍîśvara** (Śiva ; vv. 55 and 56).² The bulk was distributed, in amounts ranging from a quarter of a *vṛitti* to five *vṛittis,* among forty-eight Brâhmaṇas who are named in the verses 57-104 (ll. 120-179). Each of these verses³ gives, in addition to the exact amount allotted to each person, also the name of the father of the recipient, and specifies the *gôtra* or *anvaya* of the latter, and the Vêdic texts studied by him. The names of the donees and their fathers’ names which occur in vv. 57-104, arranged in alphabetical order, are the following :—

......The *gôtras* or, as they are here commonly called, *anvayas* of the donees were those of **Kâśyapa,** vv. 57, 60, 75 ; Kauśika, vv. 82, 83, 85, 88 ; Gautama, v. 74 ; Bhâradvâja, vv. 59, 61, 62, 65, 69, 76, 79-81, 84, 86, 87, 89-94, 96, 98, 99 ; Maudagalya, v. 63 ; Maunabhârgava, vv. 58, 102 ; Vatsa, vv. 66, 97 ; Vasishṭha, v. 72 ; Viśvâmitra, vv. 64, 67, 68, 70, 71, 95 ; Saṁkṛiti, v. 77 ; Sâvarṇa, v. 104 ; and Harita, vv.73, 100, 101, 103.

......Twenty-one donees were students of the Ṛigvênda (*bahvṛicha*), eighteen students of the Yajurvêda (*yâjusha*), and one (in v. 104) was a student of the Sâmavêda (*sâmaga*). Six Followed⁵ the *sûtra* of Drâhyâyaṇa, and one (in v. 103) that of Âpastamba.

......After having enumerated the donees, our inscription, in verses 105-108 (ll. 180-185), further states that the Brâhmaṇas, to whom the sixty *vṛittis* had thus been assigned in the village, made up thirty additional *vṛittis*⁶ and gave these, as a preferential share, to the  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

......¹ The sum of the *vṛittis*, specified in vv. 55-104, actually is 60¾.  
......² Raghunâtha and Chaṇḍîśvara were evidently the names of the temples of Perumâḷ (Vishṇu) and Îśvara (Śiva) at Uhinai (Ûnamâñjêri).  
......³ Verse 78 (in ll. 149-150) is mutilated.  
......⁴ These two names are derived from Vêṅgaḍam, the Tamiḷ name of the holy mountain near Tirupati in the North Arcot district.  
......⁵ The original text somewhat oddly says were ‘born of the *sûtra* of Drâhyâyaṇa (or Âpastamba) ; see vv. 85-87, 89, 96, and 103.  
......⁶ It is not quite clear to me whether these thirty *vṛittis* were taken from the portions which, according to what preceeds, had been assigned to the Brâhmaṇas, or whether the village of Uhinai had originally been divided into ninety *vṛittis*, of which the aforesaid donees at once set thirty aside for the minister. The former arrangement appears to me to be the one which is indicated by the wording of the text.
