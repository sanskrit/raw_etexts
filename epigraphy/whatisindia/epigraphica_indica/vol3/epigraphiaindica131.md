****CHICACOLE PLATES OF DEVENDRAVARMAN.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

......The plates record the grant of the village of **Poppaṅgika in Saraümaṭamba,** a subdivision of the district of **Krôshṭukavartanî** (l. 9), as an *agrahâra* (l. 10) to six Brâhmaṇa brothers, who resided at **Kaliṅgânagara** (l. 11) and belonged to the Chhandôga school (l. 12). The grant was made at **Kaliṅganagara¹** (l. 2) by one of the kings of **Kaliṅga** (l. 5) of the **Gâṅga** family (l. 4),― the *Mahârâja* **Dêvêndravarman,** who was the son of **Guṇârṇava** (l. 8). The date of the grant was the **eighth** *tithi* of the **bright** fortnight of the month of **Mâgha** (l. 11), during (*the sun’s*) **progress to the north** (*udag-ayana*).² The edict itself was engrossed and issued in **“the one-hundred-and-eighty-third year** (in words and numerical symbols) **of the reign, on the twentieth** (*solar*) **day** (in words and figures) **of the month of Śrâvaṇa”** (l. 26 f.). This second date is subsequent to the first by at least several months. Unfortunately, neither of the two dates contains any elements which admit of verification, and which might thus help to fix the initial point of the Gâṅga era. The second date is preceded by the names of the writer of the edict and of an official witness (l. 24 f.), and followed by the name of the engraver (l. 27).

......Owing to the uncertainty in which the Gâṅga era is still involved, nothing can at present be said about Dêvêndravarman, the son of Guṇârnava, but that he must be distinct from Dêvêndravarman, the son Anantavarman,³ and that the name **Guṇârṇava** occurs twice in the list of the ancestors of Chôḍagaṅga of Kalinga.⁴

......¹ The vowel of the third syllable is short here, as in the majority of other instances, while it is long in line 11, in the Chicacole plates of Anantavarman’s son Dêvêndravarman (*Ind. Ant.* Vol. XIII. p. 275, text line 2), in the Alamanda plates (*ante,* p. 18, text line 2), and in the Parlâ-Kimeḍi plates of Vajrahasta, which will shortly be published by Professor Kielhorn (No. 31 below).  
......² Compare the first date of the Achyutapuram plates, *ante,* p. 127. In the Chicacole plates, *udagayana* cannot be taken in the sense of *uttarâyaṇa-saṁkrânti,* because the latter cannot coincide with the eighth *tithi* of the bright fortnight of Mâgha.  
......³ *Ind. Ant.* Vol. XIII. p. 273, and Vol. XVIII. p. 146.  
......⁴ *ibid.* Vol. XVIII. p. 170 f.  
......⁵ From the original plates.

......¹⁰ As in another Gâṅga (*Ind. Ant.* Vol. XIII. p. 121), the participle ![](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/epigraphica_indica/vol3/images/130.bmp) is erroneously placed at the beginning of the compound, while the same sense requires it to stand between ![](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/epigraphica_indica/vol3/images/132.bmp):, as in two other grants (*Ind. Ant.* Vol. XVI. p. 134, and *ante,* p. 128).
