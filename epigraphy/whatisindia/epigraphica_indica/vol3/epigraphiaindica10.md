****RANGANATHA INSCRIPTION OF SUNDARA-PANDYA.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

No. II.— *Inscription on the west wall of the second prâkâra of the Jambukêśvara temple at Śrîraṅgam.*

......Pôśaḷa-śrî-Vîra-Râmanâthadêvarku yâṇḍu \[7vadu\] Dhanu-nâyarru apara-pakshattu shashṭhiyum Budhan-kilamaiyum perra \[Pûra\]ttu nâḷ.

......“The day of Pûrva-Phalgunî,¹ which corresponded to Wednesday, the sixth *tithi* of the second half of the month of Dhanus in the \[7th\] year (*of the reign*) of the **Poysaḷa śrî-Vîra-Râmanâthadêva.**”

No. III.— *Inscription on the south wall of the second prâkâra of the Raṅganâtha temple.*

......Hoyisaḷa-śrî-Vîra-Râmanâthadêvarku yâṇḍu padinaiñjâvadu Mina-nâyarru pûrvva-pakshattu prathamaiyum Tiṅgaḷ-kilamaiyum perra Aśvati-nâḷ.

......“The day of Aśvinî, which corresponded to Monday, the first *tithi* of the first half of the month of Mîna in the fifteenth year (*of the reign*) of the **Hoysaḷa śrî-Vîra-Râmanâthadêva.**”

No. IV.— *Inscription in the south-west corner of the third prâkâra of the same temple.*

......Pôśaḷa-śrî-Vîra-Râmanâthadêvarku yâṇḍu padinaiñjâvadu Mithuna-nâyarru apara-pakshattu êkâdaśiyum Nâyarru-kkilamaiyum perra Bharaṇi-nâḷ.

......“The day of Bharaṇî, which corresponded to Sunday, the eleventh *tithi* of the second half of the month of Mithuna in the fifteenth year (*of the reign*) of **the Poysaḷa śrî-Vîra-Râmanâthadêva.**”

No. V.— *Inscription on the south wall of the Poysaḷêśvara temple at Kaṇṇanûr.*

......Padinêlâvadu Âḍi-mâdam irubattu-nâlân=tiyadiy=âna Prajâpati-saṁvarsarada² Śrâvaṇa-śuddha-trayôdaśi Maṅgalavâram.

......“Tuesday, the thirteenth *tithi* of the bright half of Śrâvaṇa in the **Prajâpati** year, which corresponded to the twenty-fourth solar day of the month of Âḍi of the seventeenth (*year of the reign*).”

......The above five dates can be easily calculated by an expert, because we known, from the inscription of Ponnambaladêvâ, that Râmanâtha was a son of Sômêśvara. Hence the only possible Prajâpati year in date No. V. is Śaka-Saṁvat 1194. As this was also the 17th year of Râmanâtha’s reign, the dates of Nos. III. and IV. will fall in Śaka-Saṁvat 1192 ; the date of No. II. in Śaka-Saṁvat 1184 ; the date of No. I. in Śaka-Saṁvat 1179 ; and his accession to the throne in Śaka-Saṁvat 1177.³ It further follows that the defeat and death of Sômêśvara and the coronation of Narasṁiha III. at Dvârasamudra probably took place in the same Śaka year, 1177. The earliest known inscription of **Narasiṁha III**. is actually dated in this year.⁴ From an inscription, which is dated in the 29th year or the reign of **Vîra-Sômêśvaradêva,** at **Tiruvâśi** near Śrîraṅgam, it follows that the accession of Sômêśvara took place between Śaka-Saṁvat 1146, the date of his predecessor Narasiṁha II., and Śaka-Saṁvat 1177 – 29 =

......¹ The name of the *nakshatra* is obliterated and may be Pûśam (Pushya), instead of Pûrva-Phalgunî).  
......² This is a Kanarese genitive in the middle of a Tamil date.  
......³ Since this was written, Mr. S. B. Dikshit has very kindly calculated the five dates and informed me that No. I. is the 24th January, A.D. 1257 ; No. II. the 14th December, A.D. 1261 ; No. III. the 24th March, A.D. 1270 , No. IV. the 15th June, A.D. 1272 ; No. V. the 21st July, A.D. 1271 ; and that it follows from the two last dates that Râmanâtha ascended the throne between the 16th June and the 20th July, A.D. 1255.
