has been preached :― “Both small men and great men shall exert themselves to this (*end*),”\[8\] and even my neighbours \[9\] shall know it, and this exertion shall be of long duration. And this matter will grow, and it will even grow largely, at the least it will grow one size and a half. And this sermon has been preached **by the Departed, 256** \[10\] (*years ago*).”

***Second Edict.***

......“Even thus \[11\] speaks the **Beloved of the gods :―** Obedience should be rendered to mother and father. Moreover, the respect for living creatures should be made firm,\[12\] the truth should be spoken. Even these virtues prescribed by the sacred law should be practised. Moreover, the pupil should honour his teacher, and towards blood-relations one should indeed \[13\] behave as is due to them. This is the ancient standard (*of virtuous conduct*), \[14\] this conduces to long life,\[15\] and this should thus be performed.”

......Written by **Paḍa** the scribe.

**REMARKS.**

......1. Possibly the termination *te* (*tas*) has here the sense of the locative, in accordance with the maxim of the Sanskṛit grammarians, declaring the affix *tasi* may serve to express any case-relation. If so, the translation has to be altered slightly. In addition to the parallel passages mentioned by Mr. Rice and M. Senart, the second line of the Nâsik inscription No. XI. B (*Rep. Arch. Surv. West. India,* p. 106) ought to be compared, where we read :― *raño Gotamîputasa Sâtakaṇisa mahâdeviya cha jîvasutâtuya râjamâtuya vachanena Govadhane Sâmako âroga vatavo tato eva vatavo.* Regarding the meaning of *ayaputa* see the introductory remarks.

......2. The second version has :― “The Beloved of the gods speaks thus.”

......3. *Aḍhatiya* is, in Sanskṛit, not *ardhatṛitîya*, as Mr. Childers asserts, but *ardhatraya.*

......4. *Savachhara* or *saṁvachhara* would have to be translated by ‘*a year*,’ but for the *variæ lectiones* of Sahasrâm,― *saḍvachhale* (formerly misread *saviṁchhale*), and of Rûpnâth, *chhavachhare*, which both correspond to the Sanskṛit *shaḍvatsaram.* Instead of *saḍ* (compare also *saḍuvîsati*, Pillar-Edicts I-VI.), *sa* or *saṁ* may, of course, be used, the following consonant being doubled ; compare *sapanâla* in the Sahasrâm Edict, and *â-saṁ-mâsike,* Pillar-Edict V.

......5. *Upayîte, upayite,* or *up . te,* i.e. *upêtaḥ*, is the reading of all the versions. *Up . te* is plain in the facsimile of the Rûpnâth version, where formerly I read wrongly *papite*. As Aśôka contrasts here the period *yaṁ mayâ saṁghe upayîte* with that when he was *upâsake*, ‘a lay- worshipper,’ it appears that the phrase means that he had entered Saṁgha, and had become, at least nominally, a monk ; compare the Sanskṛit phrases *yajñam, vratam,* or *brahmacharyam upa-i.* The Sanskṛit translation of the passage is : *yan mayâ saṁgha upêtô bâḍhaṁ cha mayâ prakrântam.* The prothesis of *y* in *yîta* for *îta, i.e. ita,* may be compared with that of *v* before *u* in *vuchchati, vutta* (*upta*), and so forth. It is common before *ê* in Marâṭhî words, *e.g. yêk* for *êka, yêraṇḍa for êraṇḍa,* etc.

......6. I do not think it either permissible or necessary to change, as M. Senart does, the word *devehi,* which occurs in two versions ; for the passage gives a good sense if *devehi* is taken as equivalent to *dêvaiḥ saha,* as certainly may be done. With this explanation, the transliteration into Sanskṛit would beֹ : *Êtêna tu kâlênâmṛishâ santô manushyâ mṛishâ* \[*kṛitâḥ*\] *dêvaiḥ* \[*saha*\]. The general meaning is that those men who were considered to be true, *i.e.* true prophets and instructors, like the ascetics and Brâhmaṇas teaching the Vaishṇavas, Śaivas, and other sects, were deprived of their high position by the efforts of Aśôka and lost the confidence of the people, and that their gods fell with them. The Rûpnâth Edict says, l. 2 :― *Yi imâya kâlâya Jaṁbudipasi amisâ dêva husu te dâni masâ kaṭâ,* and distinctly asserts the overthrow of the Brâhmaṇical deities. Here we have the very natural assertion that the prophets and teachers fell in the estimation of the people together with their gods. The question whether the Sahasrâm
