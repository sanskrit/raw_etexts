****RAJOR INSCRIPTION OF MATHANADEVA.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**No. 36.─ RAJOR INSCRIPTION OF MATHANADEVA ;  
  
\[VIKRAMA-\]SAMVAT 1016.  
  
BY F. KIELHORN, PH.D., LL.D., C.I.E. ; GÖTTINGEN.**

......The stone which bears this inscription was found, about eighteen years ago, near the temple of Nîlakaṇṭha Mahâdêva, among the ruins of the city of Pâranagar which are to the south of the village of **Râjôr** or **Râjôrgaḍh,** on a lofty range of hills in the Râjgaḍh district of the **Alwar State** in Râjputâna, about 28 miles south-west of the town of Alwar ;¹ and it is now preserved at Alwar itself. The inscription was first published by the late Dr. Rajendralal Mitra, in the *Proceedings of the Bengal Asiatic Society,* 1879, p. 157 ff., from a transcript prepared by Paṇḍit Bhavânanda and his brothers, of Alwar ; and it has again been printed in the *Prâchînalêkhamâlâ* of the *Kâvyamâlâ,* Vol. I. p. 53 ff., from another copy supplied by the same gentlemen. I now re-edit the inscription from rubbings which have been procured for me by Dr. Fleet.

......The inscription contains 23 lines of writing which covers a space of about 1’ 5” broad by 1’ 3¼” high, and is nearly throughout in a perfect state of preservation. The average **size of the letters** is about ½”.² The **characters** are Nâgarî ; they closely resemble those of the Harsha inscription of Vigraharâja, published with a photo-lithograph in the *Epigraphia Indica,* Vol. II. p. 116 ff. The **language** is Sanskṛit, and, excepting four benedictive and imprecatory verse, here ascribed to Vyâsa, in lines 18-20, and another verse in line 21, which gives the names of the composer, the writer and the engraver, the text is in prose. The inscription has been written and engraved very carefully. In respect of **orthography,** I need only note the employment of the letter *v* for both *v* and *b,* the doubling of *t* and *d* in the conjuncts *tr* and *dr,* and the occasional use of the sign of *avagraha.* As regards lexicography, lines 11-12 contain a number of revenue-terms, the exact import of which is not apparent, and some other words of unknown or doubtful meaning (*pravaṇi, tatti, chôllikâ,* etc.) occur in lines 6, 16 and 17, and 22 and 23.

......The inscription (in lines 1-3) refers itself to the reign of the *Paramabhaṭṭâraka Mahârâjâdhirâja Paramêśvara,* the illustrious **Vijayapâladêva,** who meditated on the feet of the *Paramabhaṭṭâraka Mahârâjâdhirâja Paramêśvara,* the illustrious **Kshitipâladêva ;** and is dated, in words and figures, on **Saturday, the 13th of the bright half Mâgha of the year 1016.** On this day the *Mahârâjâdhirâja Paramêśvara,* the illustrious **Mathanadêva,** of the **Gurjarapratîhâra** lineage, and a son of the *Mahârâjâdhirâja,* the illustrious **Sâvaṭa,** residing at **Râjyapura,** (in lines 3-13) informs his officials, the *gamâgamikas*³ and others, and the *mahattaras, mahhattamas,* merchants, *pravaṇis*⁴ and other inhabitants of the village of **Vyâghrapâṭaka,** pertaining to the **Vaṁśapôtaka** *bhôga* which Mathadadêva held possession of, that on the occasion of the installation (of the image, or the consecration of the temple) of the god Lachchhukêśvara Mahâdêva (Śiva), so named after his mother **Lachchhukâ,** he has granted to the god (or his temple) the village of **Vyâghrapâṭaka,─** ‘up to its proper boundaries,

......¹ See Sir A. Cunningham’s *Archæol. Survey of India,* Vol. XX. pp. 124-126. I have no doubt that Major Powlett rightly believed Râjôr or Râjôrgaḍh (*i.e.* Râjyapura) to be the old name of Pâranagar ; and it seems to me highly probable that ‘the holy temple of Nîlakaṇṭha Mahâdêva, which is the most famous place of pilgrimage in this part of the country,’ and which Sir A. Cunningham has assigned to the 10th century A.D., is the very temple that is referred to in the inscription here edited.  
......² The concluding word *śrî-Mathanaḥ* is in somewhat larger characters.  
......³ Compare, *e.g., Ind. Ant.* Vol. XV. p. 306, l. 35 ; Vol. XVII. p. 11. l. 14.  
......⁴ I am unable to explain this word, but would compare with *vaṇik-pravaṇi-pramukha* the expression, *vaṇik- śrêshṭhi-purôga,* which is met with elsewhere. *Pravaṇi* occurs in *pravaṇi-kara,* the meaning of which also is not apparent ; compare *Ind. Ant.* Vol. XV. p. 10, note 58.
