Close to the left of ![](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/epigraphica_indica/vol3/images/208.bmp) and below the line there seems to be an indistinct symbol which may be read as![](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/epigraphica_indica/vol3/images/209.bmp)

......⁵ The engraver has entered only the *ê* of *tê* and omitted the symbol *t.*  
......⁶ Read ![](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/epigraphica_indica/vol3/images/212.bmp) ; the engraver has, by mistake, written an *â* instead of the second *t* of the group *tta,* and the symbol should, strictly speaking, be transcribed as ![](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/epigraphica_indica/vol3/images/213.bmp)  
......⁷ Read ![](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/epigraphica_indica/vol3/images/214.bmp) ; the engraver has here repeated the mistake mentioned in the preceding note, and thus, though he meant *dattam,* has put down *datâm.*

......¹⁰ In Kanarese characters.  
......¹¹ *Śaṁkarasakha* is synonymous with *śivapriya,* which, according to the Sanskṛit dictionaries, means ‘a crystal.’ According to the Tamil dictionaries, *śivan* is used in the sense of ‘cat’s-eye.â€™
