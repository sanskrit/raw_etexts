------------------------------------------------------------------------

......(V. 10.) In consequence of (*his*) numerous good deeds (*in former births*), this glorious king Saṁgama begat a son, the glorious king **Vîra-Bhu\[k\]ka,** who was an auspicious mirror to the goddess of heroes.¹

......(V. 11.) People identify this king **Bhukka** with Śiva, devoid of terrible surnames, as he is slow of fire (*i.e.* anger) (*and*) not surrounded by dissolute friends (*bhujaṁga*), \[while Śiva is quick of fire and adorned with serpents (*bhujaṁga*)\].

......(V. 12.) The sporting goddess of his fame (*had*) the mundane egg for a jewelled hall, the Moon for a parasol (*set with*) pearls, and Venus and the Sun for a (*double*) lamp.

......(V. 13.) While that glorious king **Vîra-Bhukka** was righteously protecting the earth, the people, unafflicted by calamities, were continually enjoying festivals.

......(V. 14.) From this great lord (*mahêśvara*), who was the husband of **Gaurî,** was born the lord **Harihara,** a king who was renowned by (*his*) power (*śakti*), (*and*) who was a partial incarnation of Skanda.²

......(V. 15.) While this (*king*) was engaged in upholding the observances of all the castes and orders, the earth up to the four oceans became the celestial cow (*in fulfilling all desires*).

......(V. 16.) The ten directions are illumined by the fame of him who is seated on the throne, as by the light of the full-moon who is standing over the eastern mountain.

......(V. 17.) Having taken away the wealth of rival kings (*as suddenly*) as a falling thunderbolt, (*he*) performed the sixteen great gifts, *viz.* the gift of his weight (*in gold*), etc.
