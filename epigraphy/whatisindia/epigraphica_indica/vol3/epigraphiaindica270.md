****BHADANA GRANT OF APARAJITA.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

hands of the superintending people of the town of **Guṇapura (?),** the merchants Ambû-śrêshṭhin and Vâppaiya-śrêshṭhin, the priest (*bhôjaka*) Chêlappaiyu, the Brâhmaṇa Gôvaniya, and others, and having worshipped with pure faith Hari (Vishṅu), Hara (Śiva), Hiraṇyagarbha (Brahman), Agni, and other gods,— gave the village of **Bhâdâna,** in the **Mâhirihâra** *vishaya* of **Koṅkaṇa** which contains 1,400 villages, . . . . . to (the temple of) the illuminator of the three worlds, the holy god **Lôṇâditya at Lavaṇêtaṭa,** for the purpose of providing flowers, perfumes, lights, offerings of estables, public shows, *etc.,* and for keeping the doors and other parts (of the temple) in proper repair.â€™

......The village of **Bhâdâna,** so granted, (according to lines 57-62) was bounded on the north by a *bhinnâra* (?) field of the village of **Paḍigaha,** on the west by (the village of) **Âsachchhadî,** on the south by the great river **Murula,** and on the east by the river **Kumbhârî ;** and was given with its rows of trees, up to its proper boundaries, with the *udraṅga* and *parikara,*¹ with the exception of what had been previously given to gods and Brâhmaṇas, but together with (the fines imposed for the commission of) certain great and lesser offences,² and with the privilege that it was not be entered by the irregular or regular troops.

......Lines 66-82 contain the usual injunction to preserve this grant intact, threaten with spiritual punishment those who might interfere with its provisions, and quote seven of the ordinary benedictive and imprecatory verses. The inscription then (in line 82) continues thus :— ‘In confirmation of the above, the *Mahâmaṇḍalêśvara,* the glorious **Aparâjitadêvarâja,** has it put down (here) by the writer’s hand that this is his decree, (in the words) “ such is my decree, that of the glorious **Aparâjitadêvarâja,**” (issued) while by the glorious king’s³ appointment the illustrious Saṅgalaiya is *Mahâmâtya*⁴ and the illustrious Sîhappaiya *Mahâsândhivigrahika.*⁵ This charter⁶ has been written at the direction of Saṅgalaiya (?) by his son and deputy Annappaiya. It is deposited at **Sthânaka.** Everything without exception that is written here, be it right or wrong, should be regarded as authoritative.’

......Lines 87-89 then record an additional settlement by which the town (it is not clear which town⁷) was to give every year 260 *drammas,* I do not understand for what exact purpose. And the inscription ends with the words ‘bliss, great fortune.’

......**The date of this inscription is not quite regular.** In Śaka-Saṁvat 919 expired, which by the southern luni-solar system *was* the Jovian year Hêmalamba, the Dakshiṇâyana (Karkaṭa) Saṁkrânti took place 22 h. 13 m. after mean sunrise of the 24th June, A. D. 997, during the second *tithî* of the dark half of the *amânta* Âshâḍha ; and the fourth *tithî* of the dark half of the same Âshâḍha commenced 0 h. 43 m. and ended 21h. 52 m. after mean sunrise of the 26th June, A. D. 997. Judging by a large number of other dates, any rite specially connected with the Saṁkrânti should in this case have been performed on the 25th June, and this day should have been described in the text as the second of the dark half, both because the second *tithi* ended on it, 3 h. 7 m. after mean sunrise, and because the Saṁkrânti took place during that *tithî*. As no week-day is given, it is impossible to say whether **the 25th or the 26th June, A.D. 997,** is the exact day of the grant.

......¹ This word is used here as elsewhere for the more common *uparikara ;* compare, *e.g.,* page 109 above, note 7.  
......² The first half of line 61 pf the text I do not fully understand ; *kumârî-sâhasa* (if this be the correct reading) would of course be ‘ violence offered to a girl.’  
......³ The term of the original (in line 84) is *śrîvi(bi)rudaka-râja,* ‘the king who had *śrî* as the *biruda.*’ Compare the expression *śrîvirudâṁka* (?), used with reference to Aparâjita in *As. Res.* Vol. I. p. 357, last line of the litho- graph, and *Ind. Ant.* Vol. IX. p. 34, l. 33.  
......⁴ *i.e.* ‘great minister.’  
......⁵ *i.e.* ‘great minister for peace and war ;’ a Sîhapaiya is mentioned as minister for peace and war is the Bhâṇḍup grant of Chhittarâjadêva of Śaka-Saṁvat 948, *Ind. Ant.* Vol. V. p. 278.  
......⁶ *i.e.* the original of it, of which the copper-plates furnish a copy.  
......⁷ In all probability it was Guṇapura.
