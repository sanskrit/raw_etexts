****PAITHAN PLATES OF GOVINDA III.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

......(V. 24.) To this (*temple of*) Śaṁbhu, (*called*) **Gaṇapêśa,** the great queen granted for (*its*) requirements the village named **Chintapâḍu.**

......(V. 25.) She whose hands are exclusively engaged in worshipping Hara (Śiva), whose eyes and ears are always attached to the festivals and excellent concerts which (*she*) causes to be performed daily (*in honour*) of Śaṁbhu, who thus joyfully passes (*her*) days though standing (*at the head*) of a great kingdom, (*and who is*), therefore, verily (*identical with*) the mountain- daughter,— who is praise that **Gaṇapâmbikâ** (*appropriately*) ?

**No. 17.─ PAITHAN PLATES OF GOVINDA III.  
  
SAKA-SAMVAT 716.  
  
BY F. KIELHORN, PH. D., C.I.E. ; GÖTTINGEN.**

......This record is now brought to notice for the first time. I edit it from excellent ink-impressions, made by Dr. Fleet from the original plates, which belongs to Tirkam Râi Tâtyâ Kâsâr Śêṭ, a resident of the well-known **Paiṭhâṇ,─** the ancient Pratishṭhâna,— on the Gôdâvarî, in the Nizâm’s Dominions, lat. 19º 29’ N., long. 75º 28’ E.

......The **plates** are three in number, each measuring from 13½” to 13¾” long, by from 8” to 8½” broad at the ends, and somewhat less in the middle. The edges of them were fashioned thicker, so as to serve as rims to protect the writing ; and the inscription is mostly in a state of excellent preservation. But the surface of the second side of plate ii. was not made properly smooth for engraving, as the other surfaces were. The results is a good deal of confusion, caused by numerous markings in the copper itself. And the difficulty of dealing with this part of the inscription is enhanced by the fact that, in the lower lines of this plate and in the first line of plate iii., the record has been seriously tampered with, for the purpose of reducing the number of grantees from seven to four.— The **ring** on which the plates are strung is circular, about 7/16” thick and 3⅛” in diameter. It had not been cut when the grant came into Dr. Fleet’s hands. The **seal** (see the Plates at page 104), into the socket of which the ring is soldered, is roughly circular, about 1¾” in diameter. In relief on a countersunk surface, it has a representation of Garuḍa, squatting, and facing full-front ; his hands are joined, palm to palm, on the chest, and are turned upwards ; his feet are joined sole to sole, and are turned downwards ; and the marks at each side denote his wings. The seal is practically identical with the seals of the Sâmângaḍ grant of Dantidurga (*Ind. Ant.* Vol. XI. p. 112, Plate), and of the Old-Kanarese grant of Gôvinda III. (*ibid*. p. 126, Plate). But it is a much better specimen, and shows the details far more clearly. Below the Garuḍa there is a floral device,— apparently an expanded water-lily ; he is probably supposed to be seated on it.— The **weight** of the three plates is 357½ tolas, and of the ring and seal, 55½ ; total, 413 tolas,— The engraving is good, bold, and fairly deep ; but, the plates being substantial, the letters do not show through on the reverse sides. The interiors of them show, as usual, marks of the working of the engraver’s tool.— The **characters** are Nâgarî. Here and there they are drawn rather carelessly, so that, especially in the case of proper names, it is not always possible to say what exactly may be intended. In general, the forms of the letters are the ordinary ones of the period to which the inscription belongs ; but the sign for the conjunct *ry,* which occurs in the word *kâryâ* in line 64, is-quite unusual, and is apparently a remnant of an earlier form of the Nâgarî alphabet.¹ The average size of the letters is a little less than
