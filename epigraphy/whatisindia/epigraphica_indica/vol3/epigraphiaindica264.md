****RAJOR INSCRIPTION OF MATHANADEVA.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

the grass and pasture land, with the *udraṅga,* with its rows of tress, with its water, with the *bhôga* and *mayuta*¹ income, with all customary and not customary, fixed and not fixed receipts, the shares of all sorts of grain, the *khala-bhikshâ,² prasthaka, skandhaka, mârgaṇaka,* the fines, ten offences,³ gifts, treasures and deposits, the *aputrikâdhana*⁴ and *nashṭbharaṭa,* and together with all neighbouring fields, cultivated by the **Gûrjaras,─** for the purpose of defraying the expenses of bathing (the god) three times a day, of unguents, flowers, incense, *naivêdya* offerings, lights and oil, of applying white-wash and red lead, of repairing what may become damaged or broken, of public shows and putting on the sacred thread, and of paying labourers, gardeners, *etc.*’ Lines 13-15 shew that the administration of this grant, in the first instance, was entrusted to the holy ascetic Ôṁkâraśivâchârya (a disciple of Rûpaśivâchârya, who again was a disciple of Śrîkaṇṭhâchârya), a member of the **Sôpurîya** line or school (of devotees) started at **Âmardaka,** and inmate of the Nityapramuditadêva *maṭha* at **Râjẏapura,** which was connected with the Gôpâladêvîtaḍâgapâlî *maṭha* at **Chhâttraśiva.⁵** And the donor (in lines 13-17) exhorts his successors not to obstruct, but rather always to assist the ascetic’s disciples and disciples’ disciples in the management of the property⁶ for the benefit of the god (or his temple). Lines 18-20 quote four of the customary benedictive and imprecatory verses ; and the main part of the inscription ends, in line 21, with another verse, according to which this charter (*śâsana*) was composed⁷ by Dêdda, written by his son Sûraprasâda, and engraved by Hari.

......Lines 22-23 then record certain additional taxes or tolls, the proceeds of which were to be made over to the same deity (or temple) jointly with the god Vinâyaka (Gaṇêśa, whose image or shrine was) set up in the lower grounds⁸ adjoining four chapels on one side (of the temple of Lachchhukêśvara). So far as I understand this passage, these taxes were three *viṁśôpakas,* as customary in the market, on every sack⁹ (of agricultural produce) brought for sale to the market ;¹⁰ two *palikâs*¹¹ from every *ghaṭaka-kûpaka* of clarified butter and oil ; two *viṁśôpakas*

......¹ As the inscription is written engraved very carefully, I do not think the word *mayuta* of the text is likely to be a wrong reading ; but its meaning is not apparent.  
......² The exact meaning of this and the following terms I do not know. *Khala-bhikshâ,* ‘the alms of the threshing floor,’ occurs again in *Ep. Ind.* Vol. II. p. 179, v. 42 ; and *khalaka* I find as a revenue-term in *Ind. Ant.* Vol. XVIII. p. 114, l. 55. *Mârgaṇaka* occurs (in *abhinava-mârggaṇaka*) *ibid.* Vol. XVIII. p. 83. l. 20.  
......³ As we find in other inscriptions *sadaśâparâdhdaṇḍa* and *sadaṇḍadaśâparâdha* used as synonymous expressions, I believe that the words of our text, too, are intended to denote ‘the flues for the ten offences,’ whatever these may be. For another explanation of *daṇḍa-daśâparâdha,* the correctness of which appears to me doubtful, see *Journ. Bo. As Soc.* Vol. XVIII. p. 253, note 1.  
......⁴ This term― ‘the property of a daughter who is not a *putrikâ’*― and the following *nashṭibharaṭa* (or perhaps *nashṭabharoṭa*) I am again unable to explain.  
......⁵ So far as I can see, the text in line 14 is not quite correct ; for the word *sambandha,* in my opinion, is meant, to refer, not to *śrî-Râjyapurê,* but to the following *śrî-Nityapramuditadêva-maṭhê.* The difficulty could of course easily be removed by altering *sambandha* to *sambandhê. Gôpâlîdêvî-taḍâga-pâlî-maṭha* would be ‘the *maṭha* on the margin of tank of Gôpâlîdêvî.’ To this religious establishment that at Râjyapura apparently was subordinate.  
......⁶ Here we have the otherwise unknown word *tatti,* in l. 16 in the phrase *tattim . . . kurvataḥ kârayatô vâ,* apparently expressing the sense of the ordinary *bhuñjatô bhôjayatô vâ,* and in l. 17 in the compound *tatti-sânâthya,* ‘rendering assistance in the proper management (?).’  
......⁷ This clearly is the meaning of the word *kṛitavân* in l. 21. The name Dêdda occurs also in one of the Khajurâhô inscriptions ; see *Ep. Ind.* Vol. I. p. 129. v. 47.  
......⁸ The word *jagatî* occurs in *Ind. Ant.* Vol. XIV. p. 160, l. 15.― In the *Archæol. Survey of India,* Vol. XX. p. 125, it is stated that the date Saṁvat 1010 is clearly legible on a figure of Gaṇêśa in the large temple of Nîlakṇṭha at Pâranagar (Râjôr).  
......⁹ Compare, *e.g. Ep. Ind.* Vol. II. p. 240, l. 56, *gôṇîṁ prati viṁśôpakaṁ* ; and, for *viṁśôpaka, ibid.* Vol. I. p. 166.  
......¹⁰ I am not certain about the meaning of the word *haṭṭadâna* in l. 22. It may perhaps be equivalent to *maṇḍapikâ* or *śulka-maṇḍapikâ,* ‘a custom-house,’ which occurs in similar passages of other inscriptions.  
......¹¹ Compare *Ep. Ind.* Vol. I. p. 166. As regards the following *ghaṭaka-kôpaka,* I can only say that *ghaṭa* by itself means ‘a jar, a pitcher, a measure equal to one or to 20 *drôṇas.*’ and *kûpaka* ‘a leather oil vessel.â€™
