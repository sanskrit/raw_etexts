the son of the illustrious **Râjâditya ;** (*and*) who is extremely well-disposed to Brâhmaṇs,― informs all future kings:―

......(L. 20.)— “Be it known to you that,— for the increase of the religious merit of my parents and of myself ; for the sake of acquiring a reward in this world and in the next ; (*and*) for maintaining the *bali,* the *charu,* the *vaiśvadêva,* the *agnihôtra,* the sacrificial rites, *etc.,—* the **village named Gôvaṭṭaṇa, in the Sîharakhî Twelve,** with the (*right of*) taking gold, with (*the right to*) fines and (*punishments for*) the ten offences, with all that is included within the boundaries, with (*its*) sacred bathing-places, with (*its*) **hamlet of (?) Mêshuvallikâ,** (*and*) not to be pointed at by the hand (*of confiscation*) of any of the king’s people, has to-day, **on the (tithi called) vijaya-saptamî,** been granted by me, according to the rule of *bhûmichchhidra* (*and*) with the pouring out of water, (*to the following persons* ; *viz.*),— to the Brâhmaṇ Sôma, son of Sarvadêva, who belongs to the community of the *Chaturvêdins* of **Badarasiddhi,** who is a religious student of the Vâjasanêya-Mâdhyaṁdina (*śâkhâ*), who has an invocation of three original ancestors, and who belongs to the Lâvâyana *gôtra* ; also, the Brâhmaṇ Nâhara, of the Gautama *gôtra,* son of Mahêśvara ; also, Drôṇa, of the Vârshṇêya *gôtra,* son of Śarman ; also, Sôma, of the Kâtyâyana *gôtra,* son of Bappuka ; also, Lakuṭi, whose *gôtra* is the same with that of the Âgnêyas, son of Sarvadêva ; also, Sarvadêva, of the Mudgala *gôtra* ; also, Nêva ; also, his son Gôva ; also, Bhâulla, of the Vatsa *gôtra* ; also Gôvaśarman ; also, Aṇahâditya ; also, Nâsêna ; also, Gôva, of the Gautama *gôtra*, son of Drôṇa ; also, Âditya, of the Pârâśara *gôtra* ; also, Limbâditya, whose *gôtra* is the same with that of the Âgnêyas ; also, Yôga, of the Śaṇḍila *gôtra* ; also, Agniśarman ;

also, Nêvarêva, of the Mudgala *gôtra* ; also, Nâga, of the Mâdhara *gôtra* ; also, Nâṇasara ; also, Rêvasama ; also, Bhâulla, of the Yaugana *gôtra* ; also, Nêvâditya, of the Bharadvâja *gôtra* ; also, Îśvara, of the Kauśa *gôtra* ; also, Bappasvâmin ; also, Gôvaśarman, of the Vârshṇêya *gôtra* ; also, Ṡivâditya ; also, Dêvahaṭa ; also, Sîha, of the Lâvâyana *gôtra* ; also, Nanna, of the Kâtyâyana *gôtra* ; also, Mâtṛiśûra ; also, Mahêśvara, whose *gôtra* is the same with that of the Âgnêyas,— (*and*) he has given his share to the daughter’s son of Nâina ;¹ also, Lalla, of the Bharadvâja *gôtra* ; also, his brother Jajjuka ; also, Datta, of the Saundâna *gôtra* ; also, Agniśarman, whose *gôtra* is the same with that of the Âgnêyas ; also, Nêvâditya ; also, Sambaüra, of the Kauśa *gôtra* ; also, Jajjuka, of the Vârshṇêya *gôtra* ; also, Âditya, of the Gautama *gôtra* ; also, Âdityachîhallaka, the son of Sôma ; also, Agniśarman, of the Mudgala *gôtra* ; (*and*) Rêva, whose *gôtra* is the same with that of the Âgnêyas.

......(L. 43.)— “Wherefore, no one should behave so as to restrain this grant. And this, our gift, should be assented to, and preserved by, future benevolent kings ; understanding that riches are not everlasting, (*and*) that man’s estate is uncertain, and that the reward of a grant of land belongs in common (*both to him who makes it, and to him who continues it*), and understanding also the sin of confiscating it.

......(L. 46.)— “And it has been said by the great sages :— The earth has been enjoyed by many kings, commencing with Sagara ; whosoever at any time possesses the earth, to him belongs, at that time, the reward (*of the grant that is now made, if he continue it*) ! The giver of land abides in heaven for sixty thousand years ; (*but*) the confiscator (*of a grant*), or he who assents (*to an act of confiscation*), shall dwell for the same number of years in hell !”

......(L. 49.)— Written by me, the writer Kṛishṇa, son of Nanna.
