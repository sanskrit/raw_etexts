**TRANSLATION.**

......(Line 1.) Let there be freedom from obstacles !

......(Verse 1.) Let him **(Vishṇu)** protect (*you*), the boar-shaped lord, whose image, while he rescues the earth (*from the ocean*), is reflected in the thousand jewels on the hoods of (*the serpent*) Śêsha, (and) who (*thus*) clearly (*and*) emphatically demonstrates, as it were, his omnipresence to (*his*) devotees !

......(V. 2.) Let him protect (*you*), the elephant-faced **(Gaṇapati),** who, desirous of making a necklace of the jewels on the hoods of (*the snakes which form*) the necklace of Śaṁbhu (Śiva), is touching these (*jewels*) (*and*) looking at the face of (*his*) father !

......(V. 3.) Victorious is that sickle of the moon on the matted hair of Śrîkaṇṭha **(Śiva),** which possesses the luminous beauty of the smooth forehead of Pârvatî.

......(V. 4.) The lotus-seated **(Brahmâ),** who was produced from the lotus on the navel of **Vishṇu,** created the whole movable and immovable world at his (Vishṇu’s) command.
