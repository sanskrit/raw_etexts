......(V. 34.) Let it shine in safety as long as the moon shall exist,— that *agrahâra* (called after) **Śrîkaṇṭha,** which is ever pleasant to dwell in, (*and*) through which becomes celebrated the first (*i.e.* Brâhmaṇa) caste, which is of good conduct, high-minded, free from disease, and of strong body, which is to be represented on account of perpetual goodness, and is the ornament of sacred places, which has appeased the bitter pain of the mind, and which resembles fire in splendour.

......(V. 35.) These verses were written on the plates of the royal edict (*śâsana*) by the wise **Bhôganâtha,** the court-jester (*narma-sachiva*) of king **Saṁgama \[II.\],** in order that **Śrîkaṇṭhapura** might prosper.

...................\[Verses 36-41 contain the usual imprecations, and are therefore left untranslated.\]

......(Line 184.) **Śrî-Virûpâksha.**

......¹ The recipient of this gift was probably the Śaiva temple at Pushpâchala, which is mentioned in the first half of the verse.  
......² The pronoun *tatra* in verse 27 refers to Biṭraguṇṭa in verse 21.
