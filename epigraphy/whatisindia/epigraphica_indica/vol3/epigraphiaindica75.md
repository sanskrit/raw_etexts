****UDAYENDIRAM PLATES OF VIKRAMADITYA II.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

......dhirâja and many other Bâṇa princes had passed away, then there was born in this family―  
1. **Jayanandivarman** (l. 20), who ruled the land west of the **Andhra country.** His son was―  
2. **Vijayâditya I.** (l. 23) ; his son―  
3. **Malladêva,** surnamed **Jagadêkamalla** (l. 28) ; his son―  
4. **Bâṇavidyâdhara** (l. 31) ; his son―  
5. **Prabhumêrudêva** (l. 34) ; his son―  
6. **Vikramâditya I.** (l. 37) ; his son―  
7. **Vijayâditya II.,** also named **Pugalvippavar-Gaṇḍa¹** (l. 39) ; and his son was the donor―  
8. **Vijayabâhu Vikramâditya II.,** who is stated to have been a friend of a certain **Kṛishṇarâja** (l. 43).

......The odd plate contains part of an inscription which a grant made by the same king in favour of some Brâhmaṇs ; and this existing portion of it gives the genealogy of the king commencing with Prabhumêrudêva.

......These inscription are **not dated,** but they may be assigned with some confidence to about the middle of the 12th century A.D. ; for Dr. Hultzsch has shown that the king **Bâṇavidyâdhara** of the above list probably lived during the first half of the 11th century of our era, because he married a grand-daughter of the Gaṅga king **Śivamahârâja,** whom Dr. Hultzsch has shown to have reigned between A.D. 1000 and 1016.²

......The place **Udayêndumaṅgala,** mentioned in the above, has already been identified by Mr. Le Fanu³ with Udayêndiram, where the plates are now preserved.
