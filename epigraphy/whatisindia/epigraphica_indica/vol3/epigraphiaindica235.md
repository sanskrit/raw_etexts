------------------------------------------------------------------------

**serpents** (*lit.* ‘the family of those who have poison on their glances,’— *dṛishṭivisha-kuḷa,* l. 6) ; who was born in **the Nâgavaṁśa,** which is resplendent with the rays of the jewels in the hoods of the members of it ; who had the dignity of the nâga-banner (l. 7) ; who had **the crest of a tiger ;** who was **the supreme lord of the town Bhôgâvatî ;** who was a very Nârâyaṇa among **the Sindas** (l. 9) ; and who, even unaided, was a very Śûdraka.

......There is ten introduced Pulikâla’s genealogy :— Saying : “I will behold the region of the earth which is so belauded by the sons of men.” there came (*from the lower regions*) **Dharaṇêndra, the serpent-king** (l. 10), leaving his army behind him out of respect,— both he and his wife, through the affection that existed between them ; and then, on her becoming pregnant, there was born to his lady, **at Ahichchhatra** (l. 11-12) **in the region of the river Sindhû,** a prince named **Sinda** (l. 12), resplendent with lustrous glory. Being much perplexed (*at the birth of a son in human form*), the serpent-king said to **a tiger :─** “Carefully preserve this child in safety” (l. 13). Thereupon the tiger, preferring in turn his own request to the lord of snakes, said :— “Cause him to become a great lord the earth” (l. 14). And so the boy was nourished, and, becoming the lord of **the Sinda country** (l. 15) and practicing exalted and brave precepts, developed **long arms of prowess** which surpassed everything else on the earth. When the **long-armed lord Sinda** joined his hands and closed his eyes (*in respectful request*), **the lord of the Kaḍambas** (l. 16) through affection gave him his daughter ; and, he having taken her, during the time that he lived in dalliance with that charming woman, there were born **three sons** (l. 17), from whom there sprang those who were born as kings in the most exalted **race of the Sindas (l. 18).**

......While they, **thirty-one** (*in succession*),¹ were governing **the Bâgaḍage district** with freedom from anxiety, there was born (*another*) prince named **Sinda** (l. 19).
