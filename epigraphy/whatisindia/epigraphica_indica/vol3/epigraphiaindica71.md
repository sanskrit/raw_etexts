During a space of time which fell in the **Śaka year** (*expressed by the chronogram*) **tuṅgaśrîka** (*i.e.* 1236), the holy lord **Jñânamûrti** erected the everlasting (*and*) very lofty *maṇḍapa*, named Bhadra, for Śaṁbhu (Śiva), the lord of **Śrî-Valla,** who is resplendent with a creeper-like coil of hair, that is adorned with a multitude of excellent serpents, the celestial river (Gaṅgâ), and the crescent of the moon.

**B.— ARULALA-PERUMAL INSCRIPTION OF CHAMPA.  
  
Saka-Samvat 1236.**

......This short inscription² is engraved on the outermost *gôpura* of the **Aruḷâḷa-Perumâḷ** temple at **Tiruvattiyûr** (Little Conjeeveram). It is written in the **Grantha** alphabet and consists of one Sanskṛit verse, and a few words in Sanskṛit prose at the end. It belongs to the same **Śaka year (1236)** and to same chief as the preceding inscription. This chiefs is, however, here called **Champa,** the son of **Vîra-Chôḷa,** while the other inscription calls him Vîra-Champa, the son of the Chôḷa king. The inscription was composed by Champa’s minister **Vanabhid,** in order to record that the chief presented a new car to the temple. As in other inscriptions, the deity of the temple is here called **“the god of the Elephant-mountain.”³**
