**No. 46.─ GANESGAD PLATES OF DHRUVASENA I. ;  
  
\[GUPTA-\]SAMVAT 207.  
  
BY E. HULTZSCH, PH. D.**

......The copper plates which bear the subjoined inscription, were found in a field at **Gaṇêśgaḍ** in the Dâmnagar tâlukâ of the Baroda State. In March 1894, Major W. B. Ferris, then Assistant Agent to the Governor-General, Baroda, sent them to Dr. Fleet, who very kindly placed them at my disposal for publication. They have now been returned to Baroda.

......The plates are two in number and measure about 11 by 7⅝ inches. The edges of their inner, inscribed sides are raised into rims to protect the writing. When the plates reached me, they were covered with a thick layer of rust. Having been immersed for a few weeks in several changes of toddy and tamarind, and occasionally brushed with diluted nitric acid (1 : 20), they became quite legible, and are now in a fair state of preservation. The engraving is so deep that many letters show through distinctly at the back of the plates. Through two holes at the bottom of the first plate and two others at the top of the second plate are passed two pieces of copper wire, which is about ⅛ inch thick. The wire on the right is bent into a ring, but not soldered. The second wire is also twisted into a ring, which had not yet been cut when the plated reached me ; and the two ends of the wire are secured in a knob projecting from
