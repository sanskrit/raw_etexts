****UDAYENDIRAM PLATES OF NANDIVARMAN.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

only ; the writing on the first side of the first plate, however, does not form part of the body of the inscription (which is in Sanskṛit), but is an endorsement in Tamil. The plates are held together by a ring, 3” in diameter and about ⅜” thick, which is now cut. It holds a circular **seal**, 2⅛” in diameter, which contains in bas-relief a standing bull, facing the proper left, and a much worn and illegible inscription round the margin. The engraving is good, and the writing is well preserved.— **Of the inscription proper** (on plates i.*b*, ii. and iii.*a*) **the size of the letters** is between ¼” and ⅜”. The **characters** belong to the southern class of alphabets. They closely resemble the characters of what the late Dr. Burnell has termed the Eastern Châlukya alphabet about A.D. 680 (*Elements of South-Indian Palæography*, second edition, Plate v.), and differ¹ therefore decidedly from those of the Uruvupalli grant of the Pallava dynasty (*Ind. Ant.* Vol. V. p. 51, Plate), with which the present inscription otherwise has much in common. The **language** is Sanskṛit, and, excepting two imprecatory verses in lines 17 and 18, the whole is in prose.— The text has been drawn up most carelessly, as may be seen from the omission of single syllables and whole words, as well as from the repeated occurrence of groups of *aksharas* that are devoid of meaning. In respect of **orthography** also, the inscription is full of faults, some of which may be accounted for by the influence of the writer’s vernacular. Thus, the sign of *visarga* is throughout omitted ; and similarly the sign of *anusvâra* or of the final *m* is omitted everywhere except in te word *Pallav*\[*â\**\]*nâṁ,* in line 10. We have *a* instead of final *ô* in *prapautra*, l. 2, *pautra*, l. 4,
-*dĩkshita*, l. 8 ; and instead of final *ê* in –*râshṭira*, l. 11. The palatal sibilant is used six times for the dental sibilant, and the dental five times for the palatal.

Unaspirated letters are employed instead of aspirates in *Vaśâka* (for *Vaiśâkha*), l. 19, *lavda* (for *labdha*), l. 8 and *bakti* (for *bhakti*), l. 6 ; and soṇant consonants instead of surd ones in *bhaṭṭâragô* (for *bhaṭṭâraka*), l. 9, and *Daitṛiya* (for *Taittirîya*), l. 12. Besides, we find *ch* for *ś* in *Kuḷancharmmaṇê*, l. 13 ; *tth* for *ddh* in -*âttharaṇa* (for –*ôddharaṇa*), l. 9 ; *dh* for *d* in -*âdhi-prâdhânai* (for –*âdi-pradânaiḥ*), l. 5 ; and for *ddh* in *sidhi,* l. 3, and *sannadhô,* l. 9 ; *b* for *v* in *brata*, l. 7 ; and *v* for *p* in *uvanata*, l. 3 ; and for *b* in *vala*, lines 1 and 14, *lavda*, l. 8, and *vappa*, l. 9. In lines 17 and 18 a final *m* has been five times left unchanged before a consonant, where it should have been changed to *anusvâra* ; and *m* is irregularly doubled in the body of a word in *avagammya*,² l. 14, and at the end of a word before a following vowel in *ºsvâsanamm= atiº* (for *ºchahhâsanam=atiº*) and *śârîramm=aruhaº* (for *śârîram=arhaº*), in l. 16. Instead of the conjunct *jñ* we have *ñy*³ in *râñya* (for in *râñya* and *râjñaḥ*), in lines 1 and 2 ; and, to facilitate the pronunciation, a vowel has been inserted or y vocalised in a conjunct in *râahṭira* (for *râshṭrê*) l. 11, *aruhati* (for *arhati*), l. 16, *salôkâ* (for *ślôkâ*), l. 16, *-mariyâdaśya, mariyâdeyâ, mariyâdayâ* (for –*maryâdasya* and *maryâdayâ*), lines 2, 11 and 13, and *aisvariya* (for *aiśvarya*), l. 14. The vowel *ṛi* is represented by the syllable *ir* in *virdha* (for *vṛiddha*), twice in l. 4, *pravirdha* (for *pravṛiddha*), l. 5, and *bhavirdhaé* (for *abhivṛddhayê*), l. 14 ; and, on the other hand, *ṛi* is employed instead of *irî*⁴ in *Daitṛiya* (for *Taittirîya*), l. 12. Lastly, the short vowel *e*, which is unknown to Sanskṛit, but common in Tamil, is improperly used, partly through the influence of a following *y*, in *maryâdeyâ* (for *maryâdayâ*), l. 11, *vijeyâ* and *vejeya* (for *vijaya*), in lines 8, 14, and 19, and *veneya* (for *vinaya*), l. 4. In addition to these errors the text contains others which need not be enumerated here.— The size of the letters of **the endorsement** on the first side of t5he first plate is between ⅛’’ and ¼” ; the characters are Tamil and Grantha ; and the language is Tamil.

......¹ This difference is shown especially, *e.g.,* by the forms of the initial *a* and of the consonants *k, i, a* and *r.*— I may state here that in the present inscription it is often quite impossible to distinguish between the superscript *i* and *î*, and that, accordingly, in my transcript of the text, I have put *i* and *î,* where either of the two was required.  
......² Here the doubling of *m* might be justified by Pâṇini, viii. 4, 47.  
......³ It is clear that *jñ* was so pronounced by the writer.  
......⁴ *Satṛi* for *satra* (***sattra***) in l. 7 is probably due only to an error of the engraver.
