**BITRAGUNTA GRANT OF SAMGAMA II.**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

completion of all obsequial rites ; and this completion is reached with the *sâpiṇḍya* and *âbdika* ceremonies, which are to be observed at the end of one full year after the death. After this period, and through the several charities made during the final ceremonies, the *Prêta* is supposed to become one of the Manes, *i.e.* to become classed with the *Pitṛidêvas*.¹ Thus, it may be that the anniversary on which immortality or godhead was conferred on Kampa, was the first ; and if so, **the date of Kampa’s death and the accession of Saṁgama II.** would be **Śaka-Saṁvat 1277.** But this is only a conjecture which requires corroboration.

......The contents of the inscription furnish us with two important facts, *viz*. first, the distinct mention of the **five sons of Saṁgama I.,** and, secondly, that of a grandson of his, by name **Saṁgama II.** Both these facts are valuable ; for, most of the inscriptions that contain a regular genealogy of the Vijayanagara dynasty, mention only Harihara I. and Bukka I., the first and third sons of Saṁgama I., and ignore altogether the other three ; and even the limited few that mention all the five sons of Saṁgama I.,² are either open to suspicion or are imperfectly read. The importance of the second fact is even greater, inasmuch as it enables us to correct certain inferences which have been drawn from the colophon of the *Mâdhavîyâ Dhâtuvṛitti.* This colophon reads as follows :— “The *Mâdhavîyâ Vṛitti,* composed by **Sâyaṇâchârya** (who was) the uterine brother of **Mâdhava**, the son **Mâyaṇa**, (and) the great minister of **Saṁgamarâja**, the son of **Kamparâja**, the glorious lord of the Eastern,

Western and Southern oceans.”³ As the title indicates, the *Mâdhavîyâ Dhâtuvṛitti* was dedicated by its author, Sâyaṇâchârya, to his brother **Mâdhavâchârya,** who, as we learn from other sources, was the minister of **Bukkaṇa or Bukka I.** of Vijayanagara.⁴ Further, Mâdhavâchârya says of himself that “his mother (was) **Śrîmatî**, his father (was) the famous **Mâyaṇa**, (and) his two uterine brothers (were) **Sâyaṇa** and **Bhôganâtha**, (who appeared to be his) mind and intelligence.”⁵ *That* Saṁgama, whose minister was Sâyaṇa according to the *Mâdhavîyâ Dhâtuvṛitti,* has been hitherto considered as identical with Saṁgama I., the father of Harihara I. and Bukka I. The present inscription, however,— which acquaints us with a king **Saṁgama II.,** who, as the Saṁgamarâja of the colophon of the *Mâdhavîyâ Dhâtuvṛitti*, was the son of **Kampa**, and which also mentions a certain **Bhôganâtha**, who is probably identical with that Bhôganâtha who, according to the commentary on the *Parâśarasmṛiti*, was the brother of Sâyaṇa,— shows that Sâyaṇa must have been the minister of Saṁgama II., and not of Saṁgama I., who, in the present state of our epigraphical knowledge, is nothing more than a name. In the colophon of his commentary on the *Śatapathabrâhmaṇa*, **Sâyaṇâchârya** calls himself the minister of king **Harihara**, who bore the titles of *Râjâdhirâja* and *Râjaparamêśvara*.⁶ This can hardly refer to Harihara I., who claimed to be only a Mahâmaṇḍalêśvara ;⁷ and it must be assumed that Sâyaṇa, who was originally the minister of **Saṁgama II.,** subsequently held the same office under **Harihara II.** According to
