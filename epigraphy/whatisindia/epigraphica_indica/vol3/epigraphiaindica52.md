**TRANSLATION.**

......Victorious is the footprint interspersed with the brightness of the toe-nails . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . bowed down, of (the god) Vishṇu, the creator of the (three) worlds, who traversed the whole universe in three strides !

......(Line 1.)— In **the lineage of the Chalukyas,** who are **the Mânavya gôtrâ** (*and*) are **Hâritiputras,—** of **Kîrtivarman (I.),** the first maker of **Vâtâpî,** whose pious form was thoroughly well moistened by ablutions performed after celebrating many sacrifices, who was the abode of all auspiciousness, who was the king of favourites, (*and*) who was endowed with fame, the son (*is*)—

......(L. 3.)— That ornament of **the family of the Chalukyas,** that asylum of all good qualities, that person who has but few foes, the glorious **Satyâśraya-(Pulikêśin II.)** by name, whose besmearing with sandal-wood oil is rubbed off by (*the clinging of*) the bulky breasts of the goddess of fortune who practices (*towards him*) the vow of treating a husband like a god ; whose pure fame plays the part of a husband towards the women of the Kinnaras in the hall of (Indra) the lord of the gods ; who is a very sun just risen above the mountain of dawn which is (*his*) elephant, infuriated with rut, the head of which is bathed in the trickling stream of blood that flows forth from the hearts of the enemies which are cleft open by the thunder-bolt that is its tusk ; who punishes wicked people ; who receives with hospitality learned people and friends ; who confers favours upon servants ; who has lit up the field of battle with the flames of the fire that rises from the tusks of the elephants of the hostile kings which are the eyes of nice young women ; whose keen intellect is capable of examining the essence of the meaning of various Śâstras ; (*and*) who, (*indeed*) a king, having bravely planted (*his*) footstep over (*his*) enemies, has taught the goddess of fortune, who is fickle by nature, the observances of a true and faithful wife.

......(L. 8.)— He, the king, issues a command to the inhabitants of **the Avarêtikâ vishaya** to this effect :— “My maternal uncle, the ornament of **the Sêndrakas,** the most devout worshipper of (the god) Mahêśvara, **Śrîvallabha-Sênânandarâja,** who has acquired (*a knowledge of all*) the proper and improper practices of noble people , (*and*) who has covered all the spaces between the quarters of the compass with the canopy of (*his*) fame that was purchased by the price of his valour,— he, the king, in order to increase the religious merit of (*his*) parents and of himself, has given to Mahêśvara, the son of Kṛishṇasvâmin, of the Âtrêya *gôtra,* who has performed sacrifices, these two things, free from the right of entry by the irregular and regular troops, by messengers, and by the king’s servants,— (*viz*.) **the village of Âmra- vaṭavaka, and twenty at (the village of) Avañchapalî on the (river) Vârubennâ.³** Let all kings, born in my race, and other rulers of the earth, and (*all*) feudatory chiefs in the world, be made to know (*that*) any ruler of the earth who may obstruct the enjoyment of this (*grant*),— to him will attach the penalty of one who commits the five sins.”
