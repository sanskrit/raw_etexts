who calls himself ‘king of the people of **Tañjai** (Tanjore)’¹ and who was very probably identical with **Gaṇḍarâdityavarman,** mentioned in the large Leyden grant as the second son of Parântaka I. The eighth verse of this hymn refers to a Chôḷa who conquered the dominions of the **Pâṇḍya** king and **Ceylon,** and who was the lord of **Uraiyûr.** It further states that this king covered with gold the hall at **Chidambaram.** The *Vikrama-Śôlan-Ulâ,* extracts from which were lately published by Mr. V. Kanakasabhai Pillai, mentions a king ‘who constructed a roof of gold to the sacred hall in the temple at **Chidambaram.’²** The *Tiruviśaippâ* and the *Vikrama-Śôlan-Ulâ* evidently refer to the event that is mentioned in the large Leyden grants as having occurred during the time of **Parântaka I.** The *Koṅgudêśarâjâkkaḷ,* a chronicle the statements made in which are to be accepted with caution, notices a real historical event when it says that the Chôḷa king **Vîranârâyaṇa** built the **Kanakasabhâ** at Chidambaram.³ From the Udayêndiram plates it appears that Parântaka I. married the daughter of the **Kêrala** king.⁴ Leaving aside the numerous unpublished inscriptions of Parântaka I., the five published ones, which have been found at **Conjeeveram** in the Chingleput district, **Tiruppûndurutti** near Tanjore, and **Udayêndiram** in the North Arcot district, show that his dominions must have been very wide. The latest date we have for him, is the 36th year of his reign.⁵
