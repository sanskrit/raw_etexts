****BAMANI INSCRIPTION OF VIJAYADITYA.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kundakunda lineage’ ;¹ exempting the grant from all taxes and molestations. Lines 34-41 contain five imprecatory verses ; these are followed in lines 42-43 by another well known verse in praise of the Jaina doctrine ; and lines 43-44 add, in Old-Kanarese, that this inscription was engraved by Gôvyôja, the son the goldsmith Bammyôja,² and lay-disciple³ of Abhinandadêva.

......As regards **the date** of this grant, the year Pramôda is Śaka-Saṁvat 1073, here too as a *current* (not, as stated erroneously in the text, as an expired) year ; and for Śaka-Saṁvat 1073 current the given day corresponds to **Friday, the 8th September, A.D. 1150,** when there was a total **lunar eclipse** 20 h. 6 m. after mean sunrise, which of course was **visible in India.**

......Of **the localities** mentioned, in addition to those which have already been spoken of in the preceding inscription, I am unable to identify the village of **Maḍa\[l\]ûra ;** and I can only hesitatingly suggest that the concluding part of the mutilated name of the district, . . **ṇavu\[ka\]-gegoḷḷa,** may perhaps survive in the name of the town of Kâgal, in the neighbourhood of which the inscription is still preserved.
