****RANGANATHA INSCRIPTION OF SUNDARA-PANDYA.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

is now partially in ruins. I was told that the stones of several *maṇḍapas* and of the enclosure of the rank in front of the temple were utilised for building the bridges over the Koḷḷiḍam (Coleroon) and the Kâvêrî rivers. The south wall of the shrine still bears an inscription of the **Hoysaḷa** king **Vîra-Râmanâthadêva,** in which the temple is called Pôśaḷîśvara (for **Poysa- ḷêśvara**), *i.e.* ‘the Îśvara (temple) of the Poysaḷa (king).’ The name by which the temple goes now, Bhôjîśvara, is a corruption of the original Pôśaḷîśvara, and owes its origin to a confusion between the long-forgotten Poysaḷa king the popularly known king Bhôja. The walls of a neighbouring modern temple of Kâlî, called Śellâyi, contain detached inscribed stones on which some Hoysaḷa *birudas* are distinctly visible, and which, therefore, appear to have originally belonged to the Poysaḷêśvara temple.¹ The Poysaḷêśvara of the Kaṇṇanûr inscription is evidently the temple to which the Jambukêśvara inscription refers. Accordingly, there can be no doubt that **the modern Kaṇṇanûr is the actual site of Vikramapura, the southern residence of Sômêśvara.**

......As regards **Vîra-Râmanâthadêva,** he must have been a successor of **Sômêśvara,** an inscription of whose 23rd year is quoted in an inscription of the 4th year of Râmanâtha in the **Jambukêśvara** temple. His relation to the hitherto known chief line of the **Hoysaḷa** dynasty is established by an inscription of the **Raṅganâtha** temple, which records a gift by **Ponnambalamahâdêvî,²** who styles herself the uterine sister of **Vîra-Râmanâthadêva** and the daughter of the **Hoysaḷa** king **Vîra-Sômêśvara** by the **Châḷukya** princess **Dêvalamahâdêvî.³** It thus appears that, while Sômêśvara was succeeded on the throne of Dvârasamudra by Narasiṁha III., his son by Bijjaladêvî,⁴ the southern part of his dominions went to Râmanâtha, his son by Dêvaladêvî. An inscription in the **Jambukêśvara** temple furnishes the name of one of the queens of king Râmanâthadêva. This was **Kamalâdêvî,** the daughter of a certain Ariya-Piḷḷai. The name of this queen’s younger sister was **Chikka-Sômaladêvî,⁵** who appears to have received the Kanarese prefix *chikka*, ‘younger,’ in order to distinguish her from the elder **Sômaladêvî,⁶** who was one of the queens of Râmanâtha’s father Sômêśvara. The two temples at Śriraṅgam and the above-mentioned temple at Kaṇṇanûr contain the following Tamil dates of the reign of Vîra-Râmanâthadêva :—

The last compound refers to the temple at Sômanâthapura in the Talakâḍu tâlukâ of the Maisûr district, which is mentioned in two inscriptions of Śaka-Saṁvat 1191 and 1192 ; see Mr. Rice’s *Mysore Inscriptions* pp. 48 ff. and 323 ff.

......⁵ *Dêvar Irâmanâthadêvar araśimâril Ariya-Piḷḷai magaḷâr Kamalâdêviyâr taṅgaiyâr Śikkachchômala-dêviyâr.  * ......⁶ This queen is mentioned in three inscriptions of Vîra-Sômêśvaradêva, *viz*. one of the 6th year in the Raṅganâtha temple, one of the 25th year in the Jambukêśvara temple, and the Bangalore Museum plates of Śaka-Saṁvat 1175 (see p. 8 above, note 5).
