**ABRIDGED TRANSLATION.**

......Verse 1 contains an invocation, addressed to the Boar-incarnation of **Vishṇu.**

......(V. 2.) “Like the celestial river (Gaṅgâ), a certain **caste** (*jâti*), which is distinguished by great virtues (*and*) whose profession4 deserves respect, took origin, for the welfare of men, from the lotus foot of (**Vishṇu**) whose navel (*bears*) a lotus.â€?

......In this caste was born king **Prôla** (v. 3). His son was king **Vêma** (v. 4), who performed the gifts described by **Hêmâdri** (v. 5).

......(V. 6.) “Desirous of ascending **Mêru,** Mandara and Kailâsa,⁵ the high-minded king **Vêma** constructed a flight of steps at **Śrîśaila.**â€?

......He had two sons, **Anna-Vôta** and **Anna-Vêma** (v. 7), the elder of whom succeeded his father in the kingdom (v. 8).

......(V. 9.) “He granted many *agrahâras* ; he performed the gifts (*described by*) **Hêmâdri ;** he built rest-houses (*sattra*) at places of pilgrimage (*tîrtha*) ; and he thoroughly gained the affection of (*his*) subjects.â€?

......He was succeeded by (his younger brother) **Anna-VÃªma** (v. 10).

......(V. 13.) “He who was surnamed **Vasantarâya,** caused not only the earth, but also the sky, to be perfumed with musk, camphor and sandal, scattered (*at the spring festival*).

......(V. 14.) “Did the three worlds become white through the copious camphor-powder scattered at his spring festivals, or through his fame ?

......(V. 15.) “This hero, who is surnamed the glorious **Pallava-Trinêtra,** rules the prosperous city of **Koṇḍavîṭi,** which is situated to the east of **Śrîśaila.**

......(Vv. 16 and 17.) “As Lakshmî of the Moon, the uterine sister of this **Anna-Vêma** (*is*) the famous **Vêmasâni,** the queen (*mahishî*) of the glorious prince **Nallanûṅka** (*who resembles*) Vishṇu in splendour. She possesses the seven kinds of offspring (*sapta-saṁtâna*)⁶ (*and*) daily performs the gifts prescribed in the rules (*kalpa*) of **Hêmâdri.**

......(V. 18.) “In the **Śaka** year reckoned by the tastes (6), the jewels (9), and the suns (12),— (*in figures*) **1296,─** when the moon was swallowed by Râhu, on the Kârttikî (*tithi*), before (*the god*) **Vijayêśvara,** on the bank of the holy **Gautamî,─** that king **Anna-Vêma** gave to Brâhmaṇas the excellent village called **Naḍupûru in Kôṇasthala,** for the religious merit of (*his*) sister, the illustrious **Vêmasâni.**
