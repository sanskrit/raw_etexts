......¹ Originally *ºrâjyêḥ* appears to have been engraved. The following sign of punctuation is superfluous.  
......² Read –*vinirggatô* and –*prasûtô.*  
......³ This word chaḍaka is not Sanskṛit ; it probably is connected with the root *chaṭ,* ‘to break,’ and apparently the whole *biruda* is equivalent to *aribalanishûdana.* Compare also the Marâṭhî *chaḍaka,* ‘a slap, a strocke.’  
......⁴ *Nâman* is quite superfluous here ; its sense is contained in the following *samastarâjâvalî.*  
......⁵ Read –*râṇakaḥ* ; but the words in the whole pharse, beginning with *tatpâdapadm-ôpajîvî* in line 4, should really have been put in the Locative.The following sign of punctuation is again superfluous.  
......⁶This word and the following words in the Nominative case, qualifying as they do *Vâsudêvêna* in line 9, should have been put in the Instrumental.  
......⁷ This sign of *visarga* was originally omitted.  
......⁸ Read –*śâkhâyâṁ*, or perhaps rather –*śâkhîyô*.  
......⁹ Read *ºrîyô*.  
......¹⁰ *Paṇatî* and *nîtî* in the following compound are clearly closely related to and synonymous with the Marâṭî *paṇatû*, ‘great-grandson,’ and *nâtû,* ‘grandson ;’ the Sanskṛit words would be *pranaptâ* and *naptâ.*  
......¹¹ The first *akshara* of this name might also be read *vvô* or, perhaps, *ghô* ; the last *akshara* was originally *pau,* but has been altered to *pai.*  
......¹² Read –*putrô.*  
......¹³ On the termination *u* of this and of some of the following words see my remarks on page 304 above.  
......¹⁴ The *akshara* in brackets may possibly be *syê*. I do not understand the exact meaning of this compound ; perhaps it has reference to religious observances on the 12th day (*dvâdaśî*) of the two halves of the month.  
......¹⁵ Read *Nârasiṁha.º*  
......¹⁶ Intended for *gṛihîtâni bhûmi-nivarttanâni dvâdaśa.* On the construction of the numerals here and below compare *Ind. Ant.* Vol. XVI. p. 207.  
......¹⁷ Probably intended for *êtâ bhûmayaḥ pratipâditâḥ.*  
......¹⁸ Read *êtâ bhûmîr=yê lôpayaṁti tê Brahma-Vishṇu-Mahêśvarâṁl-lôpayaṁti* \| *êraṁ yô gâ lôpayati sa kuṁbhîpâkê patati* \|\|
