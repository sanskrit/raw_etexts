Museum grant, it may be added that portions of the text are bodily misplaced ; and the context is so mixed up that, without the other records as a guide, most of it would be hopelessly unintelligible.

......The next point to command attention is **the palæography of the grants,** as far as published lithographs are available.

......The **Tanjore grant** purports to have been issued in A.D. 248. But every character in it betrays a far later date ; and, taken all together, they point to **the tenth century A.D., as the earliest possible period for the fabrication of the record.** This was recognised by Dr. Burnell (*South-Indian Palæography*, pp. 34, 35, and Plate xi.), who classed the alphabet among the Grantha-Tamil alphabets, and expressed the opinion that the documents,— distinctly styled by him “a forgery,”— shews the condition of the northern Chêra characters about the tenth century. A most tell-tale character in this record is the *l* : it is distinctly a **Grantha character of a late type ;** and the only approximation to it, that I can find , is in the Grantha alphabet exhibited by Dr. Burnell in his Plate xiv., and allotted by him to A.D. 1383.
