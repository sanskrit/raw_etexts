**No. 38.─ FOUR ANCIENT TAMIL INSCRIPTIONS  
  
AT TIRUKKALUKKUNRAM.  
  
BY V. VENKAYYA, M.A.**

......**Tirukkaulukkunram,** or Pakshitîrtham as it is called in Sanskṛit, is a large village in the Chingleput district on the road on the road from Chigleput to the port of Sadras, about half-way between both. There are two temples, one in the village of Tirukkalukkunram, called **Vêdagirîśvara,** and another, named Bhaktavatsala, on a neighbouring hill. Of the four subjoined inscriptions, which are engraved on the wall of the strong-room (*tiruv-âbharaṇa-koṭṭaḍi*) of the Vêdagirîśvara temple, three were already published in *Madras Christian College Magazine*⁷ from pencil transcripts prepared by myself on the spot. At the suggestion of the Editor, I now republish, from inked estampages, these three inscriptions, along with a fourth, which was not yet published, but only referred to in one of my former articles.⁸

......That part of the wall where these inscriptions are found, is disfigured by a number of mason’s marks, which are notice in the footnotes to the texts. These marks consist, in most cases, of Tamil numerals, engraved probably before attempting to pull down the wall with a view to repair the temple. The numerals would indicate the order in which the stones had to be arranged while rebuilding the wall. This custom of marking is still prevalent in Southern India, as may be seen on the walls of the temples at Madura and Chidambaram, which have been lately repaired, and of the Êkâmranâtha temple at Conjeeveram, which is now undergoing repair. In these place the numerals are not cut with the chisel as at Tirukkalukkunram, but painted on the stones with tar or chunnam. The alphabet and language of the four subjoined inscriptions is **Tamil ;** but a number of words of Sanskṛit origin are written either wholly or partially in **Grantha** characters. The following is a list of such words and syllables, with the exception of two words *svasti śrî,* which occur at the beginning of every one of these inscriptions and are, as a matter of course, written in the Grantha alphabet.

......In A. line l, *kôv=irâja, sa of kêsari,* and *parmma* (for *varma*) ; l. 3, *śrî-Mûlasthâna* ; l. 4, *Skandaśishyan* ; l. 5, *śiṁ of Naraśiṁga* ; l. 6, *rakshi* ; *pûrvva* at the end of l. 7 ; l. 8, *râjâ* of *râjâkkaḷ, râja* and \[*sa*\]*ri* of *Râjakêsari* ; l. 9, *rmma* and *ddharmam rakshi.*

......In B. line 1, *kô* of *kô-Pparaº* ; l. 4, *śrî-Mûlastâº* (for *Mûlasthâº*) ; l. 7, *kô* of *kûyinaṅgai* ; l. 9, *ºntr-âdiº* (for *ºndr-âdiº*), *ºtha*\[*r*\]*mma* (for *ºddharmam*), *rakshi,* and *sa* ; \[*ºbhai*\] at the beginning of l. 10.

......¹ Read *vijñêyam* (?).  
......² Read \|\| *tathâ.*  
......³ Read *mantavyâ yathâ* (?) *prati-varshaṁ* ; the sign of the vowel *î* of *vîrsha* is almost certainly struck out in the original.  
......⁴ I am unable to suggest a proper correction, but believe *arbhaṇâ* to stand for *arhaṇd.*  
......⁵ Read *drammâṇi.*  
......⁶ This line commences in the original with *śataº*, and *shashṭhâdhika* is engraved below *śatadvaya*, in a separate line.  
......⁷ Vol. VIII. p. 267 ff. and Vol. IX. p. 745 ff.  
......⁸ *ibid.* Vol. IX. p. 748 f.
