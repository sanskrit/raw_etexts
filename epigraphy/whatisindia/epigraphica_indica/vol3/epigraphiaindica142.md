****THE SIDDAPURA EDICTS OF ASOKA.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Edict agrees with the Rûpnâth version or with that of Śiddâpura, or if it tells us something still different, as M. Senart thinks, will be discussed on another occasion. I, of course, admit that M. Senart is right in rejecting Dr. Bhagvânlâl’s conjectural emendation *husaṁ te* for *saṁta,* which, in 1877, I inserted in my text. I now believe that *saṁta* does not require any alternation.

......7. ***Kâmaṁ,*** ‘in any case,’ may also be translated by ‘at his desire.’

......8. The sermon which is spoken of here and at the end of this section, consists only of the six words beginning with *khudakâ cha* and ending with *pakameyu ti,* and it does not, as I thought formerly, go as far as *diyaḍhiyaṁ vaḍhisiti.* The *ti* after *pakameyu* proves the correctness of the former statement. The use of an additional pleonastic *yathâ* in No. II at the beginning of the sentence is in accordance with classical Sanskṛit usage ; see the examples quoted in the larger *St. Petersburg Dictionary* under *yathâ.*

......9. The correct explanation of *aṁtâ* has first been given by M. Senart. If further proof were needed, it is furnished by the additional *mai,* i.e. *me* of our version.

......10. As stated already in the introductory remarks, I still believe the word *Vyûtha* to refer to **Gautama-Buddha,** and the figure to the number of years elapsed since the **Nirvâṇa.** But I now admit that *Vyûtha-Vivutha* may be derived from *vivas*, and I take it as representative of *Vyushṭa.* The verb *vivas* occurs indeed not rarely in the sense of ‘to elapse, to pass away ;’ see, *e.g.,* Gôbhila’s *Gṛihyasûtra,* ii. 8,– *jananâd daśarâtrê vyushṭê,* which Professor Oldenberg renders correctly : “When ten nights have elapsed after (*the child’s*) birth ;” and *Pañchatantra,* ii. p. 25, l. 11 (Bombay S. Ser.),— *anêna vârttâvyatikarêṇa rajanî vyushṭâ.*

......11. The correct beginning of the second edict has been first recognized by M. Senart.

......12. *Garutva,* which (if the correct reading) is analogous to the form *tadatva* (Rock-Edicts, Kâlsî, X.), can of course be used like *gaurava*¹ in the sense of ‘respect for.’ *Drahyitavyaṁ is the* future passive participle formed from the stem of the present *drahyati,* which corresponds to the Sanskṛit verb *dṛih*, though the participle *daḷha* and its derivatives show that one must have existed.

......13. If the reading *ku* is the correct one, the word must be taken as a representative of *khu* or *kho* ; compare the Shâhbâzgarhî version of the Rock-Edicts, IV. 9, *etc*.

......14. *Pakitî* has here either the meaning of *svarûpa* or of *yôni,* which the Sanskṛit *prakṛiti* has so often. *Dharmasya* or *âchârasya* must be understood.

......15. Compare Manu, ii. 121 :— *Abhivâdanaśîlasya nityaṁ vṛiddôpasêvinaḥ* \| *chatvâri tasya vardhanta âyur vidyâ yaśô balam* \|\| and the parallel passages quoted in the Synopsis to my *Translation*.

**No. 23.─ UDAYENDIRAM PLATES OF NANDIVARMAN.  
  ** .....................**BY F . KIELHORN, PH.D., C.I.E. ; GÖTTINGEN.**

......This inscription has been previously published, with a photo-lithograph, by the Rev. T. Foulkes, in the *Indian Antiquary,* Vol. VIII. pp. 167 ff., and in the *Manual of the Salem District,* Vol. II. pp. 349 ff. I re-edit it from an excellent impression received from Dr. Hultzsch, to whom the original plates, which are at **Udayêndiram** in the Guḍiyâtam tâlukâ of the North Arcot district, were lent by the Acting Collector of the district, Mr. F. A. Nicholson, I.C.S.

......The inscription is on **three copper-plates,** each of which measures 8¾” long by 2⅝ ” high. The first and second plates are inscribed on both sides, and the third is inscribed on one side
