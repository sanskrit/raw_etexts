**No. 42.─ SITABALDI INSCRIPTION OF THE TIME OF VIKRAMADITYA VI. ;  
SAKA-SAMVAT 1008.  
  
BY F. KIELHORN, PH. D., LL.D., C.I.E. ; GÖTTINGEN.**

......This inscription is on an elaborately sculptured pillar which was found by the late General Sir A. Cunningham at **Sîtâbaldî,** near Nâgpur, in the Central Provinces, and is now in the Government Museum at Nâgpur.⁷ To judge from the photograph before me, the sculptured part of the pillar measures about 5’ high by 2½’ broad, of which the inscription occupies the middle portion. Above the inscription is a row of small figures, and above these are, in the centre a *liṅga,* and on the sides of it representations of the gods Brahman and Vishṇu ; below the inscription are some cows and calves, and below these there is again a row of small figures, apparently fighting. I edit the inscription from an estampage, supplied to me some ago by Dr. Fleet.

......The inscription contains 11 lines of writing which covers a space of about 2’ broad by 11\* high, and is fairly well preserved. The **size of the letters** is about 1” in the upper lines, and rather less than ¾” in the lower ones. The **characters** are Nâgarî. The **language** is very incorrect Sanskṛit, and the whole is in prose. In respect of **orthography,** it will be sufficient to note that the consonant b, with perhaps one exception,⁸ is expressed by the sign for v, and that the dental sibilant is generally employed for the palatal, and the palatal once for the dental (in *sahaśravâhu,* l. 6). As regards grammar and lexicography, attention may especially be drawn to the Prâkṛit termination⁹ *u* in *saku,* l. 1, *dâsu,* l. 8, *tatparu* and *dhavalu,* l. 9, and *dvâdasu,* l. 10 ; to the employment of the words *chaḍaka,* l. 5, and *paṇatî,* ‘a great-grandson, ‘ and *nîtî,*‘a grandson,’ l. 8, which must have been taken from the author’s vernacular ; and to the peculiar construction of the numerals in line 10.

......Opening with the words ‘ôṁ, may it be well,’ and a date which will be considered below, the inscription (in lines 2-4) refers itself to the reign of victory of ‘the refuge of the universe, the favourite of Fortune and of the Earth,’ the *Mahârâjâdhirâja Paramêśvara Paramabhaṭṭâraka,* the glorious **Tribhuvanamalladêva,** the frontal ornament of the family of **Satyâśraya** and

......¹ With this phrase, for the employment of which there was no reason here, compare *râjâvalî- pûrrvam* in *Ind. Ant.* Vol. VI. p. 191, line of the inscription.  
......² *i.e. śrêshṭhinî.*  
......³ The superscript line of ô is very faint in the estampage.  
......⁴ *i.e. -prabhṛitayaḥ,* for -*prabhṛitayaḥ*  
......⁵ Read -*mûrttir=*.  
......⁶ *i.e. sûtradhâra-.*  
......⁷ See *Archæol. Survey of India,* Vol. VII. p. 142 ; and *Gazetteer of the Central Provinces,* p. 341.  
......⁸ In the name *Bôpapai* in line 8, if my reading of it is correct.  
......⁹ Compare *Ind. Ant.* Vol. XVI. p. 207.
