****BUGUDA PLATES OF MADAVAVARMAN.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

it is worded in every particular exactly like, and cities the same verses as, the copper-plate inscription of Bhôjadêva, published in the *Indian Antiquary,* Vol. VI. pp. 53-55.

......After two verses, glorifying the god Śiva (Vyômakêśa, Smarârâti) and invoking his blessings, **Jayasiṁhadêva,** described as stated above, gives notice (in lines 6-17) to all officials and to the resident *Paṭṭakila* and people of the village of **Bhîma,** which belonged to the **Maktulâ** village (group of) Forty-two in the **Pûrṇapathaka** *maṇḍala*, that, residing at **Dhârâ,** he granted the said village of **Bhîma** up to its proper boundaries (and inclusive of) the grass and pasture land, with the money-rent and share of the produce, with the *uparikara* and including all dues, to the Brâhmaṇas of the *paṭṭaśâlâ* at the holy **Amarêśvara,** for food and other purposes. And (in lines 18-21) he commands the resident *Paṭṭakila* and people to make over to the donees all due share of the produce, money-rent, and so forth, excepting what had been appropriated for gods and Brâhmaṇs ; and admonishes the rulers that may come after him, to assent to and preserve the religious gift thus conferred. This formal part of the grant is followed (in lines 21-28) by five of the customary benedictive and imprecatory verses. Line 29 gives, in figures only, the date,— **the 13th of the dark half of Âshâḍha of the year 1112,─** followed by the words *svayam=âjñâ*,¹— showing that the order about this grant was delivered to the people concerned by the king in person,— and by the words “bliss (and) good fortune.” And the inscription closes with words :— “This is the own sign-manual of the illustrious **Jayasiṁhaḍêva,”** which are also engraved (in line 15) at the bottom of the first plate.²

......I am unable to identify the village of **Bhîma,** nor can I suggest any identification for the **Maktulâ** village group of Forty-two or the **Pûrṇapathaka** *maṇḍala*. **Amarêśvara,** which in a copper-plate inscription of Arjunavarmadêva³ is called **Amarêśvaratîrtha,** is near the island of Mândhâtâ, on the southern bank of the Narmadâ.⁴ As regards the Brâhmaṇas of this place, in whose favour the grant was made, I do not know the meaning of the word *paṭṭaśâlâ,* which is compounded with the word *brâhmaṇêbhyaḥ* in line 14 and can only suggest that, similarly to *brahmapurî*, it may denote an establishment provided by the king’s favour for learned and pious Brâhmaṇas.

......**The date** of the grant, which must of course be referred to the Vikrama era, unfortunately does not admit of verification,⁵ and all that can be said with confidence about it, is, that for the expired *Chaitrâdi* year 1112, its European equivalent would fall in **A.D. 1055,** and for the expired *Kârttikâdi* year 1112, in **A.D. 1056.**

......The importance of this inscription lies, that, with the date A.D. 1055-56, it gives us the name of the **(Paramâra)** king who was then ruling at **Dhârâ,** and of whom no mention has yet been found in other inscriptions,⁶ and that, since this king **Jayasiṁhadêva** was the successor of **Bhôjadêva,** it furnishes a sure and fairly definite limit beyond which the reign of Bhôjadêva cannot have extended. According to both the stone and the copper-plate inscriptions hitherto published, Bhôjadêva was succeeded by his relative **Udayâditya ;** and it is perhaps correct to say that it was this king who put an end to the troublous state of affairs connected with Bhôjadêva’s death. But the omission of **Jayasiṁhadêva’s** name

......² In this respect, too, the plates resemble those of Bhôjadêva.

......⁴ See the *Gazetteer of the Central Provinces*, p. 258.  
......⁵ The possible equivalents for the expired *Chaitrâdi* year 1112 would be the 27th May and the 25th June (the day of *Dakshiṇâyana-saṁkrânti*), A.D. 1055 ; and for the expired Kârttikâdi year 1112, the 13th June and the 13th July, A.D. 1056.  
......⁶ See Ind. Ant. Vol. XIX. pp. 346-47 ; Professor Bühler’s edition of the Udaypur *Praśasti, Ep. Ind.* Vol. I. pp. 232-33 ; and my edition of the Nâgpur *Praśasti, ibid.* Vol. II. 181. Compare also Lassen’s *Indische Alterthumskunde,* Vol. III. pp. 855 and 1168-69, for the king Jayachandra or Jayânanda, who is reported to have ruled after Bhôjadêva.
