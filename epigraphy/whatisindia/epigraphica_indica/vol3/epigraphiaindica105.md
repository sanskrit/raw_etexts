****PAITHAN PLATES OF GOVINDA III.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

revolted against and defeated his brother, even though the latter, to protect himself, had formed an alliance with kings who otherwise were hostile to the Râshṭrakûṭa family.¹

......The formal part of this inscription, also, does not differ materially from the corresponding portions of other Râshṭrakûṭa grants. It records (in lines 42-62) that the king, being en-camped near **Pratishṭhâna,** and having bathed in the river **Gôdâvarî, on the occasion of a solar eclipse** **on the new-moon tithi of the dark half of Vaiśâkha in seven centuries of years, increased by sixteen, elapsed since the time of the Śaka king** (*i.e.* in the Śaka year 716), granted the village of **Limbârâmikâ,** situated in the **\[Sârâ\]kachchha** village group of Twelve in the **Pratishṭhâna** *bhukti,* to a number of Brâhmaṇas, for keeping up the five great sacrifices and other purposes. The boundaries of this village were, to the east the village **Samatîrthaka,** to the south the river **Gôdâvarî,** to the west a locality named **Brahmapurî,** and to the north the arable land (?)² of the village of **Dhôna** (?). The names and a description of the grantees are given in lines 47-54. There can be no doubt that their number originally was seven, but, as stated before, the inscription has here been seriously tampered with, for the purpose of reducing this number to four, and, perhaps, in order to substitute, at least in one case, another name for the one which was originally engraved. Of each of the grantees the inscription gave not only the father’s name and the *gôtra* and Vêdic school to which he belonged, but also the place of residence. But, with the exception of Pratishṭhâna which occurs in line 48, the names of these places are either altogether illegible, or so indistinct that they cannot be read with confidence. The *gôtras* mentioned are those of Vatsa, Pârâśara, Vaśishṭha, Saitêha (?), Hârîta (?), and Kâśyapa ; the Vêdic schools those of the Vâjins or Vâjasanêyins, Bahvṛichas, Taittirîyas, and Mâdhyaṁdinas.― Lines 63-72 contain the usual admonition to protect the donees in the enjoyment of this grant, and quote five of the customary benedictive and imprecatory verses ; and the concluding line 73 gives the names of the *dûtaka* and of the writer of the grant, both of which are so carelessly written that I am unable to say what they are.

......The **date** of the inscription― the new-moon *tithi* of the dark half of Vaiśâkha, of Śaka-Saṁvat 716― corresponds, for Śaka=Saṁvat 716 expired and the *amânta* Vaiśâkha, to **the 4th May, A.D. 794,** when there was **a total eclipse of the sun which was visible in India,** at 3 h. 48 m. after mean sunrise. It is, so far as I know, the earliest date from a genuine inscription of India proper which shows the *amânta* scheme of the lunar fortnights ; and it is ten years earlier than the oldest date³ which has been hitherto available for the reign of Gôvindarâja III.

......With the exception of **Pratishṭhâna** itself, I am unable to identify any of the **places** mentioned in this inscription.

......² The word of the original (in line 56) which I have doubtfully translated by ‘arable land,’ is *hala*. The ordinary meaning of this word is ‘plough,’ and it is also used as a measure of land ; but neither of these two meaning would be suitable here.  
......³ *viz*. the date of the Old-Kanarese grant of Śaka-Saṁvat 726, which works out properly only with the *pûrṇimânta* scheme of the lunar month ; *Ind. Ant.* Vol. XI. p. 126, and Vol. XVII. p. 141.
