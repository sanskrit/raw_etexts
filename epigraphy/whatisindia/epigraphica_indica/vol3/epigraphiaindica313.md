......¹ From Dr. Fleet’s accompanying photo-lithograph.  
......² Expressed by a symbol.  
......³ *Kaṭaka* may be either ‘a royal residence’ (*râjadhânî*) in general or the proper name of town. If the latter should be the case here,we ought to write –*Kaṭakê*. For instances where *vijaya* is prefixed to the names of towns see *Ind. Ant.* Vol. XVIII. p. 270.  
......⁴ This sign of punctuation is superfluous.  
......⁵ Here and it the following nouns up to –*jâti* the terminations of the Dative case are omitted.  
......⁶ I take the word intended to be *kshêtra-bhûmis=* ; the following *kûpâ* and *gṛihâ* are probably meant for *kûpâa*= and *gṛihâṇi..*

......⁷ Read *yach=cha na* and afterwards, for *sa cha, tach=cha* ; *yê* is the (Mâgadhî) Nom. sing. masc., used instead of the neuter ; *ṇa* is the Prâkṛit form of *na.*  
......⁸ Read *ºkêṇ=â*-.  
......⁹ Apparently for *yâvat-kṛitya, yâvat=kṛitvâ* ; and the whole phrase for the *ordinary â-chandr-ârka-târakarakaṁ yânat.  * ......¹⁰ This compound is used in the sense of the Instrumental case (-*âdibhiḥ*). The first word of it, *tusmâ*, I take to be equivalent to *yushmat.*  
......¹¹ The form, the sense of which the writer wished to express, seems to be *nirvâhyam,* and the meaning I take to be that of *paribhôgyam,* ‘to be enjoyed or possessed.’ Below, line 9, the root *vah* with the preposition *nir* is employed in the sense of ‘to carry out, to accomplish.’  
......¹² Apparently for *sadâ-sthityâ,* ‘in permanence or perpetuity ;’ the word occurs again in the next line.  
......¹³ Read *pradattam.*  
......¹⁴ Read *ºnîyam*.  
......¹⁵ i.e. *gôtrajasya kasyachid=anyasy=âpi* ; I understand the meaning to be : ‘Nobody (*i.e.* no ruler) either of my own family or any other (ruler) must follow his inclination ‘(to take away this property).  
......¹⁶ The two *aksharas kasya* were originally omitted and are engraved below the line.  
......¹⁷ Originally *sahastê* was engraved, but the sign of *ê* appears to have been struck out ; *sahasta* is of course *sva-hasta.* I am not sure about the exact meaning of this passage, but would suggest : *svahasta-parahastêna bhôktavyaṁ sadûsthity=âtr=êyam=avasthâ* ; ‘( the property granted) may be enjoyed by ( the donees’) own hands (*i.e.* by them personally) and (with their consent) by the hands of others ; this is the settlement (made) here in perpetuity.’ The first part of this clause would thus be equivalent to the *bhôktavyaṁ bhôjayitavyam* of other inscriptions. As regards the wording of the second part, *ostâ* I take to be the Mâgadhî equivalent of *avasthâ* ; and *attrâaṁ* probably is a mistake for *atterêaṁ,* which would stand for *attrêyaṁ*, as *vidhêa* does for *vidhêya* in line 9, below.  
......¹⁸ Originally *mâhârâjñî* was engraved.  
......¹⁹ Read –*grâmô*, and further on, agreeing with it, *sahitaḥ, samastaḥ, -grâmô*, and *ºkṛitaḥ*.  
......²⁰ This word and the next should have been put in the Instrumental case.  
......²¹ Read *kuṭumbikânâṁ,* for *ºkaiḥ.*  
......²² This should have been in the Dative case.  
......²³ What the writer wished to say, is probably *anyasya Palhojâtîyasya.*  
......²⁴ Read *kasyachit=.*
