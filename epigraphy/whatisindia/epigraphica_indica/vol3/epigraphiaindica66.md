.......(Line 57.) And Râmachandra has said :―

........\[Another of the customary verses.\]

......(V. 28.) Victorious is the illustrious **Trilôchanârya,** the excellent poet, the ornament of a race of poets, who composed the edict (*concerning*) **Immaḍilaṅka,** which had been granted by king **Ana-Vêma.**

......(V. 29.) Victorious is the poet, who was born from a race of poets, whose brilliant career is a blessing for the world, who is learned in the doctrine (*âgama*) of Śiva, who is the favourite of Śâradâ (Sarasvatî), (*and*) the stringing of whose words exhibits (*i.e* resembles) the sweet-sounding spray of drops of the impetuous Mandâkinî (Gaṅgâ), which dances on the coil of the matted hair of the great dancer (Śiva).

......(Line 65.) (*Obeisance to*) the blessed Tripurântaka **(Śiva) !** The signature (*vrâlu*) of **Ana-Vêmu.**

**No. 11.— COCHIN PLATES OF BHASKARA RAVIVARMAN.  
  
BY E. HULTZSCH, PH.D.**

......Two editions of this inscription appeared in the year 1844, one by Dr. Gundert,¹ the great Malayâḷam scholar who died only a few months ago in his native country, Würtemberg, and the other by the late Mr. Ellis.² To Mr. Ellis’ paper Sir (then Mr.) Walter Elliot added a tracing of the original copper-plates. In 1859 Kookel Keloo Nair published his own version of Dr. Gundert’s translation.³ Dr. Burnell next gave a translation which was based on the two first versions, and which was accompanied by a bronzed reproduction of the original.⁴ Lastly, Mr. Logan”s work on Malabar contains a reprint of Dr. Gundert’s translation.⁵ His Highness the Second Prince of Travancore, who takes a warm interest in historical research, was good enough to send me a set of fresh impressions, from which the Plate at page 72 was prepared. The subjoined transcript and translation, though containing little new, will be welcome to those who are unable to use Dr. Gundert’s and Mr. Ellis’ papers. The transcript follows that by Dr. Gundert.⁶ The translation also agrees generally with Dr. Gundert’s, though, in a few cases, Mr. Ellis’ explanations were adopted as more probable.

......The original of the inscription is in the possession **of the Jews at Kochchi** (Cochin). It is engraved on two copper-plates ; the second side of the second plate is blank. A hole for the ring on which the plates must have been strung, is visible on the impression of each plate ; but I have no information if this ring is still preserved and if it bears a seal. The character which is chiefly used in the document, is the **Chêra-Pâṇḍya** (Vaṭṭeluttu) alphabet. The only letter of this alphabet which calls for a special remark, is y. This letter has, throughout the plates, the same shape as in the **Tirunelli** grant ;⁷ but once, in *vâyanattâlum* (line 7), the totally

For the numerous misprints in Dr. Gundert’s paper, not the author, but the editors of the *Madras Journal* must be held responsible. One of these misprints, Coḍunrílúr (p. 120), has crept into *Hobson-Jôbson,* p. 211, *s.v.* Cranganore ; the correct from Koḍuṅṅallûr is given in Dr.Gundert’s *Malayâḷam Dictionary*, p. 303.
