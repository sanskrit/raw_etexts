****GANAPESVARAM INSCRIPTION OF GANAPATI.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Mantena-Guṇḍa, Tailapadêva, and Gôvinda-Daṇḍêśa,** and re-instated **Chôḍôdaya** (v. 6). The same four contemporaries of Prôla are referred to in the Anmakoṇḍa inscription, where, however, Mantena-Guṇḍa is called **Guṇḍa,** the lord of the city of **Mantrakûṭa.** Tailapadêva has been already identified by Dr. Fleet with the Western Châlukya king **Taila III.** Chôḍôdaya is mentioned four times in the Anmakoṇḍa inscription. Line 32 f. of that inscription reads as follows :― “Then he (Prôla), who had easily plundered his (Udaya’s) dominions in warfare, gave the kingdom (back) to king **Udaya.**” Verse 6 of the Gaṇapêśvaram inscription shows that Udaya is here meant for Chôḍôdaya. In lines 65 to 71 of the Anmakoṇḍa inscription, we are told that king **Chôḍôdaya** died out of fear of Prôla’s successor, **Rudra.** According to line 104 f. Rudra burnt **the city of Chôḍôdaya.** In line 107, Rudra is called “the only resort of **Padmâ** (or Lakshmî) who arose from the womb of the glittering milk-ocean of the race of **Kandûrôdaya-Chôḍa.**” **Udaya-Chôḍa** is evidently a transposed, but synonymous form of Chôḍôdaya. Further, I suspect that **Padmâ** has to be taken as the actual name of Chôḍôdaya’s daughter, whom Rudra married for political reasons, though he caused the death of her father and destroyed his city. Finally, **Kandûra** appears to have been the name of Chôḍôdaya’s capital. According to Dr. Oppert¹ “these are in the Nizâm’s territory and the neighbouring districts many places called Kandûru.” But I am not in a position to say which of these is to be identified with Kandûra.

......By his wife **Muppaladêvî,** or, as she is called in the Anmakoṇḍa inscription, Muppamadêvî, Prôla had two sons, **Rudra** and Mahâdêva (v. 7). Rudra succeeded his father on the throne (v. 8). He is said to have settled the inhabitants of towns which he had destroyed, at **Ôruṅgallu²** (Worangal) and to have established on the sites of those towns new colonies, in which he built temples of **Rudrêśvara** (v. 9). Rudra was succeeded by (his brother) **Mahâdêva** (v. 11), whose son by **Bayyâmbikâ** was **Gaṇapati** (v. 12).

......Verses 15 to 43 describe the descent of one of **Gaṇapati’s** officers, the general **Jâya or Jâyana.** The first person named is Bhîma (I.) of the race of **Ayya** (v. 16), who resided at **Kroyyûru³** in the country of **Velanâṇḍu⁴** (v. 17). His three sons by Rachyâmbikâ, Jilla, Nârâyaṇa (I.), and Sûraya, were in the service of king **Chôḍi** (v. 18). Jilla defeated a certain **Kannâradêva** and received in acknowledgement of this deed the dignity of general from the king (v. 19). At the command of king **Chôḍi,** the second brother, Nârâyaṇa (I.), fortified **Dvîpa,** *i.e.* **Talagaḍa**-Divi, which is fabled to have been created by the god Kuvêra (v. 20 f.). He also constructed tanks and temples at **Dvîpa** and at **Vaḍlakurru** (vv. 23-25). He received from king **Chôḍi** the lordship over **Dvîpa** and the **Goṇṭu** villages, and the title of general (v. 26 f.). The four sons of Nârâyaṇa (I.) by Nârâmbâ (I.) were Chôḍi,⁵ Bhîma (II.), Pinna-Chôḍi, and Bramma (v. 28). They served in the army of “the king who was the lord of the **Chôḍa** country” (v. 30). This king appears to be identical with, or a successor of, the previously mentioned king **Chôḍi** (vv. 18, 20, 27). He may be also connected with **Chôḍôdaya,** to whom both the Anmakoṇḍa and the Gaṇapêśvaram inscriptions refer as a contemporary of the two Kâkatîya kings Prôla and Rudra, and with **Kulôttuḍga-Chôḍa-Goṅka of Velanâṇḍu.⁶** The wife of Pinna-Chôḍi, the third of the four brothers, was Dâmâmbâ (v. 31). They had two daughters, Nârâmbâ (II.) and Pêramâmbâ, and three sons, Pṛithva, Jâya or Jâyana, and
