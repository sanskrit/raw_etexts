......¹ From the estampages and ink-impressions.— The numbering of the lines follows the version which is in the local characters. All differences between the two versions are shown in the following notes ; except that I have not thought it necessary to do more than draw attention here to the point that the Nâgarî version uses only the ordinary *l,* and nowhere has *ḷ.*  
......² In both versions, the first *ôm* is expressed by a plain symbol, and the second by the word itself in writing.  
......³ We have here evidently a verse, in the Âkṛiti group of metres, though the form in which it stands is not correct : the first two *pâdas* contain twenty-two feet, and are exactly uniform with each other ; the third *pâda*, however, contains twenty-three feet, and matches the preceding two in only the last seven feet ; and the fourth *pâda*, though it contains only twenty-two feet, is uniform with the first and second in only the first seven feet. The verse seems to me to have been quoted, with imperfect recollection, from some Śaiva poem, similar to the Vaishṇava *Gîta-Gôvinda.* And the third and fourth *pâdas* might be put right by adopting some such reading as *daśaśataraśmi-pâda-parivarddhita-kamala-ras-âtivarddhita-vikasita-puṇḍarîka-ruchimân sa jayatu Hara-Gauri-saṁgamaḥ.*

......⁴ The Nâgarî version (line 1) has *ºvâhu-parichumvita.*  
......⁵ Read *ºpayôdhara-sthaḷô* ; the following *a* of *aḷi* ought to have been elided, but was retained for the sake of the metre.— The Nâgarî version (lines 1-2) has *payôddharô* ; the other *payadharô*.  
......⁶ The hiatus here, which is in both versions, is intentional, for the sake of the metre.  
......⁷ The Nâgarî version (lines 2-3) has *viddhṛita*.  
......⁸ Read *ºmaṇḍaḷaṇḥ* ; *saṁdhi* being not proper at the end of the second *pâda*.  
......⁹ The Nâgarî version (line 3) has *parivarddhitta*.  
......¹⁰ The *î* of *gaurî* is shortened for the sake of the metre.  
......¹¹ In the version in local characters, the *ga* was at first omitted, and then was inserted below the line.  
......¹² The Nâgarî version (line 5) has, either *chchaluki*, for *chaluki* ; or possibly *chuluki*, with the subscript *u* of the first syllable damaged in such a way as to give the appearance of *chcha*.  
......¹³ Here, and all through, in the Nâgarî version *y* is not doubled after *r*.  
......¹⁴ Read *ºsuta iva*. The Nâgarî version (lines 5-6) makes the same mistake.  
......¹⁵ Read *ºratas=sadâ* ; or, as in the Nâgarî version (line 6), *ºrataḥ sadâ.*  
......¹⁶ Read *vṛikôdara iva.* The Nâgarî version (line 6) makes the same mistake.  
......¹⁷ Read *ºniravady-ôdâra*. The Nâgarî version (line 6) has the same peculiarity.  
......¹⁸ The Nâgarî version (line 7) has *ºpṛithivîvallabha,* correctly.  
......¹⁹ Read *ºbhaṭṭârakas=têna.*  
......²⁰ The Nâgarî version (line 8) has either *mâhâ*, or *maḥhâ*.  
......²¹ The Nâgarî version (line 9) has *pṛiyaḥ*.  
......²² Read *śry-anivâritaḥ.* The hiatus, and the omission of the *visarga*, are in both versions.  
......²³ The Nâgarî version (line 9) has *ºsâmaṁt*.  
......²⁴ The Nâgarî version (line 10) has *ºvimarddhanaḥ*.  
......²⁵ The Nâgarî version (line 10) has *ºpṛithivî*, correctly.
