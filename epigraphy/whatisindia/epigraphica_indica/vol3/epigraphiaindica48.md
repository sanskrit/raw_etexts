****MANDHATA PLATES OF JAYASIMHA OF DHARA.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**from other** inscriptions can be no reason for doubting the correctness and authenticity of the information conveyed by these copper-plates. In a similar manner, the name of Udayâditya’s immediate successor, **Lakshmadêva,** is omitted from all inscriptions except the Nâgpur *Praśasti* ; and that very Praśasti clearly intimates that some time elapsed between the reigns of Bhôjadêva and Udayâditya. The earliest and latest certain dates which we possess for Bhôjadêva, are Vikrama-Saṁvat 1078 = A.D. 1021, and Śaka-Saṁvat 964 = A.D. 1042-43, while for Udayâditya the only certain date is Vikrama-Saṁvat 1137 = A.D. 1080-81. For the interval between the two, our inscription now gives us a date in A.D. 1055-56, of the reign of Bhôjadêva’s successor **Jayasiṁhadêva.¹** How long this king may have ruled at Dhârâ, it is impossible to say at present. Probably his reign was not a long one ; and it also seems probable that Bhôjadêva’s reign had come to an end not very long before the date of this inscription.

......¹ With the date of the present inscription, it may be doubted whether the date which is furnished for Udayâditya by an inscription at Udaypur (Vikrama-Saṁvat 1116 = Śaka-Saṁvat 981 ; *Jour. Am. Or. Soc.* Vol. VII. p. 35), is really so valueless as it has been supposed to be.  
......² From an impression, prepared by Mr. Cousens and supplied to me by Dr. Hultzsch.  
......³ Expressed by a symbol.  
......⁴ Metre : Ślôka (Anushṭubh) ; and of the next verse.  
......⁵ I am not quite sure about the actual reading of the *akshara* in brackets. Originally z ![](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/epigraphica_indica/vol3/images/58.bmp)was engraved, but the proper right side of the ![](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/epigraphica_indica/vol3/images/57.bmp) seems to have been altered.

......⁶ This sign of punctuation is superfluous.  
......⁷ The *akshara* in brackets might possibly be read *kira*.  
......⁸ This sign of punctuation is superfluous.  
......⁹ Metre : Vasantatilakâ.
