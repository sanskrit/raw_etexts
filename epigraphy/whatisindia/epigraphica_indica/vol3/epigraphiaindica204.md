****SRAVANA-BELGOLA EPITAPH OF MALLISHENA.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

......(V. 44.) “Let them protect you, these loud shouts for help¹ of the ancient sage (*i.e.* Brahmâ) :— ‘Now this holy sage **Vâdirâja** eagerly takes away from my side the goddess of Speech, whose affection (*has become*) very strong through (*his*) long familiarity (*with her*). Ah ! Ah ! Look ! Look ! Is this the way of ascetics ?’”

......(V. 45.) Wise, endowed with superhuman qualities, (*and*) dispelling darkness (*or ignorance*) by the rays of true knowledge (*was*) he whose famous name commenced with the word **Śrî** and ended with **Vijaya.** The splendour of his fine moon-like toe-nails mingled with the dawn-like redness produced by the jewels on the head of the **Gaṅga** king.

......(Line 132.) NOTE.— For, this holy one was praised by the holy **Vâdirâjadêva** (*as follows*) :—

......(V. 46.) “All that double excellence of learning and penance, which, before, in the holy sage **Hêmasêna** had been brought to the highest pitch through very long application, must have devolved on **Śrîvijaya** when he occupied his chair. How else (*could he acquire*) such learning (*and*) such penance in a short time ?”

......(V. 47.) I worship that lord of sages, **Kamalabhadra,** who obtained fame on this (*earth*) by floods of sin-destroying virtues, (*and*) who possessed proficiency in learning (*but*) no conceit, brilliant penance (*but*) no fierceness, might (*but*) no pride.

......(V. 48.) I resort to him, in order to purify myself,— the extremely pure **Kamalabhadra,** (*who resembles*) an excellent lake, by the mere thought of which the mind of (*all*) good pilgrims (*or disciples*) on this (*earth*) becomes perfectly pure.

......(V. 49.) Let (*all those*) good men who are considered as learned on this (*earth*), praise that great scholar (*sûri*), who adorned (*i.e.* appropriately bore) the name **Dayâpâla,** to whom alone the title of *Paṇḍita* was suitable, the extremely fortunate one who, though the foremost of ascetics,² was resplendent with numerous ornaments of jewels, (*viz.*) virtues, (*and*) was embraced in this Kali (*age*) by the goddess of Speech with all (*her*) parts !

......(V. 50.) Victorious is the holy **Dayâpâladêva,** who subdued the pride of Cupid, who knew all sciences, who conquered all disputants, whose extremely pure fame pervaded the circle of (*all*) quarters, (*and*) whose feet were reddened by the jewels in the diadems of bowing kings.

......(V. 51.) Who is able to describe as “such and such” the ability of that ascetic **Śântidêva,** having worshipped whose pair of pure lotus-feet, the well-known **Poysaḷa** king **Vinayâditya** brought to the presence of the goddess of (*his*) kingdom (*other*) countries, which fulfilled (*his*) commands ? Rare indeed are (*men*) who possess such brilliant and great splendour.

......(V. 52.) Fortunate is that sage, on whom the **Pâṇḍya** king, who had received a wealth of knowledge through his favour,³ conferred the title “Lord” (*Svâmin*), (*and*) whose name **Śabdachaturmukha** was celebrated in the court of king **Âhavamalla.**

......(V. 53.) To be worshipped by those who desire (*their own*) welfare, is that lord of *Paṇḍitas,* **Guṇasêna,** the jewel of the beryl⁴ (*producing*) country near **Śrî-Miḷḷûra,⁵**

......¹ I had originally translated the adjective *abrahmaṇya-parâḥ* by ‘impious,’ Professor Kielhorn pointed out to me that it refers to the exclamation ‘*abrahmaṇyam* !’  
......² A similar *virôdhâbhâsa* occurs in verse 68, and gives rise to a joke at the expense of Brahmâ in verse 44.  
......³ *i.e.* who was converted to the Jaina religion.  
......⁴ *Viḍûrasâra* is synonymous with *vaiḍûrya* (or *vaidûrya*) and *viḍûraja* (or *vidûraja*). The only locality in Southern India, where beryls are found, is Padiyûr or Pattiyâli in the Dhârâpuram tâlukâ of the Coimbatore district ; see *Ind. Ant.* Vol. V. p. 237 ff.  
......⁵ There is a village named Mullûr in the Uḍipi tâlukâ of the South Canara district ; Mr. Sewell’s *Lists of Antiquities,* Vol. I. p. 232.
