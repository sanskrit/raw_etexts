****NALLUR GRANT OF HARIHARA II.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

known. In four cases the short *u* is marked in such a way that it might be mistaken for a conjunct *r,* viz. *pu°* (at the end of l. 19), *tulâ* and *purusha* (l. 36), and *Samudra* (l. 39). There are certain peculiar mistakes which repeat themselves in this inscription. In line 14, the long as well as the short *i* are attached to the *tt* of *pôttiṇê* (for *pôtriṇê*), and the same mistake recurs in connection with the *śr* of *śrî* in line 52. In *tadiyâ* (l. 11) and *pâlaniyô* (l. 89), the short i is used instead of the long *î*. To the *ṭî* of *kôṭîra* in line 15, and to the *si* of *vîra-si* in line 23, the sign of *â* is affixed in addition to the *î* and *i*, respectively. In *dâna* (l. 69) and *adâ°* (l. 70), the *d* has two signs of *â* affixed to it in each case. Both the vowels *ṛi* and *i* are attached to *d* and *r*, respectively, in *dṛisha* (l. 62) and *vṛitti* (l. 64). In some conjunct consonants of which the last element is *r*, and which are followed by a long *â,* the *r* is added to the sign of length instead of to the group itself. For instance, the *r* of *daṁshṭrâ* (l. 4), *âśîd-grâma* (l. 59), and *°drân* (l. 89), instead of being added to *shṭ, dg,* and *d* respectively, is connected with the sign of length in each case. The distinction between *s* and *a* is not clearly marked. The *s* of *bhôgôtsava* (l. 29) and of *siṁhâsana* (l. 33 f.), and the *a* of *abhujaṁga* (l. 24) and of *anivârita* (l. 39) are nearly identical. In *yad-daṁshṭrâ* (l. 9), *makaraṁdda* (l. 20), and *Muddaṇêna* (l. 83), the two *d*’s are written side by side without any attempt to indicate the *virâma*. Similar anomalies occur in lines 26 and 32. In the former case *h* and *m* are written side by side, and in the second case *tataparê* is written for *tatparê.* In line 19, we have a peculiar form of the letter *ja*. The right angle, which is usually attached to the middle of the vertical portion of the letter, is in this case affixed at the bottom. The double *tt* takes the place of *tr* in the following cases :― *pôttiṇê* (l. 14), *tattâśî°* (l. 59), *kaḷattâ°* (l. 61), *yatta* (l. 62), and *puttapauttâ°* (l. 68).

......Of mistakes due to wrong pronunciation, the following may be noted :― *vrishṭyâ* (l. 12) and *Vumâ* (l. 61) occur instead of *vṛishṭyâ* and *Umâ,* respectively. The dental sibilant is used for the palatal in *si* for *śrî* (ll. 23 and 72), in *Sâlivâhê* (l. 50f.) and in *srauta* for *śrauta* (l. 75). *Dh* occurs for *ddh* in *sidha* for *siddha* (l. 49), and *dhdh* for *ddh* in *sidhdha* (l. 66). **The lingual** *ḷ* occurs in the following Sanskṛit words :― *maṁgaḷa* (l. 22 f.), *kaḷâ* (l. 35), *âvaḷi* (l. 49), *kaḷatta* (l. 61), *chakravâḷa* (l. 79), and *yugaḷa* (l. 92). The Tamil name *Iḷaṅgôvil* has been changed to *Yaḷaṁgôvil* (l. 62). It remains to be noted here that the name of the father of Harihara II. is written *Bhuka* once (l. 23), and *Bhukka* throughout the rest of the present inscription, while in all other inscriptions which have been published, the name is spelt with the unaspirated *b* and double *k*.

......The language of the inscription is **Sanskṛit,** verse (ll. 2 to 37, and 50 to 92) and prose (ll. 1, 38 to 50, and 93). The first two verses are invocations addressed to Siva and to the boar-incarnation of Vishṇu, respectively, the third to Gaṇapati, and the fourth and fifth again to the boar-incarnation. The sixth verse refers to **the Moon,** and the seventh to his descendant **Yadu** and to the race of the **Yâdavas,** who sprang from the latter. The eighth mentions **Saṁgama (I.),** the first historical person of the **first Vijayanagara dynasty,** and the tenth his son **Bhukka** (*i.e.* **Bhukka I.**). Bhukka’s queen was **Gaurî** and their son **Harihara (II.)** (v. 14), in whose reign the present inscription is dated. A lengthy prose passage (ll. 38 to 50) consists of a list of the *birudas* of Harihara (II.). Verse 18 gives the date of the inscription, while verses 19 to 31 specify the village granted and the donees. Verse 33 again celebrates Harihara (II.), and verses 34 and 35 contain the names of the composer and of the engraver of the inscription. Then follow four of the gift made by him. As in other Vijayanagara inscriptions, the end of the document is marked by the name of the god *Śrî-Virûpâksha* in Kanarese characters.

......Of the history of the **Vijayanagara kings** we do not know so much as might be expected of a dynasty which rose to prominence only about the beginning of the 14th century of the Christian era. The earliest epigraphical record of this dynasty is the only known inscription of **Harihara I.,** in which he is called *Mahâmaṇḍalêśvara Pûrva-paśchima-samudr-âdhipati Śrî-Vîra-*
