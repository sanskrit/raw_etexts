****GANAPESVARAM INSCRIPTION OF GANAPATI.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nârâyaṇa (II.) (v. 32). At this time (the Kâkatîya) king **Gaṇgapati,** who had defeated the kings of **Chôḷa, Kaliṅga, Sêvaṇa,¹ Karṇâṭa, and Laṭâ,** conquered the country of Velanâṇḍu, together with **Dvîpa** (v. 34). Having taken to wife **Nârama** and **Pêrama** (*i.e.* Nârâmbâ II. and Pêramâmbâ of verse 32), he took their younger brother **Jâya** or **Jâyana** into his service (v. 36 f.) and appointed him general (v. 38). **Jâya had,** on a previous occasion, defeated a certain **Vairigôdhûmagharaṭṭa** (v. 41).

......The immediate object of the inscription is to record that the general **Jâya** built at **Dvîpa** a temple of Śiva, which he called **Gaṇapêśvara** or **Gaṇapatîśvara** in honour of his patron, king Gaṇapati (v. 44 f.), and the name of which survives to the present day in the hamlet of Gaṇapêśvaram. The date of the consecration of the temple was the *tithi* of **Gaurî** in the bright fortnight of **Vaiśâkha** of the **Śaka** year **1153,** which corresponded to the cyclic year **Khara** (v. 45). I am obliged to Mr. Dikshit for the following remarks on his date :─

......“The goddess Gaurî is supposed to have been born on the fourth *tithi* of Jyaishṭha, but is considered as the regent of the third *tithi*. Consequently, the “*tithi* of Gaurî” might be meant for the third or fourth *tithi*. Observances on honour of Gaurî are enjoined on both the third and the fourth *tithi* of some of the twelve months. One of these observances commences on the Chaitra *śukla tṛtîyâ* and ends on the Vaiśâkha *śukla tṛitîyâ.* This *tithi* ended in Śaka- Saṁvat 1153 expired, the Khara *saṁvatsara,* on **Monday, the 7th April, A.D. 1231,** at 11 *gh*. 10 *p*., and Vaiśâka *śukla chaturthî* ended on Tuesday, the 8th April, at 7 *gh.* 13 *p.* Ujjain mean-time.”

......The Telugu portion of the inscription (lines 121 to 135)² records that certain dues had to be paid by every boat touching at **Naṅgegaḍḍa** to the temple of **Gaṇapaṭîśvara** at Divi,³ and that **Jâyapa-Nâyaka** (*i.e.* Jâyana of the Sanskṛit portion) assigned the revenue of a number of villages to the same temple, and granted twenty-five cows, the milk of which was to be used for supplying ghee to a perpetual lamp.

......² To Mr. G. V. Ramamurti, of Parḷâ-Kimeḍi, I am indebted for the explanation of several Telugu terms.  
......³ Both Divi and Dvîpa, which occurs repeatedly in the Sanskṛit portion, refer to the village of Talagaḍa-Divi, near which the hamlet of Gaṇapêśvaram is situated. The form Divi must be derived from *divi,* which is a Telugu *tadbhava* of *dvîpa,* and which forms part of Pada-Divipura (*ante*, p. 82, note 2).

......⁷ *Râjatî* is a mistake, caused by the metre, for *râjastî.*
