****SATYAMANGALAM PLATES OF DEVARAYA II.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

from the ring-holes to the edges, and thus damaged some of the writing. With this exception, and except that four *aksharas* are broken away at the edges, the plates are well preserved.

......The **size of the letters** is about ¼’’. The **characters** are Nâgarî, similar to, but more modern than, those of the Gôrâkhpur copper-plate grant of Jayâdutya of Vijayapura.¹ The **language** is Sanskṛit. Lines 31-41 are in prose ; the rest of the inscription, excepting the introductory *ôṁ svasti,* is in verse. As regards **orthography,** the letter *b* is throughout denoted by the sign for *v* ; the guttural nasal is used instead of *anusvâra* before the palatal sibilant, in *aṅśubhiḥ*, line 2, *prâṅśur*, line 7, and in the word *vaṅśa*, in lines 14 and 19 ; and the vowel *ṛi* is employed instead of *ṛi* in *tṛibhuvana*, line 6, and *tṛiyârshêya* (for *triyârshêya = tryârshêya*), line 38. The language is simple, but not always correct ; and though the general sense is plain enough, it is in one or two passages impossible to construe the words properly, and to make out with certainty what the writer exactly meant to say.

......The **inscription** is one of the illustrious **Mâdhavavarman** (line 30), who, from his residence at **Kaiṅgôda** (line 29), informs his officials and the people generally that, on the occasion of **a solar eclipse,** he gave the village of **Puipiṇa** (line 36), which was in the **Khadira** *pâṭṭaka* of the **Guḍḍa** *vishaya,* to the *Bhaṭṭa* Vâmana (line 40), who was a son of Âdityadêva and grandson of Vâmana, and a student of the Taittirîya *charaṇa,* of the Harita *gôtra,* and with the threefold *pravara* Âṅgirasa, Âmbarîsha² and Yauvanâśva.

......After the words *ôṁ svasti,* the inscription opens with two verses, one of which invokes the protection of the god **Śaṁbhu** (Śiva), while the other glorifies the donor, here called the *Râjêndra* **Mâdhavêndra.** Verses 3-12 then give the genealogy of the donor. The first personage spoken of is **Pulindasêna,** ‘famous amongst the peoples of **Kaliṅga.’** He, although endowed with many excellent qualities (a lofty stature, strong arms, a broad chest, *etc.*), did not covet sovereignty for himself, but rather worshipped Brahman, in order that the god might create a fit ruler of the land. And Brahman granted his wish, and created, apparently out of a rock, the lord **Śailôdbhava** (verse 5), who became the founder of a distinguished family. In this family was born **Raṇabhîta** (verse 6) ; his son was the lord of the earth **Sainyabhîta** (verse 7) ; in his family **Yaśôbhîta** was born (verse 8) ; his son again was **Sainyabhîta** (verse 9) ; and his son was the powerful and pious prince **Mâdhavavarman** (verses 10-12). Beyond the indication that these chiefs ruled in the country of **Kaliṅga,** nothing of importance is reported of any of them. Verse 12 is followed by the part formal part of the grant, the contents of which have been given above. Here I would only add that the list of officials, in lines 31-33, is a fairly long one, and that it includes officials termed *antaraṅga, vaiśvâsika,* and *pattalaka,* who are not met with ordinarily. The formal part of the grant closes with the usual admonition not to disturb the donee in the enjoyment of the land granted to him, and is followed, in lines 42-49, by five of the customary benedictive and imprecatory verses. The second verse, and evidently the third, fourth and fifth too, are stated to be a quotation from the **Law of Manu** (*Mânava Dharma,* line 44 f.). Another verse informs us that the grant was written by **Upêndrasiṅgha,** the son of **Kuṇḍabhôgin,** remarked³ (?) by **Jayasiṅgha,** and engraved by **Daḍḍibhôgin.** The inscription closes with the statement that the *dûtaka* for this grant was the *pratihârin* **Gaṅgabhadra.**

......The inscription is **not dated,** and I have not found the names of any of the chiefs mentioned in it in other inscriptions ; nor am I able to identify the localities which are spoken of in this grant.

......¹ See *Ind. Ant.* Vol. XXI. p. 169.  
......² In the original this name is written *Aṁvarhasha* and *Amvarsha.*  
......³ The term of the original is *lâñchhita* ; I am not sure about the exact meaning of it. It occurs again in line 35 of the copper-plates of Vidyâdhara Bhañja, where Dr. Râjêndralâl Mitra has translated it by. ‘marked (sealed) ;’ see *Jour. Beng. As. Soc.* Vol. LVI. Part i. p. 159.
