......¹ Metre : Âryâ.  
......² Read °*ktair*=.  
......³ Metre : Ślôka (Anushṭubh) ; and of the next verse.  
......⁴ There are so many different marks on the plate here, and some of the letters are so indistinctly formed, that I am not all sure about the exact wording of the first half of this verse. Apparently the sense of the whole verse is, that Gôvindarâja treated the needy so liberally that they had no reason to apply to other princes for support. In the text given above, I have included in square brackets every letter the reading of which appears to me doubtful. Instead of *samâśritaḥ*, supposing this to be the correct reading, I should have expected *samâśritân*.  
......⁵ Metre : Âryâ.  
......⁶ Read –*jayaskandhâvâr*-.  
......⁷ Here one would have expected -*puṇya-yaśô-bhivṛidhayê*, which may have been engraved originally.― The following passage, up to the word *vrâhmaṇêbhyaḥ* in line 54, has been greatly tampered with, for the purpose of reducing the number of grantees, which originally was seven, to four. To effect this, the original writing of lines 50, 52 and 53, and of portions of lines 51 and 54, has been beaten in ; but sufficient traces remain of it, to make out the general sense of what has been effaced. Besides, to judge by the forms of the letters, the names of the grantee and of his place of residence, which occur in line 47, seem to have been engraved in the place of other names ; and in line 54 the word *chaturbhayaḥ* has been added at the beginning (where the original writing is effaced) to do duty for the word *saptabhayaḥ*, which originally preceded the word *vrâhmaṇêbhyaḥ*. That portion of the text which it has been sought to efface, I have included in double square brackets, but I have not been able to restore it completely.  
......⁸ Read –*Jayâditya*- (?).  
......⁹ Read –*putra*-.  
......¹⁰ The two *aksharas* at the end of this line I am unable to make out with certainty ; they look like *yava* or *hava*, or may be intended for *dêva*.  
......¹¹ Here, again, I must omit three *aksharas*, the first and second of which look like *pya* (or *shya*) and *vyâ* (or *chyâ*). Apparently the word *tathâ* is wanted here.  
......¹² Read *°châry-Ṛishi-.*  
......¹³ This name is quite clear in the engraving, but it can hardly be correct.  
......¹⁴ Read °*ṭa* \| *tathâ*.  
......¹⁵ Possibly, what is engraved may be *Takali*- ; and perhaps the word has been engraved in the place of another name
