**Takshaka ;** a very Kâmadêva with his **tiger-crest ;** the king of the **Sindhu country** (l. 42) ;¹ the spotless **Sinda** (l. 43) ; the ornament of **the Sindakuḷa,─** (*such was*) the illustrious **Nâgâditya.**

......Hail ! To Paratraya-Siṁharâśibhaṭṭa (l. 44), **on a Sunday which combined the Uttarâyaṇa-saṁkrânti and the Vyatîpâta (yôga),** having washed the feet of Paratraya-Siṁharâśi, **Nâgâtiyarasa** gave, for the god Sindêśvara, a field, of the measure of one thousand *matters* by the staff of **Pattiya-Mattaüra** (l. 45), of (the village of) **Kiriya-Siriüra.** The *aruvaṇa* on these thousand *mattars* is twelve *gadyâṇas.* And those who are in the state of being *Brahmachârins* shall manage the property.

**No. 34.─ KUNIYUR PLATES OF THE TIME OF VENKATA II. ;  
  
SAKA-SAMVAT 1556.  
  
BY H. KRISHNA SASTRI ; BANGALORE.**

......The copper-plates which bear this inscription, belong to a Brâhmaṇa resident of the village of **Kûniyûr** in the Ambâsamudram tâlukâ of the Tinnevelly district, and were sent to Dr. Hultzsch for examination by Mr. T. Varada Rao, Acting Head Assistant Collector of Tinnevelly, in December 1890. I edit the inscription from two sets of ink-impressions, which were kindly made over to me by Dr. Hultzsch, who has already noticed it briefly in his *Progress Report* for October 1890 to March 1891.³

......The original consists of seven plates, measuring 8¾ inches in height from the middle of the bottom to the middle of the semi-circular top, and 6½ inches in breadth between the two parallel sides, the height of which approaches to 5½ inches. The ring-hole, which is a little more than ½” in diameter, is bored just ¾” below the rounded top. “The plates are strung on a ring with the seal which contains the figure of a **boar** facing the left, the legend *Śrî-Veṁkaṭêśa,* and representations of the sun and the moon” (*loc. cit.*). The first and last of the seven plates bear writing only on the inner side, while the rest are writing on both sides. The second side of the first plate, where the inscription begins, is marked with the Telugu numeral ‘one’ to the proper right of the ring-hole, while the remaining plates are similarly and regularly numbered on their first sides. From the appearance of the impressions I infer that the original plates have raised rims, and that those letters at the beginning and end of lines, which are indistinct on the impressions, may be quite clear in the original.

......¹ ‘Sindhu’ is possibly a mistake for ‘Sinda.’  
......² Here we have *bîḍu,* ‘a temporary residence, a halting-place.’ It seems to have not so strong a meaning as *nelevîḍu,* of which of course it is a components.  
......³ Madras G. O. dated 10th June 1891, No. 452, Public, p. 6.
