****THE SIDDAPURA EDICTS OF ASOKA.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*savachhare,* ‘one year.’ The correct total of the period during which the Beloved of the gods declares himself to have been connected with the Buddhists, is thus about nine years. With respect to the other, equally or perhaps more important question, who the *Vyûtha* or *Vivutha* was and to what the numerals refer, the Śiddâpura inscriptions yield, as far as I can see, no positive results. I shall discuss these problems again in the *Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft,* and will note here only this much, that I still take the **Vivutha** to be the **Tathâgata,** and still refer the numerals to the number of years elapsed since the **Nirvâṇa.**

......¹ From inked estampages, received from Dr. Hultzsch.  
......² The *sa* is mutilated on the right, but the *u*-stroke is distinct.  
......³ Possibly *savachharaṁ,* as the indentation, taken for as *anusvâra,* is rather regular in its outlines.  
......⁴ The first syllable is damaged, but not *pâ,* as the photograph might seem to indicate.  
......⁵ The *ta* consists here of a semicircle, open below, and a vertical standing above it, in accordance with the practice prevailing in much later inscriptions.  
......⁶ Only the upper portions of the two *ma* have been preserved, and the second very imperfectly.  
......⁷ The *yu* is faintly visible on the impression. Read *ti*.  
......⁸ Read *me*.  
......⁹ The lower portions alone of *vaḍh* have been preserved.  
......¹⁰ The impression shows faint traces of the vertical stroke of the vowel *i.*  
......¹¹ The impression shows traces of a probably angular sign which was attached to the lower right of the *ta* and of the *anusvâra.* There is thus a presumption that the reading was *garutvaṁ* ; but *garutaṁ* is not absolutely excluded.
