****KOLHAPUR INSCRIPTION OF BHOJA II.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

that Tîravâḍa in Eḍenâḍa, which most probably is the Tiravâḍabîḍa of this inscription,¹ was the residence of Gaṇḍarâdityadêva.

......The second part of our inscription (lines 13-19) records that,— on **Friday, the first of the bright half of Âśvija (or Âśvina) of the Paridhâvin year, when 1114 years had elapsed since the time of Śaka king,─** the *Nâyaka* Kâliyaṇa, a son of the above-mentioned *Nâyaka* Lôkaṇa, gave to the same four Brâhmaṇas some land and other property at the *agrahâra* village of **Pauva,** situated in **Tâluragekholla,** for the purpose of feeding the Brâhmaṇas at a *sattra* or alms-house established by \[his mother Pômâkauvâ ?\]. The property so granted is described as ‘one largest (*uttama*) *nivarttana* (and) one smallest (*kanishṭha*) *nivarttana,* making thus half a *vṛitti* (of land) ; connected with it, half of a first-rate (*uttama*) house and one middle-sized (*madhyama*) house, and a *khaḍavalaka* connected with them ;’ and, so far as I can make out from the text, this property had originally belonged to one Lakhumaṇaghaisâsa,² who had sold it to the traders of the village, of whom it was afterwards purchased by Kâliyaṇa.

......**The date of this donation does not work out satisfactorily ;** for the first of the bright half of Âśvina of Śaka-Saṁvat 1114, which was the year Paridhâvin, correcponds to the 9th September,³ A.D. 1192, which was a Wednesday, note a Friday. **The localities** I am unable to identity.

......Finally, our inscription (in lines 19-23) records that, **on Friday, the fifth lunar day of the bright half of Phâlguna of the Pramâdin year,** the same *Nâyaka* Kâliyaṇa gave to the same four Brâhmaṇas some land, which he had purchased of Mâyiṁkauvâ, the daughter’s daughter of Sômêśvarabhaṭṭa, a student of the Sâmavêda, for the purpose of feeding the pupils at a school⁴ established for the study of the Vêdas.

......The year Pramâdin of this **date** should be Śaka-Saṁvat 1115 expired, and for this year the given date corresponds to **Friday, the 28th February, A.D. 1194,** when the 5th *tithi* of the bright half ended 21 h. 44 m. after mean sunrise.

......¹ A place ‘Bir’ or ‘Beed’ lies 7½ miles south-west of Kôlhâpur ; and, in case this were the Tiravâḍabîḍa of our inscription, I would identify Kopparavâḍa with the village ‘Kopurda’ of the maps, which is about 2 miles north by west of ‘Bir.’  
......² The word *khaddiya*\[*ṁ* ?\], which in line 16 precedes this name, I do not understand.  
......³ The first *tithi* of the bright half ended about 11 h. 12 m. after mean sunrise of this day.  
......⁴ The original, in line 21, has the word \[*khô* ?\]*ḍakâ* which I do not understand.  
......⁵ From an impression, supplied to me by Dr. Fleet.  
......⁶ Originally *ºdêvô* was engraved.  
......⁷ Here and in other places below, the rules of *saṁdhi* have not been observed.  
......⁸ It is difficult to say whether the last but one word of this compound should be read *parichâla* or *parivâla.*  
I take it to be *parichâla,* employed in the sense of *parichâra,* i.e. *pûjâ* ; compare the use of the word *pûjâ* in l. 5.  
......⁹ Read -*ântarggata*.  
......¹⁰ Read -*âbhyantarê*.
