****GANAPESVARAM INSCRIPTION OF GANAPATI.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

......(V. 21.) At the command of (*his*) lord, he converted this **Dvîpa,** which Dhanada (Kuvêra) had formerly created at the junction of the **Kṛishṇavêṇî** (*i.e.* the Kṛishṇâ river) and the salt-sea,¹ into a fortress which was hard to be entered by enemies (*and*) pleasant to the residents.

......(V. 22.) He covered **Dvîpa,** which had been previously uninhabitable by men, into a city which was fit for residence of a king, as it shone with whitewashed mansions, upstair-houses, paces, towers, and lofty ramparts ; as its site was adorned with extensive gardens which teemed with various flowers and fruits ; (*and*) as its glittering fields of paddy and sugar-cane were inundated by the water of brimful tanks in the neighbourhood.

......(V. 23.) He constructed in this **Dvîpa** the **Chôḍasamudra** tank and the **Chôḍêśvara** temple, (*both of were called*) after the name of (*his*) lord, and the **Bhîmêśvara** temple, (*which was called*) after the name of (*his*) father.

......(V. 24.) He built in the same (*place*) lovely temples of Vishṇu and of Karâla-Bhairava, of Baṇḍuladêvî (*and*) of Mahâkâlî.

......(V. 25) Further, he constructed in the village called **Vaḍlakurru** the **Bhîmasamudra** tank, (*and*) a lovely temple of Śiva, called **Bhîmêśvara,** (*both of which were*) named after (*his*) father.

......(V. 26.) The lord, who was pleased with (*his*) valour, granted to this **Nârâyaṇa** the lordship over **Dvîpa** and the mastership of the **Goṇṭu** villages (*palli*).

......(V. 27.) Knowing (*him to be*) a conqueror of wealth, a great hero, (*and*) able to govern (*his*) country, king **Chôḍi** also appointed the same **Nârâyaṇa** (*his*) general.

......(V. 28.) To this renowned **Nârâyaṇa** were born by **Nârâmbâ** four sons, resplendent as the sun,― **Chôḍi, Bhîma,** the renowned **Pinna-Chôḍi,** and **Bramma** by name.

......(V. 29.) These four excellent warriors resemble the (*four*) oceans, as they are the refuge of Brâhmaṇas (*Bâḍaba*), (*just as the oceans are the seats of the submarine fire*) ; they resemble the (*four*) expedients of the king, as they accomplish (*his*) objects ; (*and*) they resemble the (*four*) arms of (Vishṇu) the enemy of Mura, as they embrace Fortune.

......(V. 30.) (*These*) four chiefs of warriors procured by the strength of (*their*) arms the victory over the four quarters to the king who was the lord of the **Chôḍa** country.

......(V. 31.) As Śrî (*is the wife*) of Vishṇu, Gir (Sarasvatî) of the lotus-born (Brahmâ), the mountain-daughter (Pârvatî) of Śaṁbhu (Śiva), **Rati of Kâma,** Śachî of (Indra) the lord of the gods, Ushâ of the Sun, (*and*) Rôhiṇî of the Moon,― the chaste wife of the virtuous lord, the glorious **Pinna-Chôḍi, was Dâmâmbâ,** who fulfilled the desires of supplicants, (*as*) the celestial cow.

......(V. 32.) This couple² had two daughters, **Nârâmbâ and Pêramâmbâ,** (*and*) three sons, called **Pṛithva, Jâya, and Nârâyaṇa.**

......(V. 33.) Though the middlemost of these three brothers, the general **Jâya** is the chief (*of them*) in ability, just as (Arjuna) the middlemost of the Pâṇḍavas.

......(V. 34.) At this time the ornament of princes, king **Gaṇapati,** having easily subdued the lords of **Chôḷa, Kaliṅga, Sêvaṇa,** great **Karṇâṭa,** and **Lâṭa,** (*and*) ruling the territory between the Southern ocean and the **Vindhya** mountain, made the whole country of **Velanâṇḍu,** together with **Dvîpa,** subject to himself.

......(V. 35.) The king carried to his city a mass of handsome women, fine men, excellent elephants and horses, and various kinds of precious stones, which he had seized throughout this country of **Velanîṇḍu.**
