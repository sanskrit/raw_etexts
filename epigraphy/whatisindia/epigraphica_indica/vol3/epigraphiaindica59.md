**No. 10.─ VANAPALLI PLATES OF ANNA-VEMA.─ SAKA-SAMVAT 1300.  
  
BY E. HULTZSCH, PH.D.**

......The original of this inscription was "found by a workman while excavating some earth in an old site" in the village of **Vanapalli** in the Amalâpuram tâlukâ of the Gôdâvarî district. The find came to the notice of Mr. P. V. S. Gopalam, Pleader, Cocanada, who reported it to the Superintendent, Archæological Survey, Madras, on the 23rd May 1892. The plates were subsequently presented to Government by their owner, Vissapragada Kṛishṇayya, and are now deposited in the **Madras Museum.**

......The inscription is engraved on three copper-plates of 10¼ by 5½ inches. The rims are slightly raised for the protection of the writing. The preservation of the plates is fairly good ; on plates i.*b*, ii.*b*, and iii.*a*, some letters are partially eaten away by verdigris. The three plates are strung on a copper ring, which measures about 3¾ inches in diameter, and about 7/16 inch in thickness. It is not soldered and can be detached from the plates by bending it asunder. Instead of the usual seal, the ring bears a well-carved recumbent figure of the sacred bull **Nandi,** which is about 1⅛ inch long, and placed on a plain pedestal.— The alphabet of the inscription is **Telugu,** and the language **Sanskṛit.** With the exception of a few words in lines 1, 49, 53, 57, f. and 65, the whole of the text is in verse. The signature of the king at the end of the document is in the Telugu language.— As regards **orthography,** the writer of the inscription follows the same system which is observed in other inscriptions from the Telugu and Kanarese countries. Thus, *dhdh* is writtern instead of *ddh*, if the letter *dh* is doubled either after *r* ( *e.g.* in *ardhdha* for *ardha,* l. 47) or through *saṁdhi* (*e.g.* in *sidhadha* for *siddha,* l. 21, and *udhdharan* for *uddharan*, l. 1). Similarly, *chchh* takes the place of *chchh* (*e.g.* in *châmara-chhchhatra* for *châmara-chchhattra,* l. 35 f.). The letters *k, g, ḍ, t, d, dh,* and *v* are sometimes doubled after an *anusvâra* (*e.g.* in *laṁkka,* ll. 48, 52 and 61 ; *aṁggaṇa* l. 50 ; *gaṁḍḍa,* l. 27 ; *viṁddaṁttê,* l. 37 ; *baṁdhdhu,* l. 26 ; and *saṁvvatsara,* l. 41). A superfluous *anusvâra* is sometimes inserted before double *m,* before double *n,* or before *n* followed by a consonant (*e.g.* in *Iṁmmaḍi*, ll. 42 and 52 ; *Aṁnna* for *Anna,* l. 40 ; and *sâmâṁnya* for *sâmânya,* l. 58), Further irregularities are,— *braṁhma* for *brahma* (l. 56), *dhaṁrmma* for *dharma* (l. 58), *siṁhvâsana* or *sihvâsana* for *siṁhâsana* (ll. 29, 30 and 38), *pâlaniyya* for (l. 59), and *uchchatê* for *uchyatê* (l. 57). The unaspirated letter takes the place of the aspirate (*e.g.* in *palaka* for *phalaka,* l. 31, and *bima* for *bhîma,* l. 34) ; the sonant the place of the surd (*e.g.* in *adha* for *atha*, ll. 49 and 53), and *vice versâ* (*e.g.* in *phâla* for *bhâla,* l. 7) ; and the dental *n* the place of the lingual *ṇ* after *r* (in *varnna* for *varṇa,* l. 9, *arnnava* for *arṇava,* l. 25, and *nirnaya* for *nirṇaya,* l. 49).

......The plates record a grant by a member of the so-called **Reḍḍi** dynasty of **Koṇḍavîḍu,¹** a hill-fort in the Narasarâvupêṭa tâlukâ of the Kistna district.² The inscription opens with invocations of Vishṇu in his Boar-incarnation (verse 1), Gaṇapati (v. 2), and the moon on the head of Śiva (v. 3). It then refers to the creation of the world by Brahmâ at the command of Vishṇu (v. 4), and to **the fourth (or Śûdra) caste,** which, like the river Gaṅgâ, was produced from the foot of Vishṇu (v. 5). A member of this caste was king **Prôla** (v. 6), who must not be confounded with the Kâkatîya king of the same name.³ His son was king **Vêma** (v. 7), who built a flight of steps and a hall at **Srîśailam** (v. 10), the well-known Śaiva shrine in the Karṇûl district.⁴ Vêma had two sons, **Anna-Vôta** (v. 11) and **Anna- Vêma**
