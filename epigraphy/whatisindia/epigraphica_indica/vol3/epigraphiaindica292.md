**No. 40.─ KHAREPATAN PLATES OF RATTARAJA ;  
  
SAKA-SAMVAT 930.  
  
BY F. KIELHORN, PH. D., LL.D., C.I.E. ; GÖTTINGEN.**

......These plates were found, rather more than fifty years ago, by a Brâhmaṇa of **Khârêpâṭaṇ,** a town in the Dêvagaḍ, tâlukâ of the Ratnâgiri district of the Bombay Presidency ; and the inscription which they contain has been already published, by Bal Gangadhar Sastri, in the *Journal, Bombay Branch, R. A. S.,* Vol. I. p. 209 ff. I now re-edit it from an excellent impression, prepared by Dr. Fleet.

......These are **four copper-plates,** the second and third of which are engraved on both sides, while the others are so on one side only. They are marked with the Nâgarî numeral figures from 1 to 4, which are engraved on the right margin of the second side of the first, second and third plates, and of the first side of the last. Each plate measures from 7¾” to 7⅞” broad by about 4⅜” high. The pltes are strung on a circular **ring,** about ¼” thick and 2⅛” in diameter, which had not been cut when this record came into Dr. Fleet’s hands. As will be seen from the accompanying photo-lithograph, this ring has soldered on it an **image** of the mythical

......¹ This translation of *punta,* which usually means ‘a path,’ is suggested by the context. Probably the boundaries of Muppalle and of the villages mentioned subseqyently were marked by, and used as, cart-tracks.  
......² *Meṭṭu* is the same as *meṭṭa,* on which see Brown’s *Telugu Dictionary.*  
......³ *i.e.* ‘Mêḍitâpa near Sêḍakôḍu.’  
......⁴ To Mr. G. V. Ramamurti I am indebted for the correction of several mistakes in the translation of the Telugu portion.
