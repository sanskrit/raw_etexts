......(V. 8.) In the absence of (*his*) father,¹ the earth was ruled by king **Rudra,** the only hero in the world, the mighty forest-fire of whose valour burnt the crowd of rival kings, as a jungle.

......(V. 9.) The towns which he had rased to the ground, were known (*only*) by the quarters² which (*he*) founded in the city of **Ôruṅgallu** under their respective names, and peopled with their respective inhabitants ; while in these name same towns, which had been made his own, (*he*) built celebrated temples, named **Śrî-Rudrêśvara,** and settled fresh inhabitants.

......(V. 10.) As a father (*his*) children, this king made (*his*) subjects prosper by nourishing, gladdening, punishing, protecting (*and*) fondling (*them*).

......(V. 11.) After king **Rudra** had gone to heaven, the earth was cherished by king **Mahâdêva,** the rising sun of whose extinguished the light of (*other*) kings, as of stars.

......(V. 12.) To this great king **Mahâdêva** was born by **Bayyâmbikâ** the brilliant lord **Gaṇapati,** the light of (*his*) race, whose hands were able to bear the whole (*burden*) of the earth.

......(V. 13.) In the points of the horizon are spreading the moon-white creepers of fame, which have grown on the battle-fields that were flooded with the showers of the rutting-juice, dripping from the temples of his furious lordly elephants ; repeatedly ploughed by the hard hoots of (*his*) galloping tall steeds ; (*and*) covered³ with the seed of masses of pearls, dropping from the heads of the elephants of (*his*) enemies.

......(V. 16.) In this Kali (*age*) was produced from the renowned race of **Ayya** the valorous **Bhîma,** who chastised those enemies who were hard to be managed, (*and*) easily fought those who were hard to be overcome.⁴

......(V. 17.) This **Bhîma,** who equaled Dhanada (Kuvêra), caused the residence of (*his*) race, the village named **Kroyyûru** in the country of **Velanâṇḍu,** the ornament of the earth, to equal (Kuvêra’s *city*) Alakâ in wealth.

......(V. 18.) To him were born by **Râchyâmbikâ** three (*sons*), named **Jilla, Nârâyaṇa,** and **Sûraya,** by whom, as by the (*three*) constituents of (*his*) power,⁵ king Chôḍi overcame (*all his*) enemies on earth.
