****ALAMPUNDI PLATE OF VIRUPAKSHA.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

rendered possible in these alphabets, and are of frequent occurrence in Grantha and Tamiḷ inscriptions.¹ Another graphical peculiarity of the Âlampûṇḍi plate deserves to be noted. The consonant group *nr* of the Tamil names *Palakunra* (l. 15) and *tânri* (l. 23) is, in the absence of Grantha letters to represent it, denoted by the group *ṇr,* as it would be vulgarly pronounced even now. The language of the subjoined inscription is incorrect **Sanskṛit,** verse (ll. 1 to 22, and 26 to 33) and prose (ll. 1, 22 to 26, and 34).

......The first and second verses of the inscription contain invocations addressed to the Boar-incarnation of Vishṇu and to the goddess of the Earth, respectively. The third verse refers to **Bukkarâja (I.),** who belonged to the **race of the Moon,** and was the son of **Saṁgama (I.)** by **Kâmâkshî.** Bukka’s son was king **Harihara (II.)** who, as in other inscription,² is said to have performed “the sixteen great gifts” (verse 4) . Harihara (II.) married **Mallâdêvi,** who belonged to the family of **Râmadêva ;** and their son was **Virûpâksha** (v. 5), who conquered the kings of **Tuṇḍîra,³ Chôḷa and Pâṇḍya,** and the **Siṁhalas,** and presented the booty of his wars to his father (v. 6). **On the day of the Pushya-saṁkrânti** of the year **Raktâkshin** (v. 8), which corresponded to the **Śaka year 1305,⁴** king **Virûpâksha** (v. 7) granted to certain unnamed Brâhmaṇas of various *gôtras* the village of **Âlampûṇḍi** (v. 9). This village had been the object of a previous grant by **Harihara (II.)** (v. 9) and had then received the surname **Jannâmbikâbdhi** (v. 10). The pronouns *mama* and *mayâ* in lines 17 and 21 show both Harihara’s previous grant and the present donation of Virûpâksha were made at the instance of a princess who was the sister of Harihara (II.) (v. 9) and, consequently, the paternal aunt of Virûpâksha, and whose name must have been **Jannâmbikâ,** because the village of Âlampûṇḍi received the surname Jannâmbikâbdhi **(*i.e.* Jannâmbikâ-samudram)⁵** after her own name. The description of the boundaries of the granted village is contained in lines 22 to 26. Then follow three of the customary imprecatory verses. The inscription ends with the name *Śrî-Harihara.*

......The Âlampûṇḍi plate would add considerably to our genuineness of the history of the first **Vijayanagara dynasty,** if we could be quite sure of the genuineness of the plate. As in other inscriptions of this dynasty, the first historical person is said to have been **Saṁgama (I.).** The Âlampûṇḍi plate is the only inscription which informs us of the name of Saṁgama’s queen, *viz.* **Kâmâkshî.** According to the same plate the queen of Harihara II. was **Mallâdêvî.** The Satyamanṅgalam plates of Dêvarâya II. give the name of Harihara’s queen as **Malâmbikâ.⁶** As the two names Mallâdêvî and Malâmbikâ are very similar, we may, for the present, consider them as identical. The Âlampûṇdi plate adds that Mallâdêvî belonged to the family of Râmadêva. It is not impossible that Mallâdêvî was related to the Yâdava king Râmachandra, who was also called **Râmadêva,** and who reigned from Śaka-Saṁvat 1193 to 1230.⁷ It is from the present inscription that we first learn that Harihara II. had a sister called **Jannâmbikâ** and a son called **Virûpâksha,** who is reported to have made extensive conquests in the south, and whom his father appears to have placed in charge of at least a portion of the South Arcot district. The date of the grant of Virûpâksha (Śaka-Saṁvat 1305 for 1307, the Raktâkshi *saṁvatsara*) is a few years later than the accession of Harihara II.⁸ In referring a previous grant of the village of Âlampûṇḍi by **Harihara II.** himself, the inscription implies that the latter was ruling over a portion of the modern South Arcot district even before Śaka-Saṁvat

......¹ In the Tamil inscriptions contained in Volume I. of Dr. Hultzsch’s *South-Indian Inscription,* especially in the comparatively modern ones among them, several instances of this peculiarity occur on each page ; see, *e.g.,* page 72, where there are no less than nine cases.  
......² *ante,* p. 116.  
......³ On this name see *ante,* p. 119, note 6.  
......⁴ The Raktâkshin year does not correspond to Śaka-Saṁvat 1305, but to 1307 current.  
......⁵ *Abdhi* is a more poetical synonym of *samudra,* a frequent ending of village names ; hence the actual surname was probably Jannâmbikâsamudram.  
......⁶ *ante,* p. 37, verse 9.  
......⁷ Dr. Fleet’s *Kanarese Dynasties,* p. 71.  
......⁸ Harihara II. must have ascended the throne between Śaka-Saṁvat 1293 and 1301 ; *ante,* p. 115, note 11.
