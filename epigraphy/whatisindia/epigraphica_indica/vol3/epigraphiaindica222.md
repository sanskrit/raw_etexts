****PARLA-KIMEDI PLATES OF VAJRAHASTA.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

my inability of identifying any of the localities mentioned,― I do not fully understand. To the east of Hossaṇḍi was **Gûlaḍḍa,** and to the south-east **Kuravâgaḍḍa,** apparently two villages. To the south and south-west were a water-pond and the triangular (?) boundary-line of (the villages ?) **Vapavâṭa, Chitragummî,** and **Hommaṇḍî.** To the west lay (the village ?) **Śêluśêlâgaḍḍî, the Paluṅga** hill, and two boulders described as *araṁgaṁ-patthara* and *bhaduvalâ- patthara.*¹ On the north-western corner was the **Kaurâ** river and a *suliyâ* (?) rock as far as (the village ?) **Asuravâli.** To the north lay the village of **Nanîṇichaḍḍâ,** and a rock in the middle of a valley ;² and to the north-east (the village ?) **Khaṇḍaddâ** as far as **Gulaḍḍâ,** which must be the Gûlaḍḍa previously mentioned.― This account of the boundaries is followed, in lines 21-22, by the statement that the official in charge or headman (? *pâlaka*) of the village, so granted, (at the time) was the illustrious **Ugrakhêdirâja,³** born in the Nidusanti clan, and called ‘the ornament of the spotless family of the **Kadambas.’**

......Lines 23-26 contain the usual admonition not to interfere with this donation, and cite two of the ordinary imprecatory verses, here ascribed to Vyâsa. Line 27 records, in another verse, that the *Âjñapti*⁴ (or *dûtaka*) of this grant (*dharma*) was Vachchhapayya of the Kâyastha family, a minister of **Dâraparâja.** And the inscription ends with the statement that it was written by the *Mahâsaṁdhivigrahin* Drôṇâchârya, and engraved by the artizan Naṁkañchyêmâchari.

......The inscription contains **no date,** but it would in my opinion, on mere palæographical grounds, have to be assigned to about the 11th century A.D. Now the Vizagapatam copper-plate grants of Anantavarma-Chôḍagaṅgadêva⁵ mention five Ganga kings named Vajrahasta ; and since the latest of them, **Vajrahastadêva V.,** the grandfather of Anantavarma-Chôḍagaṅga who was anointed king on the 17th February, A.D. 1078, must have ruled about A.D. 1035-1070, it does not seem to me at all improbable that he may be the Vajrahastadêva in whose reign was made the donation which is recorded in our inscription.

......Of **the localities** mentioned in this inscription, the town **Kaliṅgânagara** (or Kaliṅganagara)⁶ and the mountain **Mahêndra** are often spoken of in other inscriptions of the same family, and well known to us. The other localities referred to I have not been able to identify.

......I have already stated that these copper-plates contain some **additional writing,** apparently of a later date, on the first side of the first plate and on the second side of the third plate. On the proper left half of the second side of the third plate there are four lines in incorrect Sanskṛit, in southern Nâgarî characters, which evidently have not been written by the writer of the inscription described above. The exact meaning of these lines I cannot make out, but it would seem to me that they record a donation, by means of a copper-plate grant, of the village **Homaṇḍi** (called Hommaṇḍî in l. 17 of the preceding inscription) by a *Râṇaka* **Udayakhêḍin.** A transcript of the four lines would be as follows :―  
..............................Râṇaka-śrî-Udaya (?)khêḍi kêm\[â ?\]k\[ô ?\]  
..............................maṇḍi yâ(?)vad(?)vaḍâ grâma Homaṇḍi  
..............................pravêsa tâmvra-sâsana(?) dataḥ chatur-â-  
..............................ghaṭâ-simâsandhi-prayântaḥ.

......Regarding the endorsement of four lines on the first side of the first plate, nothing can be said but that it is not in Sanskṛit and that, in line 3, it refers to **Homaṇḍi.**

......¹ *Patthara* would of course be the Sanskṛit *prastara,* ‘a stone, rock.’  
......² \[According to Brown’s *Telugu Dictionary, loṅka* means ‘a dell.’― E. H.\]  
......³ Compare the name *Dharmakhêdin* in *Ind. Ant.* Vol. XIII. p. 145, l. 12.  
......⁴ For the employment of this term compare *Ind. Ant.* Vol. VII. p. 17, l. 63 ; XII. p. 93, l. 60 ; XIII. p. 56, l. 25 ; p. 138, l. 28 ; p. 250. l. 35 ; XIV. p. 55, l. 113 ; XIX. p. 433, l. 114 ; XX. p. 17. l. 20 ; p. 106, l. 28 ; p. 471, l. 51.  
......⁵ See *Ind. Ant*. Vol. XVIII. pp. 164, 170-171, and 175.
