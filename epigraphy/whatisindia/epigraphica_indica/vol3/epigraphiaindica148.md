****UNAMANJERI PLATES OF ACHYUTARAYA.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **orthography** calls for few remarks. The palatal sibilant is five times employed for the dental (*e.g.* in *babhâśê*, l. 19), and once (in *tithiśv*=, l. 63) for the lingual ; and the dental sibilant twice for the palatal (in *aṁburâsî*, l. 47, and *visva*, l, 117), and once (in *nisphalaṁ*, l. 193) for the lingual. The sign of *visarga* is nine times wrongly omitted, mostly before the word *śrî*. And *b* is three times used instead of *bh*, in *tapôbir and buja*, l. 7, and *mahîbujâṁ*, l. 12. Besides we need only notice here that the word *Paṅktiratha* ( = Daśaratha) is spelt *Paṅtiratha*, in l. 24, and *tâmra tâṁmra*, in lines 188 and 190.— Of Sanskṛit words which either are not given by the dictionaries, or have as yet been met with only in lexicographical works, our text only offers *kâpâlikâ*, ‘a cloud (of dust),’ l. 48, *Pûshaja*, ‘the son of the Sun,’ *i.e.* Karṇa, and *aṁhati*, ‘a gift,’ the two last in the *biruda Pûshaja-darpa-hṛid-aṁhati-śauṁḍa,* ‘fond of bestowing gifts which take away the pride of Karṇa,’ in line 81. Like other inscriptions of the same dynasty,¹ this one also contains the Kanarese *birudas Bhâshege-tappuva-râyara-gaṁḍaḥ,* ‘the disgracer of those kings who break their word,’ in l. 80,and *Mûru-râyara-gaṁḍaḥ,* ‘the disgracer of the three kings (of the South),’ in l. 82 ; and it similarly employs the *biruda Hiṁdurâya-suratrâṇaḥ,* ‘the Sultân among Hindû kings,’ in l. 84, and has several times the Kanarese words *râya* and *mahârâya* for *râjan and mahârâja.* In l.184, we also have *râyasa*, ‘a secretary,’ and in l.194 (only by a mistake of the writer) *varusha* ; and several terms and names which are not Sanskṛit occur in the description of the village in lines 97-99, and in the list of the donees which commences in line 120.

......The inscription is one of the king **Achyutêndra, or Achyutarâya, or Achyutêndra-mahârâya of Vijayanagara.** It clearly divides itself into two parts. The first part, up to l. 91. gives in thirty-eight verses a eulogistic account of Achyutêndra and some of his predecessors, and the second part, from l. 91, records the grand of a village, made by the king in Śaka-Saṁvat 1462.

......Of the thirty-eight verses with which the inscription opens, twenty-two (*viz.* the verses 1, 3-13, and 15-24) occur (as verses 1-6, 9-23, and 29) in the Hampe inscription of Achyutêndra’s immediate predecessor Kṛishṇarâya edited and translated by Dr. Hultzsch in the *Epigraphia Indica,* Vol. I. p. 361 ff. And, omitting mythical beings, the genealogy furnished by these verses, as given by Dr. Hultzsch, *ib.* p. 362, is this :—

Beyond what appears from this tabular statement, the verses referred to contain hardly any historical information whatever.²

......Verse 14³ of the present inscription records that the king **Nṛisiṁha** (Narasa) from a third wife, **Ôbâmbikâ-dêvî,** had one more son, named **Achyutêndra ;** and verse 25 states that this prince, the younger brother of **Kṛishnarâya,** on the death of that king, succeeded him.⁴ The seven verses (26-32) which follow-some of them imitations of preceding verses-eulogize

......¹ See *e.g., Ep. Ind.* Vol. I. p. 363.  
......² See Dr. Hultzsch’s remarks, *ib.* p. 362.  
......³ Verse 2, which is not in the Hampe inscription, invokes the protection of the god Hari (Vishṇu). It is found also in other Vijayanagara inscriptions.  
......⁴ The latest date for Kṛishṇarâya, known to me from published inscriptions, corresponds to Friday, 23rd April, A.D. 1529, and the earliest date for Achyutarâya to Monday, 15th August, A.D. 1530 ; *see Ep. Ind.* Vol. I. p. 399, and *Ind. Ant.* Vol. I. p. 329.
