**TRANSLATION.**

......(Line 1.) Victorious is the boar-inscription of Vishṇu,¹⁴ which agitated the ocean, (*and*) at which the Earth was reposing on the tip of his uplifted right tusk.

......Victorious is Hari¹⁵ who─ when the enemy, in terror of having his body torn, hid in a fissure of the god’s nail─ wondering where he might have gone, vainly cast his glances in all directions, and then broke into a smile when, on shaking his claws, he saw the demon fall before him on the ground, like a particle of dust.

......May he,¹⁶ the wearer of skulls, who has a throat like a row of bees hovering on a white lotus, accomplish your happiness !

......(L. 8.) Hail ! In the reign of victory of the refuge of the universe, the favourite of Fortune and of the Earth, the *Mahârâjâdhirâja Paramêśvara Paramabhaṭṭâraka*, the frontal ornament of the family of **Satyâśraya,** the ornament of the **Châlukyas,** the glorious **Tribhuvanamalladêva,** (*while he,*¹⁷) firmly residing for many days at the glorious city of **Kalyâṇa,** is ruling the earth ; **six years of the glorious Vikrama-time having elapsed, the seventh (year), the year Dundubhi, being current, on Sunday, the first of the bright half of Kârttika of this (year)¹⁸ :—**

......(L. 14.) Of king **Muñja,** dependent on his¹⁹ lotus-feet, the lineage (*is this*) : (*There was*) the governor of the **Pratyaṇḍaka-Fourthousand** country, born in the **Sinda** race, fearless on battle-fields, named **Bhîma.** His first-born, of renowned fame, a favourite of the mighty fortune of victory gained on battle-fields, was **Sindarâja.** Of his son, king **Muñja,** the column of praise (*records*) :—

......Hail ! The *Mahâmaṇḍalêśvara,* the glorious **Muñjarâjadêva,** adorned with the titles ‘he who has attained the five *mahâśabdas,* the *Mahâmaṇḍalêśvara,* the supreme lord of the city
