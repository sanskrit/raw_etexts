......¹ Read ![](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/epigraphica_indica/vol3/images/702.bmp)  
......² The three *aksharas* ![](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/epigraphica_indica/vol3/images/703.bmp) are quite clear in the engraving and cannot be read in any other way. Perhaps something like was intended.  
......³ Read ![](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/epigraphica_indica/vol3/images/704.bmp)  
......⁴ From here the text becomes very incorrect. Originally the donee would have been described thus : ![](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/epigraphica_indica/vol3/images/705.bmp) In the text, as we have it, stands for ![](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/epigraphica_indica/vol3/images/706.bmp), ‘containing three lines of Ṛishis,’ which properly would qualify a *pravara.*  
......⁵ The vowel (*ê*) of this *akshara* seems certain ; but the first *akshara* (*ti*) of the next line is doubtful.  
......⁶ This sign of punctuation is superfluous. The following words would properly be ![](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/epigraphica_indica/vol3/images/707.bmp) they are the words which the donee would use himself at certain sacrificial rites, and they are quite out of place here.  
......⁷ This sign of *visarga* is doubtful.  
......⁸ Read ![](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/epigraphica_indica/vol3/images/708.bmp)  
......⁹ It is difficult to say whether the first *akshara* should be read *a* or *â* ; I believe that it is *a.* *Akarî-kṛitya* takes here the place of the ordinary *śâsanîkṛitya* or *śâsanatvêna.*  
......¹⁰ Read ![](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/epigraphica_indica/vol3/images/709.bmp)  
......¹¹ Metre : Vasantatilakâ.  
......¹² Metre from here up to the end : Ślôka (Anusṭubh).  
......¹³ Read ![](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/epigraphica_indica/vol3/images/710.bmp)  
......¹⁴ Read ![](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/epigraphica_indica/vol3/images/711.bmp)  
......¹⁵ Read ![](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/epigraphica_indica/vol3/images/712.bmp) I should have expected ![](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/epigraphica_indica/vol3/images/713.bmp)
