**No. 31.─ PARLA-KIMEDI PLATES OF THE TIME OF VAJRAHASTA.  
  
BY F. KIELHORN, PH.D., C.I.E. ; GÖTTINGEN.**

......These plates were first brought to Dr. Hultzsch’s notice by Mr. G. V. Ramamurti of **Parlâ-Kimeḍi,** the chief town of the Parlâ-Kimeḍi Zamîndârî in the Gañjâm district of the Madras Presidency, and were afterwards sent to him for examination by the Collector of Gañjâm. They have now been presented to the **Madras Museum** by Sri Padmnabha Deo, brother of the Zamîndâr of Parlâ-Kimeḍi. I edit the inscription which they contain from excellent impressions, supplied to me by Dr. Hultzsch.

......These are **three well preserved copper-plates,** each of which measures 9” long by from 2¾” to 2⅞” broad. About 1 5/16” from the proper right margin, each plate has a round hole, about 11/16” in diameter. The **ring** which passes through these holes had not been cut when the plates were received by Dr. Hultzsch. It is 3½” in diameter and ⅜” thick, and has its ends secured in a slightly oval seal which measures about 1¼” by 1⅜” in diameter. This **seal** bears in relief a bull couchant, facing the proper left, with the moon’s crescent above it, and placed on a plain pedestal which is supported by a lotus flower. Between this flower and the pedestal is the Nâgarî **legend** *śrî-D*\[*â\**\]*raparaṇô.―* Each of the three plates is inscribed on both sides, but the writing which we now find on the first side of the first plate, and, with the exception of four *aksharas,* all the writing on the second side of the third plate, are apparently later additions, and the inscription proper which these plates contain begins therefore on the second side of the first plate and ends at the top of the second side of the third plate. Of the writing within these limits the average **size of the letters** is about ¼”. The **characters,** perhaps the most interesting feature of this inscription, present a curious mixture³ of the Nâgarî alphabet, as written in Southern India, and of several southern alphabets, properly so called. Speaking generally, of about 730 *aksharas* which the inscription contains, 320 are written in Nâgarî and 410 in southern characters ; and the writer has not merely shown his familiarity with several kinds of writing, but has also displayed some skill in the arrangement of the different characters. To show this, it will suffice to draw attention to the manner in which he has written, *e.g.,* the word *parama-mâhêśvarô* in l. 7, and the same word in l. 9 ; *Gaṅgâmalakulatilakô* in l. 8, and *Gaṁgâmala-kulatilakaḥ* in l. 9 ; *sûtradhâra* in l. 3, and the same word in l. 28 ; *guṇa* and *gaṇa* in lines 10 and 11 ; *vahubhir* in l. 25, and *bahubhiś* in lines 25-26 ; *yasya yasya* and *tasya tasya* in l. 26, *etc.* As regards the southern alphabets put under contribution by him, the majority of the characters used is found in the Chêra copper-plates of which a photo-lithograph is published in the *Indian Antiquary,* Vol. V. p. 138 ; but some of the characters employed also are peculiar to what Dr. Burnell has called the Western Châlukya alphabet of A.D. 608, the Eastern (Kalinga) Châlukya alphabets, and even the Chôḷa-Grantha alphabet. It thus happens that, excepting the letters *r* (in *Erayamarâja* in l. 13), *ḷ* (in *Chôḷa* in l. 10), *l* (in *Śêluśêlâgaḍḍî* in l. 18, and *loṁka* in l. 20), and a few others which would not be expected to occur frequently, every letter

......¹ At the commencement of this line, about twelve *aksharas* are almost entirely broken away.  
......² More than half of this line is broken away.  
......³ A similar mixture of different alphabets we find in the Chicacole plates of the Gaṅga *Mahârâja* Satyavarman ; *Ind. Ant.* Vol. XIV. p. 10.
