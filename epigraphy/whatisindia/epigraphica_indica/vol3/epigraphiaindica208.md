****KOLHAPUR INSCRIPTION OF VIJAYADITYA.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*of the Principality of Kolhapoor*, p. 358. I now edit the inscription from an excellent impression, supplied to me by Dr. Fleet.

......The inscription contains 31 lines of writing which covers a space of about 2’ 3” broad by 2’ 1” high, and is in a perfect state of preservation. Above the writing are some sculptures : in the centre, a seated Jaina figures facing full front, on its proper right a cow with a calf, and on the left a crooked sword or dagger ; and above these, on the right the moon, and on the left the sun.― The average **size of the letters** is about ½”.― The **characters** are Old-Kanarese ― The **language,** up to the middle of l. 28, is Sanskṛit ; the remaining lines consist of a verse in Old-Kanarese. The Sanskṛit portion is in prose, excepting that lines 1-3 contain two verses in the Anushṭubh metre. In respect of **orthography,** I need only state that the rules of *saṁdhi* have been frequently disregarded, and that the sign of the *upadhmânîya* (which does not differ from the sign for *r*) has been employed in *arhatah=Purudêvasya,* at the commencement of l. 3. As regards the language of the Sanskṛit part, l. 18 contains the word *haḍapavaḷa* (denoting perhaps a dependent) which is not Sanskṛit, and a few other terms which are not Sanskṛit occur in the list of *birudas* in lines 10-12.

......The inscription records a grant of land by the *Mahâmaṇḍalêśvara* **Vijayâdityadêva** of the **Śiḷâhâra** family.¹ Opening with two verses² which glorify the Jaina faith, it gives in lines 3-15 the following genealogy and description of the donor :― In the **Śiḷâhâra** Kshatriya lineage was a prince **Jatiga,** who had four sons, **Goṅkala, Gûvala, Kîrtirâja,** and **Chandrâditya.** Of these, the prince **Goṅkala** had a son named **Mârasiṁha.** His sons were **Gûvala, Gaṅgadêva, Ballâḷadêva, Bhôjadêva,** and **Gaṇḍarâdityadêva.** And **Gaṇḍarâdityadêva’s** son was the *Mahâmaṇḍalêśvara,* who had attained the five *mahâśabdas,* the illustrious **Vijayâdityadêva,** distinguished by such titles as ‘the supreme lord of the excellent city of **Tagara,** the illustrious **Śiḷâhâra** prince, surpassing by his innate charms the lord of the gods, begotten in the lineage of Jîmûtavâhana, famous for his heroism, having a golden Garuḍa in his ensign, a god of love to maidens, the breaker of the pride of hostile rulers of districts, *maruvaṅka-sarpa,*³ *ayyana-siṅga,* prominent in all excellent qualities, terrific to hostile rulers of districts, to those whom he hates what the lion is to elephants, *iḍuvarâditya,* a Vikramâditya of the Kali age, in beauty of form Nârâyaṇa, by his policy surpassing Chârâyaṇa,⁴ a conqueror of mountain fortresses, a vituperator of his adversaries, *śanivâra-siddhi,*⁵ whose mind is given solely to what is right, who has obtained the favour of a boon from the goddess Mahâlakshmî, and who by nature owns the fragrancy of musk.’

......According to lines 15-26, this **Vijayâdityadêva,** ruling in comfort at his residence of **Vaḷavâḍa,─ on the occasion of a lunar eclipse on Monday, the full-moon tithi of the month Mâgha of the Dundubhi year, when 1065 Śaka years had elapsed,─** granted a field, which by the measure of the **Kûṇḍi⁶** country measured one quarter of a *nivartana,* and a dwelling-house measuring 12 *hastas,* both belonging to the village of **Hâvina-Hêrilage** in the

......² The first of these verses occurs frequently at the commencement of Jaina inscriptions ; the second speaks of the Jaina doctrine as the doctrine of the Arhat Purudêva, a name which I have not met with elsewhere.  
......³ According to Dr. Fleet, either ‘as venomous as a snake in its place of shelter,’ or ‘as venomous as a snake to any one who intrudes on its place of shelter ;’ see *Archæological Survey of Western India, Cave-Temple Inscriptions,* p. 103, note.  
......⁴ I do not know of any Chârâyaṇa who was famous for his politic conduct. The name has been used here simply because it rhymes best with Nârâyaṇa. An inscription in which the same arrangement of the *birudas* has been carried to excess, will be found in Mr. Rice’s *Inscriptions at Śravaṇa-Beḷgoḷa,* pp. 36-37 (No. 53).  
......⁵ This has been translated by ‘he whose desires (or whishes) are accomplished on Saturdays ; see *Ind. Ant.* Vol. II. p. 303 ; *Jour. Bo. As. Soc.* Vol. XIII. p. 6 ; Mr. Rice, *loc. cit.* p. 91. A deity called Śanivârasiddhidêva is mentioned several times in a fragmentary inscription at Kôlhâpur of Śaka-Saṁvat 1161.  
......⁶ See *Ind. Ant.* Vol. XIV. p. 16, l. 4 ; Vol. XVI. p. 20 ; Vol. XIX. p. 244.
