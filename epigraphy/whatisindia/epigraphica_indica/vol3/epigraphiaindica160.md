......**(6) The Mallohaḷḷi grant of the same person,** dated in the thirty-fifth year of his reign, the Vijaya *saṁvatsara,* which is taken by Mr. Rice to be Śaka-Saṁvat 436 current (A.D. 513-14) ; published by Mr. Rice, *Ind.

......**(9) The British Museum grant of Eregaṅga,** which takes the genealogy only as far as Śivamâra-Koṅgaṇi, and contains no date of any kind, but seems intended to belong to a later period than that of Śrîpurusha ; published by myself, *Ind. Ant.* Vol. XIV. p. 229, with a lithograph.

......The **genealogy and dates furnished by these records** are shewn in the Table on the opposite page. And such details as are derivable from them, from a Tamiḷ chronicle called *Koṅgudêśa-râjâkkaḷ,* and from some later documents which have not yet been published, have been compiled by Mr. Rice, with the result of a tolerably lengthy and circumstantial accounts, such as it is ;¹ the misfortune is that there is so very little, in all the early part of it, that is authentic.

......In the inquiry into the nature of these records , the first point to attract attention is,— except in the Nâgamaṅgala grant ; and perhaps in the Hosûr grant, of which neither the text nor a lithograph is available.— **the very marked badness of the orthography.** Even the Nâgamaṅgala grant exhibits, here and there all through, just the characteristics slips that are to be expected somewhere or other in a document which, though prepared with skill and care, is nevertheless not genuine. But, as regards the other records, there are absolutely no genuine epigraphic remains which even approximate to them in this respect. And, for a suitable comparision, we have to go to such documents as the spurious Kurtakôṭi grant, which purports to be the time of the Western Chalukya king Vikramâditya I. and to have been issued in A.D. 610 (*Ind. Ant.* Vol. VII. p. 217), but which is shewn, by even the date recorded in it, to be a palpable forgery, and belongs really to a very much later date. In respect of the British
