****UNAMANJERI PLATES OF ACHYUTARAYA.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Achyutêndra in the ordinary conventional manner. Verses 33-37 give a string of *birudas* of his which are not new to us,¹ and record (as the Hampe inscription does of Kṛishṇarâya) that he was waited upon by the kings of Añga, Vaṅga, and Kaliṅga. And this part of the inscription ends with another verse in praise of Achyutêndra, which is merely an imitation of verse 24 of this same inscription.

......According to verses 39-53 (in lines 91-115) the *Mahârâya* **Achyutêndra,** being on the bank of the river **Tuṅgabhadrâ, on the 12th lunar day of the bright half of Kârttika─ the day when the god Vishṇu rises from his sleep─ of the year 1462 of the era of Śâlivâha, which was the (Jovian) year Śârvarî,** in the presence of the god **Viṭṭhalêśvara,²** and surrounded by many holy men, granted the village of **Uhinai,** which (apparently in consequence of this grant) was also called **Achyutêndraṁahâyapura,** to a number of Brâhmaṇas learned in the Vêdas and famous for their knowledge of the *Śâstras* ; the king having been requested to do so by his trusted minister³ the chief of the *Nâyakas* **Virûpâksha,** who was born in the family of **Ananta** and is described as the moon of te sea of the **\[Â\]diyappêndra** *Nâyakas.*⁴ The village of **Uhinai,** thus granted by Achyutêndra (in terms which are common to the copper-plate grants of the Vijayanagara kings), was situated in the **Śeṅkaḷanîrpaṭṭu** *sîmâ* of the **Kumuḷi** *nâḍu* of the **Raṇḍâyira-mahâvêli** *paṭṭu* of the **Âmûru** *kôṭa* of the **Paḍavîḍu** *mahârâjya* of the **Jayaṅkoṇḍa-Chôḷa** *maṇḍala* ; and lay to the east of the village of **Ayyañchêri,** to the south of the village of **Kuḷappâka,** to the west of the village of **Nallampâka** and **Vêṅkampâka,** and to the north of the village of **Aruṅkâl.**

......**The date,** given in the preceding paragraph, does not admit, of verification ; but the fact that it fell in the Jovian year Śârvarî shows the year to have been Śaka-Saṁvat 1462 expired, and for this year the 12th of the bright half of Kârttika would correspond to the 12th October, A.D. 1540.

......As regards the **localities, Uhinai,** according to Dr. Hultzsch, must be the former name of the very **Ûnamâñjêri** where the plates were found ; for by the *Chingleput Taluk Map* this village lies to the east of **Ayyañjêri,** to the south of **Kolappâkkam,** to the north-west of **Nallampâkkam,** and to the north of **Ariṅgâl,** four of the very places which, under slightly different names, are mentioned in this inscription in the same (or almost exactly the same) positions with reference to Uhinai. **Śeṅkaḷanîrpaṭṭu,** the name of the *sîmâ* of which Uhinai belonged, appears, also according to Dr. Hultzsch, to be an older form of **Śeṅgalpaṭṭu⁵** (Chingleput) ; and **Kumuḷi,** from which the *nâḍu* was called, is the modern **Kumili,⁶** in the Chingleput tâlukâ, south of Ariṅgâl. **Raṇḍâyira-mahâvêli,** *vêli* name of the *paṭṭu,* Dr. Hultzsch informs me, would mean ‘the two thousand great *vêlis,*’ *vêli* being a measure of land. The **Âmûru** *kôṭa* Dr. Hultzsch⁷ considers to have been named after **Âmûr or Âmbûr,** a town in the Vêlûr tâlukâ of the North Arcot district ; and the **Paḍavîḍu** *mahârâjya*, according to the same scholar,⁸ was called after a town now named **Paḍavêḍu** in the Pôlûr tâlukâ of the same district. The **Jayaṅkoṇḍa-Chôḷa** *maṇḍala* is frequently mentioned in Vol. I of Dr. Hultzsch’s *South- Indian Inscriptions.  * \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

......¹ Compare *Ep. Ind.* Vol. I. p. 365, verses 25-28.  
......² This beautifully sculptured temple (No. 4 on the *Madras survey Map of Hampe*) is still in tolerably good preservation. It contains inscriptions of Kṛishṇarâya and Sadâśiva ; see Dr. Hultzsch’s *Progress Report* for December 1888 and January 1889.  
......³ The term in the original (l. 108) is *svâmi-kârya-dhurîṇa,* ‘able to bear the burden of the business of his master.’  
......⁴ On the officials, so named, compare Dr. Hultzsch in *Ind. Ant.* Vol. XIII. p. 127.  
......⁵ Śeṅkaḷanîrpaṭṭu, according to Dr. Hultzsch, is an incorrect spelling of Śeṅgalunîr-paṭṭu, ‘the town of the red lotus, ‘ while Śeṅgal-paṭṭu apparently means ‘the town of bricks.’  
......⁶ Kumili-nâḍu (in Âmûr-kôṭṭam in Jayaṅkoṇḍa-Chôla-maṇḍalam) occurs also in a Tirukkalukkunram inscription of Kulôttuṅga I. ; *Ind. Ant.* Vol. XXI. p. 284.  
......⁷ See *South-Indian Inscription,* Vol. I. p. 126.  
......⁸ *ib.* p. 83, and *ante,* p. 36, note 6.
