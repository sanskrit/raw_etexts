**No. 47.─ RECORDS OF THE SOMAVAMSI KINGS OF KATAK.  
  
BY J. F. FLEET, I.C.S., PH.D., C.I.E.**

......Of the copper-plate charters which I deal with on this occasion, two, C. and F., are now brought to notice for the first time, I believe ; the others are re-edited, partly with a view to giving more correct versions of them, and partly in order to bring the whole series together in one and the same place.

......¹ *Viṭṭôllaka* is probably the same as the Sanakṛit *vishṭi,* the Teluhu *veṭṭi* and the Kanarese *biṭṭi.* The designation of the lowest village servant, *Veṭṭivâḍu* in Tamiḷ, is derived from this word.  
......² With the adjective *Akshasarakaprâpîya* compare *Vaṭasthaḷîkâyîya* in another Valabhî grant ; *Ind. Ant.* Vol. V. p. 206.  
......³ According to Böhtlingk and Roth’s *Sanskṛit-Wörterbuch, pâdâvarta* is explained by the commentator on Kâtyâyana’s *Śrautasûtra* as ‘a square foot.’ Compare also Dr. Fleet’s *Gupta Inscriptions,* p. 170, note 4.  
......⁴ The same expression occurs in another Valabhî grant ; *Ind. Ant.* Vol. IX. p. 238.
