**TRANSLATION.  
  ** Hail ! Hail !

......(Verse 1.) Worship ye incessantly the sun (*which dispels*) the darkness of obstacles, the blessed **Gaṇêśa,** who is praised by the hosts of celestials, pleased by the attainment of the objects of (*their*) desires (*through his favour*) !

......(V. 2.) Victorious is the staff-like tusk of **Vishṇu,** who disported himself in the shape of a boar, (*placed*) on which (*tusk*) the Earth resembled a parasol, with the golden mountain (Mêru) as its top.

......(V. 3.) Hail ! Renowned in the world is the race of the glorious **Kâkatîśas,** the kings born in which are well trained in the protection of the earth.

......(V. 4.) In this (*race*) was (*born*) **Prôla,** the foremost among kings, whose great valour was widely known, who destroyed the crowd of (*his*) enemies in soldierlike fights,¹ (*and*) who was distinguished by the true science of policy. Even now, the hot-rayed sun is moving on the sky as though it were a fragment of the brilliant lustre of his great, far-famed and terrible power.

......(V. 5.) To this favourite of the earth (*Mahîvallabha*) was born a mountain of virtues (*and*) resort of the fortunes of heroes, king **Mâdhava,** whose great and spotless fame was celebrated in the world. Having fallen asleep in a great battle on the two temple of a female elephant, this foremost among warriors awoke on the two breasts of a distinguished nymph of heaven.²

......(V. 6.) His son was king **Gaṇapati,** the ornament of the three worlds (*and*) resting-place of wisdom, who was an adherent of Non-duality (*Advaitavâdin*) with respect to valour;³ who was fierce in (*his*) commands, which (*he*) caused to dance on the crowns of proud crest-jewels among princes ; who had obtained great prosperity through the favour of (Śiva) the lord of Pârvatî ; (*and*) who supported all men with the wealth of the (*whole*) world, (*which he had*) conquered.

......(V. 7.) The foremost among kings (*is*) that ornament of princes, the glorious **Gaṇapa,** to whose fame all the regions are attendants ; the oceans,― tanks for sporting ; (*Mount*) **Mêru,―** a pleasure hill ; (Indra’s *garden*) Nandana,― a splendid park ; yonder disc of the moon,― a looking-glass ; and the interval between heaven and earth,― a palace.

......(V. 8.) To this profound king, who resembled the milk-ocean,⁴ was born **Gaṇapâmbâ,** like another Lakshmî incarnate.

......¹ The author appears to have formed the word *paripara* on the basis of *pariparin,* ‘an enemy.’ which is referred to the by Pâṇini, v. 2. 89.  
......² *i.e.* he was killed in battle.  
......³ *i.e.* he was exclusively devoted to fighting, just as the Vêdântin denies the existence of anything beside the Brahman.  
......⁴ Gaṇapâmbâ’s counterpart, the goddess Lakshmî, is believed to have risen from the milk-ocean.
