****TRANSLATION.****

......(Line 1.) Hail ! Prosperity ! (*The following*) gift (*prasâda*) was graciously made by him who had assumed the title “King of Kings” (*Kôgôn*), His Majesty (*tiruvaḍi*) the king (*kô*), the glorious **Bhâskara Ravivarman,** in the time during which (*he*) was wielding the sceptre and ruling over many hundred-thousands of places, **in the thirty-sixth year after the second year,³** on the day on which (*he*) was pleased to stay at **Muyirikkôḍu :―**

......(L. 6.) “We have given to **Îssuppu Irappân** (*the village of*) **Añjuvaṇṇam,** together with the seventy-two proprietary rights, (*viz*.) the tolls on female elephants and (*other*) riding-animals, the revenue of **Añjuvaṇṇam**, a lamp in day-time, a cloth spread (*in front to walk on*), a palanquin, a parasol, a Vaḍuga (*i.e*. Telugu ?) drum, a large trumpet, a gateway, an arch, a canopy (*in the shape*) of an arch, a garland, and so forth.

......(L. 12.) “We have remitted tolls⁴ and the tax on balances.

......(L. 13) “Moreover, we have granted, with (*these*) copper-leaves, that he need not pay (*the dues*) which the (*other*) inhabitants of the city⁵ pay to the royal palace (*kôyil*), and that (*he*) may enjoy (*the benefits*) which (*they*) enjoy.

......(L. 15.) “To **Ȋssuppu Irappân** of **Añjuvaṇṇam,** to the male children and to the female children born of him, to his nephews, and to the sons-in-law who have married (*his*) daughters, (*we have given*) **Añjuvaṇṇam** (*as*) an hereditary estate⁶ for long as the world and the moon shall exist. Hail !”

......(L. 20.) Thus do I know, **Gôvardhana-Mârtâṇḍan of Vêṇâḍu.** Thus do I know, **Kôdai Śrîkaṇṭhan of Vêṇâpalinâḍu.** Thus do I know, **Mânavêpala-Mânavyan of Êrâḷanâḍu.** Thus do I know, **Ȋrâyiram Śâttan of Vaḷḷuvanâḍu.** Thus do I know, **Kôdai Ravi of Neḍumpuraiyûrnâḍu.** Thus do I know, Mûrkham Śâttan, who holds the office of sub-commander of the forces.

......(L. 27.) The writing of the under-secretary⁷ **Van-Talaiśêri-Gaṇḍan⁸ Kunrapôlan.⁹**

......¹ Read *Îrâyirañ*.  
......² Read *kil*.  
......³ See *ante*, p. 67, note 8.  
......⁴ As remarked by Mr. Ellis (*i.e.* p. 7. f.), the Tamiḻ *ulgu* appears to be a *tadbhava* of the Sanskṛit *śulka*.  
......⁵ This refers evidently to Muyirikkôḍu (l. 4. f.).  
......⁶ These two words are repeated in the original (ll. 18 f. and 19. f.).  
......⁷ The literal meaning of *vây-kkêḷppân,* or, as it is spelled in line 132 of the unpublished Kaśâkûḍi plates of the Pallava king Nandivarman, *vâyi-kkêṭppân*, is ‘one who hears (the words of) the mouth (of the king),’ *i.e.* ‘a secretary.’  
......⁸ *i.e.* “the hero of great Tellicherry.”  
......⁹ *i.e.* “the mountain-splitter,” an epithet of the god Skanda.
