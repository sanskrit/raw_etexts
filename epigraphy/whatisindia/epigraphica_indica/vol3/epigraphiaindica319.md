****GANESGAD PLATES OF DHRUVASENA I.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

the lower end of a well-preserved oval **seal,** which measures about 2¼ by 1⅞ inch. The back of the seal is of convex shape. On the front of the seal, a oval border, measuring 1¾ by 1⅜ inch, is divided by a pair of horizontal lines into two compartments, of which the upper one contains, in bas-relief, a recumbent bull which faces the proper right, and the lower one, in raised letters, the usual legend \[Sanskrit\]:. The weight of the two plates is 3 lbs. 7½ oz. and that of the two rings and the seal 7½ oz. ; total, 3 lbs. 15 oz.

......The date at the end of the inscription furnishes of the **numerical symbols** for 5, 7, 10 and 200, and the symbol for 300 occurs in line 14. The language is tolerably correct **Sanskṛit.** The proper name *Bhaṭakka* (for *Bhaṭârka*) in line 3 and on the seal,¹ and the relapsed from Sanskṛit into his **Prâkṛit** vernacular.

......The plates record an order, issued from (his capital) **Valabhî** (line 1) by **Dhruvasêna \[I.\]** (l. 10) and conferring on a Brâhmaṇa eight measures (*khaṇḍa*) of land two cisterns in the village of **Hariyânaka,** which belonged to **Akshasarakaprâpa,** a subdivision of **Hastavaprâharaṇî** (l. 12). I am unable to identify the village of Hariyânaka and the subdivision in which it was included. The district of Hastavaprâharaṇî, Hastakavaprâharaṇî, or Hastavaprâhâra is mentioned in three other Valabhî grants.² Hastavapra or Hastakavapra, to which it owes its name, has been identified with **Hâthab,** six miles south of Gôghâ in the Bhâvnagar State, and with the ‘Astakapra’ of Ptolemy and of the *Periplûs*.³

......The *Dûtakaof* the grant was the door-keeper **Mammaka,** and the writer of the edict was **Kikkaka** (l. 28). the latter also wrote the three other published grants of Dhruvasêna I.4 and the former acted as *Dûtaka* of one of these three grants.5 The date of the subjoined grant was the 15th *tithi* of the dark fortnight of Vaiśâkha of **the (Gupta) year 207** (l. 29 f.), *i.e.* A.D. 526-27. Another grant of Dhruvasêna I., published by Professor Bühler,6 is dated in the same year, which forms the earliest date of the Valabhî dynasty that has been hitherto found in inscriptions.

......From my translation of the genealogical portion of this inscription it will be seen that I have added a fresh rendering of the passage which mentions the **Maitrakas,** to the earlier translations of it.7 In line 1, the original clearly and unmistakably reads *maitrakâṇâm=atulabala-sapatnaº.* This is also the reading of the published facsimiles of the remaining early Valabhî grants,8 the editors of which have read *sapanna* because they had in their minds the reading *saṁpanna,* which actually occurs in the later Valabhî grants. As all the earlier grants raed *sapatna,* we must, in the absence of cogent reasons to the contrary, assume that this was also the reading of the original draft of the Valabhî *vaṁśâvali,* and that *saṁpanna,* the reading of the later grants, is a mere clerical error. I am obliged to dwell on this detail because the reading *sapatna* finally disposes of the possibility of constructing the word *Maitrakâṇâm* with the next following compound, and forces us to connect the word with the verb *abhavat,* which is omitted, but must be supplied to complete the sentence. Whether we
