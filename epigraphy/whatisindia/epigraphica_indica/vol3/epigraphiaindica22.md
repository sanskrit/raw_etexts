****BITRAGUNTA GRANT OF SAMGAMA II.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

comparatively old in their formation. The vowels *i* and *î*, *o* and *ô*, though distinguished in some cases by a partial and complete loop on the top respectively, are however often confounded. To avoid constant corrections arising from close transcription, I have, in the case of *i* and *î*, always adopted that form which the context proves to be correct. The vowels *ê, ai* and *au* are the undeveloped forms of their modern modifications in Telugu. The *ê* of *prâyêṇa* in line 53, and the length of ô of *bhâgô* in line 146, are shown as in the modern Telugu character.

......As regards **orthography,─** *dhdha* for *ddha* frequently occurs (ll. 20, 101, 108, 157 and 163). The redundant use of an *anusvâra* before a conjunct nasal is quite common (ll. 10, 12, 48, 113, 131, *etc*.). As in other inscriptions, a consonant which follows *r,* is sometimes doubled. In lines 15, 20, and 21 the *pa* of *Kaṁppa*, and in line 31 the *ya* of *saṁyyuga* are doubled after an *anusvâra*. A curious mistake is committed in line 60, where *kadâchiptriyaṁ* is written for *kadâchit=priyaṁ.* There are a number of other graphical peculiarities which are due to the influence of the **Telugu** pronunciation of Sanskṛit. Except in *nirvṛitiṁ* in line 59, *ṛi* is generally represented by *ru*. In lines 66 and 122, both *ṛi* and *u, ḷi* and *u* are respectively affixed to the same consonant, and once (l. 181) *ṛi* is represented by *ṛi*. It is worth noticing that the word *nâtha*, which occurs four times in the inscription (ll. 50, 52, 161 and 189), is spelt in the first three cases with an *anusvâra* in such cases (compare *tammuḍu* and *tammuṁdu*). The spelling *braṁhmassoṁ* (ll. 178 and 179 f.) for *brahmasvaṁ, saijñi* (l. 87) for *saṁjñi, saijña* (l. 186) for *saṁjña*, the prefixing of a *y* before *i* and *ê* and *vice versa* (ll. 21, 22, 23, 44, 65, 160, 168 and 180) are also due to the Telugu pronunciation of Sanskṛit.

......The inscription opens with an invocation to the Boar-incarnation of Vishṇu (verse 1). **Saṁgama I.,** the first historical ancestor of the **first Vijayanagara dynasty,** is then introduced without any reference to his mythical descent from the Moon, as is done in other Vijayanagara grants (verse 2). He had five sons,─ **Harihara, Kampa, Bukka, Mârapa and Muddapa** (verses 3 and 4). Of these, the first two ruled one after the other. **Harihara** is said to have defeated the Muḥammadans (verse 5). **Kampa** (verse 4) or **Kampaṇa** (verse 6) had a son, called **Saṁgama II.** (verse 7), during whose time the subjoined inscription was written. Of this king we learn nothing but a number of *bîrudas* (verse 11). The inscription records the grant of the village of **Biṭraguṇṭa** (verses 20, 21) or **Biṭṭarakuṇṭa** (verse 19) to twenty-eight Brâhmaṇas, whose names and *gôtras* are specified in verses 27 to 33 ; and refers incidentally to the grant of another village, *viz*. **Siṁkêsari** (verse 24). Both grants were made at the suggestion of the king’s spiritual preceptor, the **Śaiva** philosopher **Śrîkaṇṭhanâtha** (verse 12 and line 189), after whose name the village of Biṭraguṇṭa received the surname **Śrîkaṇṭhapura** (verses 21, 34, 35 and 42). The date of the first grant was the new-moon day of the third month of **Śaka-Saṁvat 1278** (in numerical words and figures), the cyclic year Durmukha. The inscription was written by **Bhôganâtha**, the court-jester of Saṁgama II. (verse 35). At the end of the document (l. 184), the king is stated to have affixed by his own hand the name of **Śrî-Virûpâksha,** the tutelary deity of the city of Vijayanagara (verse 42). This explains the origin of the colophons *Śrî-Virûpâksha, Śrî-Veṅkaṭêśa* or *Śrî-Râma* at the end of other Vijayanagara inscriptions.

......The motive for making the grant under consideration is stated to have been twofold, — first, a request, or almost a compulsory demand, of the preceptor Śrîkaṇṭhanâtha, and, secondly, the king’s own desire to produce immortality to his father (verses 17 and 20). The second statement further suggests that the expression *pratyabdakâlê* in verse 20 means “at the anniversary (of his father’s death).” The inscription does not inform us if the first or any following anniversary is meant. But the motive why the king made the grant, *i.e.* for procuring immortality to his father, gives us sufficient room for conjecture. It is a well-known Hindû notion that the spirit of a dead man will continue to be a *Prêta*, or an evil spirit, until the
