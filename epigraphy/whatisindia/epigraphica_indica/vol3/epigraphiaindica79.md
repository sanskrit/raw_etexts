****UDAYENDIRAM PLATES OF VIKRAMADITYA II.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

......(V. 11.) His son was **Prabhumêrudêva,** who drove away all enemies, whose mind was intent on the four branches of knowledge,¹ who was refined, a source of the fame of irresistible valour, full of energy, and free from fault and sorrow.

......(V.12.) From him sprang a son of matches fortune, named **Vikramâditya,** before whom the hosts of adversaries bowed down, (*and*) whose great renown was widely spread ; a man of refinement, who was the chief of the families of princes, (*and*) whose mind was fixed on the two lotus-feet of the lord of Pârvatî.

......(V. 13.) He, again, had a son named **Vijayâditya,** frightened by whose valour the enemies ran away in battle.

......(V. 14.) He also bore another name, **Pungalvippavar-Gaṇḍa,** widely known and un-bearable to opponents. Cleft by his sword in battle, the elephants shed their blood as clouds do the rain-water.

......(V. 15.) To him was born a son **Vijayabâhu,** named **Vikramâditya,** a unique light of the **Bâṇa** family, who has followed the path of prudent conduct, before whom the assemblage of opponents has bowed down, (*and*) who has **Kṛishṇarâja** for his friend. Eminently prosperous (*he is, and*) free from evil and distress.

......(Line 45.) This (*prince*), the dust of whose feet is tinged with the lustre of the jewels on the edges of the diadems of all princes without exception, and whose two arms are filled with ample fame, gained in victories over the multitude of arms of the adherents of many different hostile princes,― after pouring out a stream of water from the beautiful golden jar, held by the palms of his hands the bracelets on which are thickly covered with² various bright jewels,― (*has given*) to the excellent twice-born, dwelling at **Udayêndumaṅgala,** who delight in, what is their proper duty, the knowledge of the truth of all the Vêdas and Vêdâṅgas and philosophy, (*and*) are eager to impart the knowledge of things which is stored up in their minds, . . .

***.****B.― The odd Plate.***

......(Lines 13-18.)³ This (*prince*), whose broad chest is rested on by the Fortune of Victory whom he has gained by his victories in many battles, a sun to illuminate the very bright heaven of the **Bâṇa** family, whose lotus-feet are tinged with the rays of the ruby gems, fastened on to the sides of the diadems of numerous hostile princes bowing down before him,― after pouring out a stream of water from the beautiful large golden water-pot, held by the palms of him hands,― . . to the Brâhmaṇas, . . of the Vêdas . . . . .

**No. 14.― UDAYENDIRAM PLATES OF VIRA-CHOLA.  
  
BY F. KIELHORN, PH.D., C.I.E. ; GÖTTINGEN.**

......This inscription, or rather, fragment of an inscription, has been previously published, with a photo-lithograph, by the Rev. T. Foulkes, in the *Indian Antiquary,* Vol. IX. pp. 47 ff. and in the *Manual of the Salem District,* Vol. II. pp. 365 ff. I re-edit it from an excellent impression received from Dr. Hultzsch, to whom the original plates, which are at **Udayêndiram,** in the Guḍiyâtam Tâlukâ of the North Arcot district, were lent by the Acting Collector of the district, Mr. F. A. Nicholson, I.C.S.

......¹ See Sir M. Monier-Williams’s *Dictionary*, s. v. *vidyâ* :― *trayê*, the triple Vêda;’ *ânvikshikê*, ‘logic and metaphysics ;’ *daṇḍa-nîti,* ‘the science of government ;’ and *vârttâ*, ‘practical arts, such as agriculture, commerce, medicine, *etc*.’  
......² Literally, *vilîna* would rather be ‘hidden by.’  
......³ Lines 1-12 of the odd plate are identical with lines 33-44 of the preceding inscription.
