**No. 5.─ SATYAMANGALAM PLATES OF DEVARAYA II.  
  
SAKA-SAMVAT 1346.  
  
BY E. HUZTZSCH, PH.D.**

......This inscription is engraved on three copper-plates of 5¾ by 9½ by inches, which were “found hidden in a *paṭṭâ* land, belonging to one Aruṇâchala Aiyar, in the village of **Satyamaṅgalam** in the Vêlûr (Vellore) tâlukâ,” and kindly transmitted to me for examination by the Collector of the North Arcot district, Mr. H. Le Fanu, I.C.S. The ring on which the plates must have been originally strung, is missing. The inscription is in the **Nandinâgarî** alphabet and in Sanskṛit verse ; a few short passages in prose occur in lines 42 f., 51 f., and at the end of the last plate.

......The inscription records that king **Dêvarâya II.** of **Vijayanagara** bestowed on eight Brâhmaṇas the *agrahâra* of **Chiṭeyâṭyûru,** which he had surnamed **(Dêvarâyapura)** after himself (verse 25). This village was situated in **Ânda-nâḍu,³** a sub-division of **Maratakanagara-prânta.** The grant was made at the temple of **Virûpâksha⁴** on the bank of the **Tuṅgabhadrâ** river (v. 23). The date of the grant was Monday, the new-moon *tithi* of Âshâḍha in **Śaka-Saṁvat 1348,** the Krôdhi *saṁvatsara* (v. 24). Mr. Dikshit has favoured me with the following information regarding this date :—

......“Amânta Âshâḍha *kṛishṇa amâvâsyâ* of Śaka-Saṁvat 1346 expired, the Krôdhi *saṁvatsara*, ended on Tuesday, the 25th July, A.D. 1424, commencing on Monday, the 24th July, as late as 56 *gh*. 13 *p*. Ujjain mean-time. This is not the *tithi* in question, as the original has a Monday. Besides, Âshâḍha was intercalary in this year, and its *amâvâsyâ* ended on **Monday, the 26th June, A.D. 1424,** at 31 *gh*. 56 *p*. Ujjain mean-time. This seems to be the *tithi* in question, though the word *adhika*, “intercalary,” is not added in the original. There was a solar eclipse on this date (26th June), though I have not ascertained whether it was visible in India or not.”

......The historically important part of the inscription is the genealogy of the **first dynasty of Vijayanagara,** which is given in verses 3 to 21. As in other inscriptions,⁵ **Yadu** of the **race of the Moon** is mentioned as the mythical ancestor of this dynasty. The first historical person is **Saṁgama \[I.\]** (v. 5). One of his sons was **Bukka \[I.\]** (v. 6), whose descendants are named in the same order as in a previously published inscription of Dêvarâya II.⁶ Besides, the new inscription mentions the names of the queens of **Bukka I.** and of his three direct descendants, and

......¹ The word *manu* appears to be used here in its Tantric sense, *viz*. in that of *mantra*.  
......² The word “fortune” is repeated five times in the original.  
......³ Other forms of this name are Ândi-nâḍu and Âñja-nâḍu. To Ândi-nâḍu belonged the village of Vêppambaṭṭu (in the Vêlûr tâlukâ) ; *South-Indian Inscriptions,* Vol. I. pp. 80 and 131. A sub-division of Âñja-nâḍu was the *sîmâ* of Guḍiyâtam (now the head-quarters of a tâlukâ) ; *Ind. Ant.* Vol. XIII. p. 132, verse 54.  
......⁴ This is the Pampâpati temple at Hampe ; *Ep. Ind.* Vol. I. p. 363.
