**TRANSLATION.**

......(Line 1.) Ã”m. Hail !

......Dwelling at his glorious royal residence of victory,⁸ the *Paramabhaṭṭâraka Mahârâjâdhiraja Paramêśvara,* the glorious **Vijayarâjadêva** being in good health, grants to the illustious Vigahapâla, son of Dusala, and to Mihirâva, son of Kusuarâ, of the **Palha** clan, a document of favour, to this effect that—

......I, the glorious *Bhaṭṭâraka,* have graciously granted (*to you*) in perpetuity, in the **Kêsarikôṭṭa** district (*paribhôga*), cultivated land and wells and houses and house-slaves and whatever has not any day been enjoyed by Mûladêva,⁹ to be possessed by you, your sons, grandsons, great-grandsons and so forth, as long as the moon, the sun and the stars endure ; (*and*) not to be interfered with by any commander of forces.¹⁰ The (*rulers*) of (*my*) family or other (*rulers*) have no claim (*to this*). It may be enjoyed by (*your*) own hands and (*with your consent*) by the hands of others. This is the settlement (*made*) here in perpetuity. The *Mahârâjñî,* the glorious **Lachchhidêvî,** and the *Mahârâjñî*, the glorious **Haṁsinîdêvi.**

......(L. 6) I, the glorious *Bhaṭṭâraka,* have also graciously given the whole village of **Pôtâ**, with its bipeds, quadrupeds, fields (*and*) house-slaves, to the sons and grandsons of the illustrious Vigahapâla, as a *bhaṭṭa*-village. No other **Palha** has any claim (*to it*). Excepting the village of **Pôtâ**, the sons of **Kusuarâ** are to enjoy everything as written (*above*). (*My*) well and virtuously behaved (*subjects*), ready to obey my commands, will carry out everything written above.

**No. 45.— NAGPUR MUSEUM INSCRIPTION OF SOMESVARA ;  
  
SAKA-SAMVAT 1130.  
  
BY H. KRISHNA SASTRI ; BANGALORE.**

......The slab which bears the subjoined inscription, is preserved in the Museum at **NÃ¢gpur.** I edit this record from three sets of excellent inked estampages, one of which was supplied to  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

......¹ Read *varjayitvâ śêshaṁ.*  
......² Read *ºrâṇâm*- ; instead of the Genitive one would have expected the Instrumental case here and in the next word.  
......³ Read –*vidhêyânâm*=, for –*vidhêyair*=.  
......⁴ For *nirvakshyatê*.  
......⁵ Read -*âdêśâch=chhrî-.*  
......⁶ Intended for *ºdêvêna Maṁguka-sutêna.*  
......⁷ This is engraved in large letters on the proper right margin.  
......⁸ Or, it may be, ‘dwelling at the glorious (town) of victory Kaṭaka’ ; see page 313 above, note 3.  
......⁹ I am somewhat doubtful about this, but see no way of translating the original text differently. It is strange that the name of the village, to which the land belonged, should have been omitted.  
......¹⁰ The original has *balâdhikṛita.*
