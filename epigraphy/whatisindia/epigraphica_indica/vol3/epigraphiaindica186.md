****SRAVANA-BELGOLA EPITAPH OF MALLISHENA.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

......7. **Samantabhadra¹** (v. 6). The composer quotes two verses (7 and 8) which this preceptor is represented to have addressed to an unnamed king, probably of **Karahâṭaka** (Karhâḍ),² and in the first of which he professes to have undertaken a missionary tour to **Pâṭaliputra** (Paṭna), **Mâlava, Sindhu, Ṭhakka** (the Panjâb), **Kâñchîpura,** and **Vaidiśa (Bêsnagar).**

......8. Verse 9 speaks of a person who “broke by his sword the solid stone pillar, which barred the road to the acquisition of the fortune of the kingdom,” and states that this unnamed person was assisted by the sage **Siṁhanandin.** As noticed by Mr. Rice.³ a similar feat is attributed in the Udayêndiram plates of the Gaṅga-Bâṇa king Râjasiṁha, *alias* Hastimalla, to the first Gaṅga king, Koṅgaṇi, “who in his youth, resembling the powerful Śiśu (Kârttikêya) in gracefulness, cut in two a huge stone pillar with the sword in his hand at a single stroke.”⁴ The same plates appear to connect Siṁhanandin with the mythical founder of the Gaṅga dynasty in stating that “the Gaṅga race obtained prosperity through the power of Siṁhanandin.”⁵ I cannot follow Mr. Rice in considering this coincidence between the Mallishêṇa epitaph and the Hastimalla plates “a most important identification,” but would only conclude from it that the same legendary traditions were known to the composers of both documents.

......9. **VakragrÃ®va⁶** (v. 10).

......10. **Vajranandin,⁷** author of the *NavastÃ´tra* (v. 11).

......11. **PÃ¢trakÃªsarin⁸** (v. 12).

......12. **SumatidÃªva,** author of the *Sumatisaptaka* (v. 13).

......13. **KumÃ¢rasÃªna \[I.\],** was born and died in the South (v. 14).

......14. **Chintâmaṇi,** author of the *Chintâmaṇi* (v. 15).

......15. **Śrîvarddhadêva,9** author of the poem *Chûḷâmaṇi* (v. 16). A verse (17) in his praise by **Daṇḍin** is quoted.

......16. **Mahêśvara** (v. 18 f.).

......17. **Akalaṅka,** defeated the **Bauddhas** in disputation (v. 20). Three verses (21 to 23) by him are quoted, which he is represented to have addressed to a king **Sâhasatuṅga,** and in the third of which he claims to have overcome the Bauddhas in the court of king **Himaśîtala.** A legendary account of this dispute between Akalaṅka and the Bauddhas in the court of “Hêmasithalan” at Kâñchîpura forms part of the Mackenzie Manuscripts, and an abstract of it was published by the Rev. W. Taylor.¹⁰ Another document of equally questionable
