**No. 12.— THREE INSCRIPTIONS OF CHOLA CHIEFS.  
  
BY T. P. KRISHNASVAMI, B.A.  
  
A.— BILVANATHESVARA INSCRIPTION OF VIRA-CHAMPA.  
  
Saka-Samvat 1236.**

......This inscription¹ is engraved on the south wall of a *maṇḍapa* in front of the **Bilvanâthêśvara** shrine at **Tiruvallam** in the North Arcot district. It consists of three Sanskṛit verses in the **Grantha** alphabet and records the erection, by an ascetic named Jñânâtman (verse 1) or Jñânamûrti (verses 2 and 3), of the *maṇḍapa* on which it is engraved. The funds for the building were provided by a chief, called **Vîra-Champa,** who was the son of a **Chôḷa** king (verse 1) ; and the erection took place in **Śaka-Saṁvat 1236** (verse 2). The building received the name “Bhadra-maṇḍapa,” *i.e.* the auspicious *maṇḍapa* (verses 1, 2 and 3), and the second name **Nidrâvasânavijayi-maṇḍapa** (verse 3), which was derived from a *biruda* of **Vîra-Champa** (verse 1). Jñânamûrti also built a shrine of Śiva, called **Nâyaka-Śivâlaya,** on the side of the *maṇḍapa* (verse 3). The name of this shrine may also refer to Vîra-Champa, and suggests that he was a Nâyaka or lieutenant of a **unnamed** king. Tiruvallam is referred to under the form **Valla** (verse 3), and its Śiva temple is **called** “the lord of **Śrî-Valla**” (verses 1 and 2).

**TRANSLATION.**

......(Verse 1.)⁴ The glorious king **Vîra-Champa,** who used to win **victories** at the time of the competition of sleep,⁵ (*and*) who was the son of the glorious **Chôḷa** king,― having speedily conquered all the hostile kings in battle,― caused to be built with their treasures, by an ascetic, called **Jñânâtman**, a *maṇḍapa*, named Bhadra (*i.e.* auspicious), which affords delight to Śiva, the lord of **Śrî-Valla.**

......⁵ This curious epithet appears to mean that Vîra-Champa was so certain of his victory that he used to enjoy sound sleep before his battles.
