......(L. 42.)─ Ôm ! His son (*was*) the glorious **Nîtimârga-Koṅguṇivarman,** the pious *Mahârâjâdhirâja,* the *Paramêśvara,* who had the first name of “the glorious **Eregaṅgadêva,”** (*and was also called*) **Komara-veḍeṅga ;¹** whose forehead was adorned with the binding on of the fillet (*oj sovereignty*) of (or by) **Ereyappa ;** (*and*) who effected a public defeat of the **Pallavas** in battle at **Jantepperupeñjeru²** and other places.

......(L. 45.)— Ôm ! His son (*was*) **Satyavâkya-Koṅguṇivarman,** the pious *Mahârâjâdhirâja,* the *Paramêśvara,* who had the first name of “the glorious **Narasiṅghadêva,**” (*and was also called*) **Vîra-veḍeṅga.³**

......(L. 48.)— Ôm ! (Metre) :─ His younger brother, possessed of prosperity and wealth acquired by his own arm, went to the glorious **Baddega,** the favorite of the earth, in the country of **Ḍahâḷa,** and then, being of the most excellent understanding, wedded his daughter, along, of a verity, with the maiden Eloquence, at **Tripurî.** Or again :— There was born the king who had the appellation of “the glorious **Bûtuga ;**” who conquered the host of (*his*) enemies ; who was excessively fierce ; (*and*) who,— being, through (*his*) might, one who ranked first in enumerations of kings,— when that king named **Baddega** had gone to appropriate the fortunes of (the god) Indra in heaven,⁵ took elephants and horses and white umbrellas and thrones from the possession of **Lallêya (?),** and gave (*them*) to king **Kṛishṇa.** Moreover,⁶ from this excessively fierce king **Gaṅga-Gâṅgêya,** did not **Kakkarâja,** lord of **Aḷachapura,** acquire (*fear*) of death ? ; did not **Dantivarman,** named **Bijja,** hurriedly go (*in flight*) in war to his own **Banavâsî ? ;** did not **Râjavarman,** become quieted ? ; did not Dâmari, lord of **Nuḷuvugiri,** whose country was made quite, obtain the breaking of (*his*) pride ? ; (*and*) did not **Nâgavarman** feel, mid-way, the (?) very extremity of fear ? Having, at command indeed, conquered king **Râjâditya,** who was made arrogant by pride in (*his*) array of elephants,— having . . . . . . . . . . . . .⁷ laid siege to the town of **Tañjâpurî,─** (*and*) having burnt numbers of hill-forts, headed by **Nâḷkôṭe,─** (*he*), the glorious **Gaṅga-Nârâyaṇa,** of his own accord gave to (king) **Kṛishṇa lordly elephants** (*and*) horses (*and*) great wealth. (Âryâ) :— With thunderbolts that were the maxims of those who interpret the Vêdic writings, *ect.,* (*he*), king **Jayad-uttaraṅga,⁸** cleft open the frontal globes of the lordly elephants who are the expounders of evil precepts, puffed up with the rut that is the doctrine of devotion to one sole object of worship.

......(L. 64.)— (Alliterative prose) :— **Satyanîtivâkya-Koṅguṇivarman,** the pious *Mahârâjâdhirâja,* the *Paramêśvara,* who has the first name of “the glorious **Bûtuga,**” (*and who is also called*) **Nanniya-Gaṅga,⁹─** while ruling over **the Gaṅga maṇḍala,** (*which*) assuredly (*consists of*) **ninety-six thousand (villages) ;** (*and*) when staying at the town of **Purikara,─ when eight hundred of the Śaka years, increased by sixty, have gone by ; on Sunday, the eight tithi, (called) Nandîśvara,¹⁰ in the bright fortnight of the month Kârttika of the  ** \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

......¹ *i.e.* “a wonder among princes.” *Komara* is a corruption of *kumâra.*  
......² Or, perhaps, “Bantepperupeñjeru.” Or, again, two places,— the second of them being Peñjeru,— may be named.  
......³ *i.e.* “a wonder among brave men,”  
......⁴ *i.e.* “the quarrelsome or fighting Gaṅga.”  
......⁵ *i.e.* “had died.”  
......⁶ See page 180 above, note 2.  
......⁷ The meaning of *gaṇḍugamahâ* or *gaṇṭugamahâ* (line 60) is not apparent.  
......⁸ *i.e.* “the arch of victory,” *Jayada* is the Kanarese genitive.  
......⁹ *i.e.* “the affectionate, kind, or truthful Gaṅga.” *Nanniya,* again, is a Kanarese genitive.  
......¹⁰ This seems to be the intended meaning of the text ; but the word *nandîśvara* does not occupy a position corresponding to my translation.— A Nandîśvara *tithi* in the month Phâlguna appears to be mentioned in the Peggûr inscription (*Ind. Ant.* Vol. VI. p. 102, text line 4-5, and Vol. XIV. p. 76 ; and *Coorg Inscriptions,* p. 7).
