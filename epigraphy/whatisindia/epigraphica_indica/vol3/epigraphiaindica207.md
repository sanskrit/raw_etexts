*kÃ¢yÃ´tsarga*), abandoned (*his*) unstable body,¹ in order to produce, as it were, the complete destruction of (Cupid) who springs from the body.

......(Line 209.) NOTE.― When this noble disciple of² the holy **Ajitasêna,** the king of *Paṇḍitas,* was about to abandon his body by the rite of *sallêkhanâ,* which is celebrated in the **Âgamas** of the **Jainas,** he quickly composed the following faultless verse (*padya*), in order to illustrate the ripeness of his own mind, (*and*) in order to give delight to the whole Congregation (*Saṁgha*) that had assembled with the desire of witnessing the rite of *samâdhi,* and of performing (*the services*) usual (*on such occasions*) :―

......(V. 71.) “Having obtained the triad of jewels,³ proclaimed in the **Âgamas,** having reached freedom from pain,⁴ and having practised forbearance with all beings, we abandon the body at the feet of **Jina** and go to heaven.â€?

......(V. 72.) In the **Śâka** (*year*) measured by the sky (0), the arrows (5), the sky (0), and the earth (1), *(i.e.* **1050**), in the (*cyclic*) year **Kîlaka,** in the month of Phâlgunaka, on the third day, in the dark (*fortnight*), on a Sunday,⁵ under (*the nakshatra*) Svâti, at noon, at **Śvêtasarôvara,─** the holy sage **Mallishêṇa,** the lord of ascetics, went to the city of the gods in consequence of three day’s fasting.

......(Line 222.) (*The above*) was written by **Mallinâtha,** (*who was*) a lay-disciple⁶ of the holy **Maladhâridêva,** (*and who surpassed all*) writers of eulogies,⁷ just as **Mahêśvara** (*burnt*) Cupid. (*It*) was engraved by **Gaṅgâchâri,** the head-ornament of engravers⁸ of eulogies.

......¹ \[The words (*aṅgam*) *bhâvayan bhâvanâbhiḥ* correspond to the stereotyped expression *appâṇaṁ bhâvaṇâhiṁ bhâvêmâṇê* (*âtmânaṁ bhâvanâbhir bhâvayan*), and the words *vyasṛijad aṅgam* are a paraphrase of *kâyôtsargam akarôt,* ‘he practised the *kâyôtsarga,*’ in the observance of which five methods (*bhâvanâ*) are distinguished. The following two verses contain the names of the five *bhâvanâs* or *tulanâs,* and the places in which the five subdivisions of the second *bhâvanâ* are practised :―  
...................tavêṇa 1 sattêṇa 2 suttêṇa 3 êgattêṇa 4 balêṇa ya 5 \|  
...................tulaṇâ pañchahâ vuttâ Jiṇakappaṁ paḍivajjaô \|\|  
...................paḍhamâ uvassayammî, bîyậ bâhi, taїyâ chaükkammi \|  
...................sunnaharammi chaütthî, aha pañchamiyâ masâṇammi \|\|  
“The *tulanâ* (or *bhâvanâ*) of one who follows the Jina-kalpa, is declared (*to be*) fivefold, viz. I. *tapasî,*  
2. *sattvêna,* 3. *sûtrêṇa,* 4. *êkatvêna,* and 5. *balêna.*  
“The first (*sattva-bhâvanâ*) (*is practised*) in a convent or other residence (*upâśraya*), the second, outside (*bahiḥ*), the third, on a *chauk* (*chatushka*), the fourth, in a solitary house (*śûnya-ghara*), and the fifth, on a ceme- tery (*śmaśâna*).”― E. L.\]  
......² Literally, ‘he whose mind had become a bee at the divine lotus-feet of.’  
......³ The three *ratnas* are *jñâna, darśana,* and *châritra* or *dharma* ; see Dr. Bhandarkar’s *Report on Skt. MSS* 1883-84, p. 100.  
......⁴ ![](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/epigraphica_indica/vol3/images/150.bmp) appears to be incorrectly used in the sense of ![](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/epigraphica_indica/vol3/images/151.bmp).  
......⁵ The words ![](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/epigraphica_indica/vol3/images/152.bmp) appear to stand for ![](https://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/epigraphica_indica/vol3/images/153.bmp).  
......⁶ On *guḍḍa,* ‘a disciple,’ see *Ind. Ant.* Vol. XVIII. p. 36, note 4, and Mr. Rice’s *Inscriptions at Śravaṇa Beḷgoḷa,* p. 35 and 40 of the Introduction.  
......⁷ The word *biruda* appears to be used in the sense of *praśasti.*  
......⁸ *Rûṿâri* is probably a *tadbhava* of *rûpakârin* ; compare *pûjâri* for *pûjâkârin.*
