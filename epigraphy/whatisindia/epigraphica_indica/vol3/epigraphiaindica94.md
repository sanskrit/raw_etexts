****YENAMADALA INSCRIPTION OF GANAPAMBA.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**No. 16.─ YENAMADALA INSCRIPTION OF GANAPAMBA.  
  
BY. E. HULTZSCH, PH.D.**

......An abridged English translation of this inscription, based on a copy from the collection of Colonel Colin Mackenzie,¹ was published by Mr. Gordon Mackenzie in the *Manual of the Kistna District,* p. 13 f. The original is engraved on four faces of a pillar is now lying in the **Yenamadala** in the Guṇṭûr tâlukâ of the Kistna district.² The pillar is now lying in the temple of Vêṇugôpâla. Before its removal to this place of comparative safety, the villagers were using it for grinding chunnam on it. This objectionable practice has led to the destruction of a considerable portion of the inscription. The first and second faces, which bear an inscription in the Telugu alphabet and the Sanskṛit language, are somewhat worn, but still legible. Of the third face, however, which, as the published version of Colonel Mackenzie’s copy shows, formerly contained the first half of a long passage in the Telugu alphabet and language, only the first seven lines are now visible, while the remaining lines are worn smooth, with the exception of one, two, or three letters at the Telugu portion, and three other Telugu inscriptions of slightly later date, a again in tolerably good preservation. The last of the Telugu inscriptions on the fourth face is continued at the bottom of the first face, which had been left blank by the engraver of the first inscription. Finally, a short Telugu inscription, which looks quite recent, but has been mistaken for a portion of the first inscription,³ is engraved at the bottom of the second face.

......Besides the two later additions on their lowermost portions, the **first and second faces of the pillar** bear, as stated above, an inscription in the **Telugu** alphabet and the **Sanskṛit** language. It consists of twenty-five verses, the first two of which are addressed to Gaṇêśa and the Boar-incarnation of Vishṇu. Verse 3 refers to the race of the **Kâkatîśas,** or, as they are more generally called, Kâkatîiyas. As in the Gaṇapêśvaram inscription (*ante*, p. 82), the list of kings opens with **Prôla** (v. 4). His son **Mâdhava** (v. 5) must be identical with Mahâdêva, who was the son of Prôla and younger brother of Rudra according to the Êkâmranâtha and Gaṇapêśvaram inscriptions. This **Mâdhava** is stated to have lost his life in battle (v. 5). His son was **Gaṇapati** (v. 6) or **Gaṇapa** (vv. 7, 15, 23), whose daughter was **Gaṇapâmbâ** (vv. 8, 21) or **Gaṇapâmbikâ** (vv. 9, 15, 25).

......Verses 10 to 14 describe a dynasty of local chiefs, who ruled over the district of **Konnâtavâḍî⁴** (v. 11) and resided at **Śrî-Dhânyâṅkapura⁵** (vv. 10, 17, 21), *i.e.* Amarâvatî in the Sattenapalle Tâlukâ of the Kistna district. These are : **Kêta⁶** (v. 10 f.), who gave away seventy *agrahâras* on the southern bank of the **Verṇâ⁷** (v. 12), his son **Rudra** (v. 13), and the latter’s son **Bêta** (v. 14). To this Bêta, the princess **Gaṇapâmbikâ** was given in marriage by her father **Gaṇapa** (v. 15).

......¹ See Mr. Sewell’s *Lists of Antiquities,* Vol. I. p. 319 f.  
......² *ibid*. p. 77. There is another village of the same name in the Narasarâvupêṭa tâlukâ ; *ibid*. p. 74.  
......³ In the abridged English translation, it is represented by the two last lines on p. 14 of the *Kistna Manual.*  
......⁴ According to the Telugu portion of the inscription (see p. 95 below), this district appears to have consisted of six thousand villages on the southern bank of the Kṛishṇâ river.  
......⁵ This name is synonymous with Dhaṁñakaṭa in two Prâkṛit inscriptions (*Zeitschr. D. M. G.* Vol. XXXVII. p. 548), and with Dhânyaghaṭa or Dhânyaghaṭaka in a Sanskṛit inscription (*South-Indian Inscriptions,* Vol. I. p. 25), all from Amarâvatî.  
......⁶ In his *Lists of Antiquities*, Vol. I. p. 64, Mr. Sewell notices three inscriptions of this chief on a pillar at the Amarêśvara temple in Amarâvatî. One of these is stated to contain the date Śaka-Saṁvat 1104.  
......⁷ Verṇâ and Vêṇî (*ante*, p. 91, verse 21), the Kṛishṇâ (Kistna) river.
