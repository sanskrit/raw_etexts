**C.— JAMBUKESVARA INSCRIPTION OF VALAKA-KAMAYA.  
  
Saka-Samvat 1403.**

......This inscription¹ is engraved on the month wall of the second *prâkâra* of the Śaiva temple of **Jambukêśvara** on the island of **Śrîraṅgam** near Trichinopoly. It is referred to in Mr. Moore’s *Trichinopoly Manual* (p. 341) and in Mr. R. Sewell’s *Lists of Antiquities* (Vol. I. p. 267) as the only inscription in the Jambukêśvara temple, which contains a date in the **Śaka era.** It consists of eight lines in modern **Tamil** characters, intermixed with a few words and syllables in the **Grantha** alphabet. The **language** is very faulty Tamil.

......The inscription records the grant of one *vêli* of land in the village of **Vaḍakarai-Veṇkônkuḍi²** to the god of **Tiruvânaikkâ.³ The date** of the grant was the day of **Mahâmâgha,** which fell on Sunday, the full-moon *tithi* of the month of Kumbha of **Śaka-Saṁvat 1403** expired, the **Plava** *saṁvatsara.* Mr. Dikshit kindly informed the Editor that the European equivalent of this date is **Sunday, the 3rd February, A.D. 1482.** The donor was the great provincial chief (*mahâmaṇḍalêśvara*) **Vâlaka-Kâmaya,** *alias* **Akkalarâja,** who bore the titles of “a Bhîma among the **Chôḷas,**” “a Vishṇu among the **Chôḷas**” (*Śôla-Nârâyaṇa*), and “the lord of **Uraiyûr⁴** the best of cities” (*Uraiyûr-puravar-âdhîśvara*). Though it is very doubtful if he had any real connection with the ancient indigenous dynasty of the Chôḷas, he claimed at any rate to be their rightful successor ; and his name has been accordingly included in Dr. Hultzsch’s preliminary list of Chôḷa kings.⁵ His title *mahâmaṇḍalêśvara* suggests that he was a dependant, probably of one of the last kings of the first **Vijayanagara dynasty.⁶**
