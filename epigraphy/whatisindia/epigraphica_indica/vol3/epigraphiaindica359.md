****KANCHI INSCRIPTION OF VIKRAMADITYA.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

of **Kâsîllî in the Śrâvastî maṇḍala** (l. 38), a resident of **Sîṅgôâgrâma in the Dêvîbhôga vishaya in Kôsala** (ll. 38-39), belonging to the Kauśika *gôtra,* with the *pravara* of Viśvâmitra, Dêvarâta, and Audala, and a student of the Chhandôga *śâkhÃ¢*.

......Lines 44 to 66 are occupied with the usual mandate to future kings to continue the grant and with benedictive and imprecatory verses.

......Lines 66 to 69 praise a minister of the king, named **Siṅgadatta**, holding the office of *Saṁdhivigrahin,*— and, in doing so, use the verse which in E. is applied in the case of Chhchchhaṭêsa.

......A verse in lines 69 and 70 tells us that the charter was written by the *Kâyastha* Maṅgaladatta.

......And lines 70 **to the end give the date of the third tithi in the bright fortnight of the month Mârga or Mârgaśîrsha in the third year of the victorious reign** of the most devout worshipper of (the god) Mahêśvara, the *Paramabhaṭṭâraka,* the *Mahârâjâdhirâja,* the *Paramêśvara,* **the ornament of the Sômakula, the lord of the three Kaliṅgas,** the glorious **BhîmarathadÃªva.**

**No. 48.─ KANCHI INSCRIPTION OF VIKRAMADITYA.  
  
BY E. HULTZSCH, PH. D.**

......In editing the Kûram plates of the Pallava king Paramêśvaravarman I., I noticed a Kanarese inscription in the **Kailâsanâtha** temple at **Conjeeveram,** which proves that a king Vikramâditya, who is shown by his surnames to belong to the Western Chalukya dynasty, captured Kâñchî and visited the temple.¹ I now edit this record from excellent inked estampages. recently prepared by my Tamil Assistant, Mr. T. P. Krishnasvami Sastri, M.A.

......As stated in my former notice, the inscription is engraved on the back of a pillar of the *maṇḍapa* in front of the **Râjasiṁhêśvara** shrine, and nearly touches the east wall of another *maṇḍapa* which, at a later time, has been erected between the shrine and the front *maṇḍapa*. This circumstance makes it impossible to read the inscription from the stone and renders the preparation of good estampage a work of some difficulty. The **alphabet** of the inscription is Old-Kanarese ; and the language is **Kanarese** prose, with the exception of the concluding sentence, which is half Sanskṛit and half Kanarese.

......The inscription records that, after his conquest of **Kañchi,² Vikramâditya-Satyâśraya** did not confiscate the property of the **Râjasiṁhêśvara** temple, but returned it to the god. It ends with an imprecation, and with the names of the writer and of another official who superintended him.

......In the inscription of the **Western Chalukyas of Bâdâmi,** both Vikramâditya I. and Vikramâditya II. are stated to have taken Kâñchî,— the former from Îśvarapôtarâja, *i.e.* the Pallava king Paramêśvaravarman I.,³ and the latter from Nandipôtavarman. Though the subjoined inscription is not dated and might thus belong to the reign of either of the two Vikramâdityas, it may be assigned with great probability to **Vikramâditya II.,** because the Wokkalêri plates explicitly state that the latter, after his conquest of **Kâñchî,** made gifts to the **Râjasiṁhêśvara** temple.⁴

......² According to Mr. Kittel’s *Dictionary,* Kañchi is a Kanarese *tadbhava* of Kâñchî (Conjeevaram). It occurs also in a Kanarese inscription of Gôvinda III. ; *Ind. Ant.* Vol. XI. p. 127.  
......³ See *South-Indian Inscription,* Vol. I. p. 145.
