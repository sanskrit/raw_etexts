****UDAYENDIRAM PLATES OF NANDIVARMAN.****

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Antiquary,* Vol. VIII. p. 273 ff. Dr. Hultzsch thinks that this grant and its endorsement, the characters of both of which are modern, were copied from a lost, but genuine original. The original of the grant of Nandivarman Pallavamalla must now¹ be assigned to about the first half of the 8th century A.D. As pointed out to me Dr. Hultzsch, the lost original of the Tamil endorsements of the grant of Pallavamalla must belong to the time of **the Chôḷa king Parântaka I.,²** and presupposes the original of the grant of Pallavamalla, because it refers to the village of Udayachandramaṅgalam, which was only founded by that grant. Probably both endorsements which we possess now, were copied at different times from the endorsement on the lost original of the grant of Nandivarman Pallavamalla. To judge from the alphabets employed, the endorsement of the subjoined grant may actually belong to the time of Parântaka I., while the existing copy of the Pallavamalla grant and of its endorsement has to be assigned to still more recent period.

......As regards **the localities** which, in addition to **Kâñchîpura,** are mentioned in this inscription, Mr. Foulkes has already stated that the village of **Kâñchivâyil,** under its Sanskṛit name of Kâñchîdvâra, is mentioned in line 72 of the grant of Pallavamalla,³ and that the same grant, in the word *Âśrayanadî-vishaya* in line 62, contains the Sanskṛit equivalent of the term **Aḍêyâra-râshṭra⁴** of the present inscription. The village of **Udayachandramaṅgalam** is probably identical with the modern Udayêndiram, which in another inscription is called Udayêndumaṅgala.⁵

......See *South-Indian Inscriptions,* Vol. I. pp. 11 and 145.  
......² See *ibid.* p. 112.  
......³ See also *Ind. Ant.* Vol. XXII. p. 66 f.  
......⁴ Aḍêyâra is either a mistake for, or an attempt to Sanskṛitise, Aḍaiyâṛu, ‘the river of refuge,’ which occurs in another Udayêndiram grant ; *Salem Manual,* Vol. II. p. 371, plate vi. *a,* text line 2 f.  
......⁵ See *ante,* p. 75.  
......⁶ From an impression received from Dr. Hultzsch.  
......⁷ This is the actual reading of the original. It is most probably intended for *râjñâ,* but this word is meaningless and superfluous here.  
......⁸ Here one or more words have been omitted. Dr. Fleet’s Uruvupalli grant (*Ind, Ant.* Vol. V. p. 51) has *-ôrjita-kshâtra-tapônidhêḥ* ; the same reading we have in Dr. Hultzsch’s fragment, *Ep. Ind.* Vol. I. p. 398 ; and similar expressions occur elsewhere.  
......⁹ Read –*maryâdasya râjñaḥ.*  
......¹⁰ Read *ºtrô=bhyaº.*  
......¹¹ Originally *vaśudhâlaivîkara* was engraved ; but the *aksharas ta* and *ka* are added below the line, and the *ka* between *vî* and *ra* is struck out.  
......¹² Read –*Siṁhavarmmaṇaḥ pautrô.*  
......¹³ Read -*vṛiddh-ôpachâyinô vṛiddha-vinayasya.*  
......¹⁴ The *akshara sau* before *gô* is quite meaningless ; what one would have expected, is *anêka-gô-.*  
......¹⁵ Read –*âdi-pradânaiḥ pracṛiddha-.*
