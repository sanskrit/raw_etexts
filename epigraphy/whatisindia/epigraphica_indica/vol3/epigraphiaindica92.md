------------------------------------------------------------------------

......(V. 36.) Then king **Gaṇapati** took to wife that **Nârama** and **Pêrama,** whose beauty, elegance and grace were unrivalled in the three worlds.

......(V. 37.) The king welcomed and took into his service their younger brother, the handsome **Jâyana,** who, in spite of his youth, commanded respect on account of the great modesty, wisdom, cleverness, firmness, profundity and bravery, indicated by (*his*) face.

......(V. 38.) Then, pleased by (*his*) deeds, the king joyfully granted to this **Jâyana** the dignity of a general (*and*) of a commander of the elephant-troop, along with a palanquin, a parasol, and other emblems.

......(V. 39.) Having been appointed general by his lord, surrounded by wise men, (*and*) full of power, young **Jâya,** the slayer of hostile warriors, resembles (*the god*) Kumâra, who has been appointed general by (Indra) the lord of the gods, is surrounded by gods, (*and*) bears a spear.

......(V. 40.) The edge of his sword (*is*) the only messenger, (*announcing*) to powerful enemies (*their approaching*) union with celestial nymphs ; (*and*) his policy (*is*) the messenger, (*announcing*) to his beloved (*master*) the union with the fortunes of other kings.

......(V. 41.) He who was distinguished by the name **Vairigôdhûmagharaṭṭa,¹** formerly became a (*mere*) mouthful for the point of his (*viz*. Jâya’s) sword, that was about to devour all the brave enemies in battles.

......(V. 42.) He is ashamed at the praise of (*his*) liberality, which meets (*his*) ears, (*thinking*), it seems² :― “What are my gifts (*worth*), (*if*) a single lord of the twice-born (*viz*. the Moon) gets entirely emaciated in every (*dark*) fortnight ; (*if*) a single scholar (*viz*. the planet Mercury), having lost most of his wealth (*or light*), always approaches (*another*) wealthy man (*viz*. the Sun); (*and if*) a single poet (*viz*. the planet Venus), being bewildered, does not rise for some days ?”

......(V. 43.) He possesses offspring in the shape of the following seven (*acts*) which (*he*) has duly fulfilled :― (*The procreation of*) a son, the composition (*of a poem*), (*the hoarding of*) a treasure, (*the planting of* ) a grove, the marriage (*of a girl to a Brâhmaṇa*), (*the consecration of*) a temple, and (*the construction of*) a tank.³

......(V. 44.) In this **Dvîpa,** founded by his grandfather **Nârâyaṇa,⁴** this general **Jâya** himself caused to be built, out of true devotion, this lofty (*and*) substantial temple, equal to the Kailâsa mountain, of Mahâdêva, who has the shape of a *liṅga* (*and*) is called **Gaṇapêśvara** after the name of king **Gaṇapati.**

......(V. 45.) In the **Śâka** (*year*) measured by the qualities (3), the arrows (5), and the Bhavas (11),⁵ (*i.e.* **1153**), in the (*cyclic*) year **Khara,** in the bright (*fortnight*) of Mâdhava,⁶ on the *tithi* of Gaurî,― **Jâya** performed the consecration of this blessed **Gaṇapatîśvara.**

....................................***B.― Telugu Portion.***

......(Line 121.) To the god Mahâdêva of the **Gaṇapatîśvara** (*temple*) at **Divi** the various inhabitants of the eighteen districts (*vishaya*) (*on*) both (*sides of the* Kṛishṇâ *river*) gave at **Naṅgegaḍḍa** (*as*) revenue a large fanam (*chinna*) on (*every*) boat.

......¹ *i.e.* ‘the grinding-stone to the wheat (which was) the enemy.’ This must have been a surname of the first of Jâya’s artagonists.  
......² The *actual* reason of Jâya’s being ashamed at the praise of his liberality is, of course, his great modesty.  
......³ These are the seven kinds offspring (*saṁtâna* or *saṁtati*) to which verse 9 of the Vanapalli plates of Anna-Vêma alludes ; *ante*, p. 64, note 3.  
......⁴ Bhava is used for 11, because it is synonymous with Rudra. Compare Śiva-śata – 1100, *Ind. Ant.* Vol. XXI. p. 202, note 48.  
......⁵ This is another name of the lunar month of Vaiśâkha.
