##PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION
We personally feel great pleasure and satisfaction in presenting the 
second edition of the AvadAnasataka before the Indologists. Dr. P.L. Vaidya
alearned Director of the Mithila Research Institute, Darbhanga, Bihar had 
the privilege to publish this AvadAna in 1958. Since its first publication the 
book earned so much popularity and fame that the entire published copies
now remain out of print. Considering its dies necessity we decided to publish 
its our earliest commence. 
It would not be quite irrelevant to say a few words about the book and its
popularity in domain of the Buddhist world. In the opinion of some selected 
Indologists, this AvadAna appears to have been compiled by Acarys Thandi-
svara. Also the name of Nandisvara has come to light as a compiler of this 
AvadAna. In reality the stories of the AvadAna connect our mind to the mean-
ing of the Buddhahood. Some stories deal with the miseries which are con-
sidered to be the result of our faults and misdeeds. 
The AvadAnasataka contains hundred stories being categorieally divided 
into ten sections (the vargs). Each and every story has adifferent live of 
treatment. As regards the previous birth of Buddha, the AvadAna seems to 
have followed the jatak style. Although the fifth story is missing and we 
have no evidence as to why this disorder took place. 
In the openion of the famous Russian Historian Wassilijew, the AvadAna
sataka was compiled when the sakys muni preached his first semeon. 
According to B. Nonzio its first Chinese translation was finished between 
223-253 A. D. The Dinara coin is frequently mentioned in the stories and it 
may therefore be presumed that the AvadAna was compiled in the first cen-
tury A. D. on the chronological basis it was finally compiled in the second
century A. D.
The present stories, compiled in this AvadAna have close similarities of 
that of the Parinirvanasutra and other Sarvastivada school of thought. Hence
the AvadAna is a complete formof the Hinayana school. The worship of the 
Tathagats seems to have got prime importance throughout the stories but 
they remain totally isolated from the Bodhisattve cult. In present form, the 
AvadAna is a purely Sanskrit text of the Theravada school of thought. In the 
Chinese translation the text takes the Hinayana form and also lacks the 
MahAyAnc principles. On the whole the AvadAnasataks displays the simple
style and its stories are frequently repeated at many places. Besides the first 
ten stories the remaining stories of this AvadAna are of purely Hinaryana 
nature. In the beginning the Buddha comes to delight his personality and also
@x
talks about the miseries of life and the ways leading to complete liberation. 
The Bhikkhv audience preuses the Buddhadesana (preaching of the Buddha).
In the stories the ways of liberation have been fully discussed and analysed. 
An Arahat is also defined in some selected stories. The AvadAna also makes 
it clear that a son is needed for not only representing his ancestral values but 
also for leading the humanity towards the reality of life. How a pregnaut 
woman is treated and how a new born baby is served, are some of the inter- 
esting features of the stories. Even the stories deal with the just ruler of a
country and the theory of Karma is discussed. In them we find a series of 
Gods approaching the new born Buddha who again tells mystery of his pre-
vious birth. The AvadAna also presents a number of examples similar to that 
of the DivyAvadAna but they are different to some extent. 
In nature and then the AvadAnasataka is of different type from the other 
AvadAnas compiledn by the MahayAnists. Here the Boddhisattve comes to 
serve as an attendant of the Buddha. The stories dealing with the biographics
of Sukavati and Amitabha also testify our arguments. 
If appears that the AvadAnas compiled in this text are neither controlled 
nor inspired by a definite space of time, but they seem to be related to some 
refined ideals. As a rule, the complied stories are of orthodoxy nature. Most
of the stories are frequently mentioned and they contain almost the same 
pattern. 
In some of the stories we come across with a man of pious character, a
king with power and fame, manage with joy and Flavour, a young boy with 
proformed knowledge of all sciences and the personality of Buddha with his 
previous achievements. Here the Buddha proclaims that a man may also be 
considered as Buddha and can attain the Buddhahood before deelaring the 
future incidents, he suites and then the multiceloured rays came out from his 
face. In reality, the present AvadAna exhibits its fantastic nature but some of 
the stories inspire the readers with the real values of life. If further remainds 
of some peculiadties which are not found in many Buddhist works. 
There are reasons to believe that the work has acquired a very wide 
reputation among the India and foreing Indologists. Seeing its even increas-
ing demand we have strongly felt the dire necessity of the second edition and 
this is why if is being published at our earliest convenience. 
Since nothing new has come to light after its first publication. the book is 
being published with no change. The original text and materials explained so 
far have been left untouched. We hope, this edition also will be widely wel-
comed in the same spirit. Further suggestions if any are cordially invited.

INTRODUCTION
(1) THE EDITION 
THE AvadAnasataka or Century of Noble Deeds of Lord
Buddha was edited by Dr. J. S. Speyer of Leiden University 
(Holland) and published in the Bibliotheca Buddhica III, in 
1906-9 (B in marginal references). The present edition is based on 
this edition, with such modifications as required by modern trends 
of thought and advance in textual criticism. For fixing his text 
Dr. Speyer utilized four Mss., three in Nepalese and one in 
Devanagari scripts and fragments of a fifth. He utilised also the 
Tibetan and Chinese translations, Feer’s French translation of the 
work, as also the texts of the DivyavadAna, KalpadrumavadAna, 
BhadrakalpavadAna, AsokavadAna, VicitrakarnikavadAna, Ratna-
vadanamala, DvatrimsatyavadAnamala and avadAnakalpalata of 
Ksemendra. His careful study of this vast material has given us
a very readable text of this work. Many of his foot-notes may
appear to be superfluous now as textual criticism has made a
great advance since the days of Speyer: they only indicate a very 
methodical handling of his Mss. material. I have retained as 
many of his foot-notes as appeared to me quite necessary. 
2) THE AvadAna LITERATURE
The term AvadAna, Sk. Apadana, primarily means good, 
illustrious, heroic or noble act. It sometimes designates
Buddhavacana and constitutes seventh of the twelve Dharma
Pravacanas of Sanskrit Buddhism. There must have been a vast 
literature under this class of which only a fraction is preserved 
in Mss. We have got only four works in print, viz., DivyavadAna, 
Jatakamala, avadAnakalpalata and the present work. Afew more
are printed here and there. It appears from references in the 
KalpadrumavadAnamala, tenth story of which is printed here in 
Appendix I, that some scholars specialised in this class of litera-
ture and were known as AvadAnarthakovida (St. 162) or 
Avadanika (St. 106), just as some monks were called Suttantika
or Abhidhammika or Suttadhara and Vinayadhara. The
AvadAna type of literature, is closely related to the Jataka litera-
ture with this difference that jataka stories usually refer to the 
past life of Buddha as Bodhisattva, while in AvadAnas Buddha
himself plays an important role. 
@xii
The AvadAnas and Jatakas do not belong to the higher 
plane of Buddhist teaching; they do not pretend to afford scope 
for higher philosophical study or meditation, and hence perhaps
works like Jataka, Apadana, Petavatthu, Vimanavatthu, Buddha- 
vamsa, Cariyapitaka, Theragatha and Therigatha do not find 
place in Siamese Tripitaka. They are foundto have a place in 
the Vinaya and Sutta Pitaka in their Pali and Sanskrit versions. 
The AvadAna Literature can be classified in to three types, 
two of them canonical and the third post-canonical. The first is 
to be found in Vinaya texts or Sutras in the episodes or examples 
of rules. The DivyavadAna belongs to this class. The second
canonical type is represented by Apadana and Jataka. The third 
is represented by all later collections of AvadAnas or single 
avadAnas, remnants of which in Sanskrit constitute only a small 
portion of what once existed. 
3 THE AVADANASATAKA AND ITS TRANSLATIONS 
The AvadAnasataka, according to Wessillief, belongs to 
the first preaching period of Sakyamuni, indicating a high 
antiquity of the work. It was translated into Chinese in the first 
half of the 3rd century A. D. as stated in Nanjio’s Catalogue, 
No. 1324. In AvadAna No. 83 there is a mention of Dinara as a
minted coin (laksanahatam dinaradvayam). This indicates
that the present collection must be placed later than the beginning 
of the Chistian era. It would not be far from wrong if we place
the date of the present work at about 100 A.D. The Tibetan trans- 
Lation of the AvadAnasataka is found in Tanjur, Mdo. XXIX. 
Burnouf drew attention of scholars in his work Introduction a
l’ Histoire du Buddhisme and gave translations of portions from it. 
Leon Feer published a translation of the whole work in French 
in AMG. Vol. XVIII, using the Tibetan translation. Dr. Speyer
frequently refers to this translation as well as personal corres-
pondence with Feer in his notes in deciding doubtful passages of 
the text. He has also utilized the DivyavadAna, and several 
unpublished AvadAnas in manuscripts. 
4 THE CONTENTS
The stories in the AvadAnasataka are divided into ten 
sections or vargas of ten stories each. The fifth story is unfor-
tunately lost in the original Sanskrit, but is preserved in its
@xiii
Tibetan translation. Each section has a special feature of its own.
The first and third sections deal with prophecies or vyakaranas of 
future Buddhahood and Pratyekabuddhahood. The second and 
fourth (with the exception of No. 40) contain AvadAnas of the
Buddha in his former existences; though in the second section 
the story of the present is the main tale, in the fourth the story of 
the past is predominant, and in that respect resembles a Jataka. 
The fifth section is devoted to stories about Pretas, several of 
which resemble those in the Petavatthu. The sixth section 
contains stories of persons, who, due to the merit of some pious 
act., obtained Svarga. In sections seven to ten, the heroes 
become Arhats. The heroes of the seventh are all Sakyas; those 
of the eighth are all women. The tenth section contains stories 
emphasizing the evil effects of bad acts in former existences which
have acused sufferings to holy persons even in their last existence. 
The last AvadAna of the collections brings the main story up to 
the days of Asoka and Upagupta. 
It should be noted here that the AvadAnasataka is a 
Sanskrit work belonging to Hinayana or Theravada School. 
According some scholars it belongs to the Sarvastivada School of 
Hinayana. The Chinese Buddhism knows it as such, for the 
Hinayana type is noticeable by complete absence of MahAyana
concepts, by relative simplicityof style, and by repetition of several 
stereotyped phrases. 
This topic of repetitions of set phrases in the work requires 
further elaboration. I have given in Appendix II, over twenty- 
five passages which may be said to be constituent parts of stories 
in the Collection. I may mention a few:-The opening passage 
describing Buddha; the closing phrase of approbation of Buddha’s
discourse by monks; description of the smile of Buddha and its 
significance; Buddha’s looking over the world for somebody in 
distress whom he might rescue; qualities of Arhatship; natural 
causes of begetting children; treatment of pregnant lady, and 
nurses for the baby; the country and the king; the formula of 
Karmavipaka; nocturnal visits of some newly-born gods to 
Buddha, and the introduction to the stories of the past by Baddha
at the demand of his monks. Many of these passages are found 
in the DivyavadAna, sometimes in full, sometimes in their abrid-
ged form introduced by## yAvat, ##But AvadAnasataka never uses the 
usual forms of abridgement such as## yAvat ##or## peyyAlaM, ##and always 
gives them in full. 
@xiv
I should like to draw the attention of the reader to a
chronological statement in story No. 100, in which the time which 
elapsed between Buddha’s Parinirvana and the days of Asoka
and Upagupta is mentioned as hundred years, while the tradition 
as recorded by Buddhaghosa, with a detailed chronological data, 
gives this to be 218 years. A good deal of the text of Nos. 40 and 
100 has been borrowed from a Sanskrit redaction of the Maha-
parinirvana Sutra. There are similar parallelisms; e. g., a portion 
of No. 99 is equal to Majjhima Nikaya No. 74, and of No. 90
equal to No. 82. 
There is one more point to be noted. The difference 
between AvadAnasataka and other AvadAnamalas is that the 
authors of the latter works were followers of Mahayana. The intro- 
duction of Bodhisattvas among attendants of Buddha, references 
to Amitabha and Sukhavati in those works clearly prove this 
point.
